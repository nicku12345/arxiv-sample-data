Let H be a Hopf algebra and \mathcal{LR}(H) the category of Yetter-Drinfel'd-Long bimodules over H. We first give sufficient and necessary conditions for \mathcal{LR}(H) to be symmetry and pseudosymmetry, respectively. We then introduce the definition of u-condition in \mathcal{LR}(H) and discuss the relation between the u-condition and the symmetry of \mathcal{LR}(H). Finally, we show that \mathcal{LR}(H) over a triangular (cotriangular, resp.) Hopf algebra contains a rich symmetric subcategory.
