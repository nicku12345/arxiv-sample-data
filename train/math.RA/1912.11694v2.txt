It is shown that the orbits of the space of local deformations of the Lie algebra \bar{A_5} over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic 2 with respect to the automorphism group \mathrm{PGL} (6) correspond to \mathrm{GL} (V)-orbits of tri-vectors of a 6-dimensional space. For local deformations corresponding to tri-vectors of rank \rho <6, integrability is proved and global deformations are constructed.
