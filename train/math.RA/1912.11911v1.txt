A graded-division algebra is an algebra graded by a group such that all nonzero homogeneous elements are invertible. This includes division algebras equipped with an arbitrary group grading (including the trivial grading). We show that a classification of finite-dimensional graded-central graded-division algebras over an arbitrary field \mathbb{F} can be reduced to the following three classifications, for each finite Galois extension \mathbb{L} of \mathbb{F}: (1) finite-dimensional central division algebras over \mathbb{L}, up to isomorphism; (2) twisted group algebras of finite groups over \mathbb{L}, up to graded-isomorphism; (3) \mathbb{F}-forms of certain graded matrix algebras with coefficients in \Delta\otimes_{\mathbb{L}}\mathcal{C} where \Delta is as in (1) and \mathcal{C} is as in (2). As an application, we classify, up to graded-isomorphism, the finite-dimensional graded-division algebras over the field of real numbers (or any real closed field) with an abelian grading group. We also discuss group gradings on fields.
