We define a unital algebra A over a field \mathbb{F} to be nearly simple if A contains a unique non-trivial ideal I_A such that I_A^2 \neq \{0\}. If A and B are two nearly simple algebras, we consider the ideal structure of their tensor product A \otimes B. The obvious non-trivial ideals of A \otimes B are: I_A \otimes I_B, \quad I_A \otimes B, \quad A \otimes I_B, \quad \mbox{and} \quad I_A \otimes B + A \otimes I_B. The purpose of this paper is to characterize when are all non-trivial ideals of A \otimes B of the above form.
