Let V be a linear space over a field {\bf k} with a braiding \tau : V\otimes V\rightarrow V\otimes V. We prove that the braiding \tau has a unique extension on the free nonassociative algebra {\bf k}\{V\} freely generated by V so that {\bf k}\{V\} is a braided algebra. Moreover, we prove that the free braided algebra {\bf k}\{V\} has a natural structure of a braided nonassociative Hopf algebra such that every element of the space of generators V is primitive. In the case of involutive braidings, \tau^2={\rm id}, we describe braided analogues of Shestakov-Umirbaev operations and prove that these operations are primitive operations. We introduce a braided version of Sabinin algebras and prove that the set of all primitive elements of a nonassociative \tau-algebra is a Sabinin \tau-algebra.
