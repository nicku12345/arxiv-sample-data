We prove that the group of tame automorphisms of a free Lie algebra (as well as of a free anticommutative algebra) rank 3 over an arbitrary integral domain has the structure of an amalgamated free product. We construct an example of a wild automorphism of a free Lie algebra (as well as of a free anticommutative algebra) of rank 3 over an arbitrary Euclidean ring analogous to the Anick automorphism for free associative algebras.
