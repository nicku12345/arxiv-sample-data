Let F be a field of characteristic zero, G be a group and R be the algebra M_n(F) with a G-grading. Bahturin and Drensky proved that if R is an elementary and the neutral component is commutative then the graded identities of R follow from three basic types of identities and monomial identities of length \geq 2 bounded by a function f(n) of n. In this paper we prove the best upper bound is f(n)=n, more generally we prove that all the graded monomial identities of an elementary G-grading on M_n(F) follow from those of degree at most n. We also study gradings which satisfy no monomial identities but the trivial ones, which we call almost non-degenerate gradings. The description of non-degenerate elementary gradings on matrix algebras is reduced to the description of non-degenerate elementary gradings on matrix algebras that have commutative neutral component. We provide necessary conditions so that the grading on R is almost non-degenerate and we apply the results on monomial identities to describe all almost non-degenerate \mathbb{Z}-gradings on M_n(F) for n\leq 5.
