The Zero divisor Graph of a commutative ring R, denoted by \Gamma[R], is a graph whose vertices are non-zero zero divisors of R and two vertices are adjacent if their product is zero. The compressed zero divisor graph \Gamma_E[R] is the (undirected) graph whose vertices are the equivalence classes such that distinct vertices [r] and [s] are adjacent if and only if rs = 0. In this paper we derive the characteristic polynomial and Wiener index of the Compressed zero divisor graph \Gamma_{E}[\mathbb{Z}_m] where m=p^n with prime p.
