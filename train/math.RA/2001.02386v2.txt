We introduce a notion of oriented dialgebra and develop a cohomology theory for oriented dialgebras based on the possibility to mix the standard chain complexes computing group cohomology and associative dialgebra cohomology. We also introduce a 1-parameter formal deformation theory for oriented dialgebras and show that cohomology of oriented dialgebras controls such deformations.
