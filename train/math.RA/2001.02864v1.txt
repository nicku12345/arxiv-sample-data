In this paper, we introduce and study a strict generalization of symmetric rings. We call a ring R \,\,\, 'P-symmetric' if for any a,\, b,\, c\in R,\, abc=0 implies bac\in P(R), where P(R) is the prime radical of R. It is shown that the class of P-symmetric rings lies between the class of central symmetric rings and generalized weakly symmetric rings. Relations are provided between P-symmetric rings and some other known classes of rings. From an arbitrary P-symmetric ring, we produce many families of P-symmetric rings.
