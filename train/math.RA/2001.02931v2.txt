Classes of multisorted minions closed under extensions, reflections, and direct powers are considered from a relational point of view. As a generalization of a result of Barto, Opr\v{s}al, and Pinsker, the closure of a multisorted minion is characterized in terms of constructions on multisorted relation pairs which are invariant for minions.
