We apply minimal weakly generating sets to study the existence of Add(U_R)-covers for a uniserial module U_R. If U_R is a uniserial right module over a ring R, then S:=End (U_R) has at most two maximal (right, left, two-sided) ideals: one is the set I of all endomorphisms that are not injective, and the other is the set K  of all endomorphisms of U_R that are not surjective. We prove that if U_R is either finitely generated, or artinian, or I \subset K, then the class Add(U_R) is covering if and only if it is closed under direct limit. Moreover, we study endomorphism rings of artinian uniserial modules giving several examples.
