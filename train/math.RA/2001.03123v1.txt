Let \k be a field, and let A and B be connected \N-graded \k-algebras. The algebra A is said to be a graded right-free extension of B provided there is a surjective graded algebra morphism \pi: A \to B such that \ker\pi is free as a right A-module. Suppose that B is graded left coherent, and that A is a graded right-free extension of B. We characterize when A is also graded left coherent. We apply our criterion to prove graded coherence of certain non-Noetherian graded twisted tensor products.
