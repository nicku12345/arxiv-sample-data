As the main achievement of the paper, we construct a three-generated, 2-distributive, atomless lattice that is not finitely presented. Also, the paper contains the following three observations. First, every coatomless three-generated lattice has at least one atom. Second, we give some sufficient conditions implying that a three-generated lattice has at most three atoms. Third, we present a three-generated meet-distributive lattice with four atoms.
