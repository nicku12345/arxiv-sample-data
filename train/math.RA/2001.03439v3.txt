The purpose of this paper is to study the (different) notions of homo-derivations. These are additive mappings f of a ring R that also fulfill the identity \[ f(xy)=f(x)y+xf(y)+f(x)f(y) \qquad \left(x, y\in R\right),   \] or (in case of the other notion) the system of equations \[ f(xy)=f(x)f(y)\] \[f(xy)=f(x)y+xf(y) \qquad \left(x, y\in R\right).\] Our primary aim is to investigate the above equations without additivity as well as the following Pexiderized equation \[ f(xy)=h(x)h(y)+xk(y)+k(x)y. \] The obtained results show that under rather mild assumptions homo-derivations can be fully characterized, even without the additivity assumption.
