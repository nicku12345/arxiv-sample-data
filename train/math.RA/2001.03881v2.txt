We extend existing results on locally nilpotent differential polynomial rings to skew extensions of rings. We prove that if \mathscr{G}=\{\sigma_t\}_{t\in T} is a locally finite family of automorphisms of an algebra R, \mathscr{D}=\{\delta_t\}_{t\in T} is a family of skew derivations of R such that the prime radical P of R is strongly invariant under \mathscr{D}, then the ideal P\langle T,\mathscr{G},\mathscr{D}\rangle^* of R\langle T,\mathscr{G},\mathscr{D}\rangle, generated by P, is locally nilpotent. We then apply this result to algebras with locally nilpotent derivations. We prove that any algebra R over a field of characteristic 0, having a surjective locally nilpotent derivation d with commutative kernel, and such that R is generated by \ker d^2, has a locally nilpotent Jacobson radical.
