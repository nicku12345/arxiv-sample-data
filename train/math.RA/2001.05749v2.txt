Rickard proved that for certain self-injective algebras, a stable equivalence induced from an exact functor is a stable equivalence of Morita type, in the sense of Brou\'{e}. In this paper we study singular equivalences of finite dimensional algebras induced from tensor product functors. We prove that for certain Gorenstein algebras, a singular equivalence induced from tensoring with a suitable complex of bimodules, induces a singular equivalence of Morita type with level, in the sense of Wang. This recovers Rickard's theorem in the self-injective case.
