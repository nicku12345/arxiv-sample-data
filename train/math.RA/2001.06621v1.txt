The paper is devoted to the study of pro-solvable Lie algebras whose maximal pro-nilpotent ideal is either \mathfrak{m}_0 or \mathfrak{m}_2. Namely, we describe such Lie algebras and establish their completeness. Triviality of the second cohomology group for one of the obtained algebra is established.
