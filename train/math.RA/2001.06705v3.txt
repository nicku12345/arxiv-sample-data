Congruence modular and congruence distributive varieties can be characterized by the existence of sequences of Gumm and J\'onsson terms, respectively. Such sequences have variable lengths, in general. It is immediate from the above paragraph that there is a variety with Gumm terms but without J\'onsson terms. We prove the quite unexpected result that, on the other hand, if some variety has both kinds of terms, then the minimal lengths of the sequences differ at most by 1. It follows that every r-modular congruence distributive variety is r^2-r+2-distributive.
