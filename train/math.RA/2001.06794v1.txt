For every action \phi\in\text{Hom}(G,\text{Aut}_k(K)) of a group G on a commutative ring K we introduce two abelian monoids. The monoid \text{Cliff}_k(\phi) consists of equivalent classes of G-graded Clifford system extensions of type \phi of K-central algebras. The monoid \mathcal{C}_k{(\phi)} consists of equivariant classes of generalized collective characters of type \phi from G to the Picard groups of K-central algebras. Furthermore, for every such \phi there is an exact sequence of abelian monoids 0\to H^2(G,K^*_{\phi})\to\text{Cliff}_k(\phi)\to\mathcal{C}_k{(\phi)}\to H^3(G,K^*_{\phi}). The rightmost homomorphism is often surjective, terminating the above sequence. When \phi is a Galois action, then the restriction-obstruction sequence of Brauer groups is an image of an exact sequence of sub-monoids of this sequence.
