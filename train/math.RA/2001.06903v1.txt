We continue the analysis of the weak commutativity construction for Lie algebras. This is the Lie algebra \chi(\mathfrak{g}) generated by two isomorphic copies \mathfrak{g} and \mathfrak{g}^{\psi} of a fixed Lie algebra, subject to the relations [x,x^{\psi}]=0 for all x \in \mathfrak{g}. In this article we study the ideal L =L(\mathfrak{g}) generated by x-x^{\psi} for all x \in \mathfrak{g}. We obtain an (infinite) presentation for L as a Lie algebra, and we show that in general it cannot be reduced to a finite one. With this in hand, we study the question of nilpotency. We show that if \mathfrak{g} is nilpotent of class c, then \chi(\mathfrak{g}) is nilpotent of class at most c+2, and this bound can improved to c+1 if \mathfrak{g} is 2-generated or if c is odd. We also obtain concrete descriptions of L(\mathfrak{g}) (and thus of \chi(\mathfrak{g})) if \mathfrak{g} is free nilpotent of class 2 or 3. Finally, using methods of Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases we show that the abelian ideal R(\mathfrak{g}) = [\mathfrak{g}, [L, \mathfrak{g}^{\psi}]] is infinite-dimensional if \mathfrak{g} is free of rank at least 3.
