If this article, an elementary kernel-cokernel exact sequence is introduced for A\stackrel{f}\to B\stackrel{g}\to C. Some relative sequences and applications are dicussed. This result can simplify some proofs---the indices of Frodholm operators, Harada and Sai theorem, and the derived couples of exact couples.
