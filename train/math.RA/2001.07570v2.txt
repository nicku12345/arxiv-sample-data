After endowing with a 3-Lie-Rinehart structure on Hom 3-Lie algebras, we obtain a class of special   Hom 3-Lie algebras, which have close relationships with representations of commutative associative algebras. We provide a special class of Hom 3-Lie-Rinehart algebras, called split regular Hom 3-Lie-Rinehart algebras, and we then characterize their structures by means of root systems and weight systems associated to a splitting Cartan subalgebra.
