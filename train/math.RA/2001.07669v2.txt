We propose the notion of globalization for geometric partial comodules in a monoidal category and show its existence in many cases of interest, such as partial actions of monoids on sets, geometric partial coactions in abelian categories, partial comodule algebras and partial (co)representations of Hopf algebras. Our results subsume several globalization theorems appearing in literature.
