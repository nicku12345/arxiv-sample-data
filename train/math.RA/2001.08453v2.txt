Given a set \Sigma of equations, the free-algebra functor F_{\Sigma} associates to each set X of variables the free algebra F_{\Sigma}(X) over X. Extending the notion of \emph{derivative} \Sigma' for an arbitrary set \Sigma of equations, originally defined by Dent, Kearnes, and Szendrei, we show that F_\Sigma preserves preimages if and only if \Sigma \vdash \Sigma', i.e. \Sigma derives its derivative \Sigma'. If F_\Sigma weakly preserves kernel pairs, then every equation p(x,x,y)=q(x,y,y) gives rise to a term s(x,y,z,u) such that p(x,y,z)=s(x,y,z,z) and q(x,y,z)=s(x,x,y,z). In this case n-permutable varieties must already be permutable, i.e. Mal'cev. Conversely, if \Sigma defines a Mal'cev variety, then F_\Sigma weakly preserves kernel pairs. As a tool, we prove that arbitrary Set-endofunctors F weakly preserve kernel pairs if and only if they weakly preserve pullbacks of epis.
