For a commutative ring R with identity, a Specker R-algebra is a commutative unital R-algebra generated by a Boolean algebra of idempotents, each nonzero element of which is faithful. Such algebras have arisen in the study of \ell-groups, idempotent-generated rings, Boolean powers of commutative rings, Pierce duality, and rings of continuous real-valued functions. We trace the origin of this notion from early studies of subgroups of bounded integer-valued functions to a variety of current contexts involving ring-theoretic, topological, and homological aspects of idempotent-generated algebras.
