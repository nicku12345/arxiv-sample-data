We give necessary and sufficient conditions in order for the class of projectively coresolved Gorenstein flat modules, \mathcal{PGF}, (respectively that of projectively coresolved Gorenstein \mathcal{B} flat modules, \mathcal{PGF}_{\mathcal{B}}) to coincide with the class of Ding projective modules (\mathcal{DP}). We show that \mathcal{PGF} = \mathcal{DP} if and only if every Ding projective module is Gorenstein flat. This is the case if the ring R is coherent for example. We include an example to show that the coherence is a sufficient, but not a necessary condition in order to have \mathcal{PGF} = \mathcal{DP}. We also show that \mathcal{PGF} = \mathcal{DP} over any ring R of finite weak Gorenstein global dimension (this condition is also sufficient, but not necessary). We prove that if the class of Ding projective modules, \mathcal{DP}, is covering then the ring R is perfect. And we show that, over a coherent ring R, the converse also holds. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions in order to have \mathcal{PGF} = \mathcal{GP}, where \mathcal{GP} is the class of Gorenstein projective modules.
