Let A be any unital associative, possibly non-commutative ring and let p be a prime number. Let E(A) be the ring of p-typical Witt vectors as constructed by Cuntz and Deninger and W(A) be the abelian group constructed by Hesselholt. In arXiv:1708.04065 it was proved that if  p=2 and A is non commutative unital torsion free ring then there is no surjective continuous group homomorphism from W(A) \to HH_0(E(A)): = E(A)/\overline{[E(A),E(A)]} which commutes with the Verschiebung operator and the Teichm\"uller map. In this paper we generalise this result to all primes p and simplify the arguments used for p=2. We also prove that if A a is non-commutative unital ring then there is no continuous map of sets HH_0(E(A)) \to W(A) which commutes with the ghost maps.
