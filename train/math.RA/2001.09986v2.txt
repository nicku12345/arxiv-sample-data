Boolean calculus has been studied extensively in the past in the context of switching circuits, error-correcting codes etc. This work generalizes several approaches to defining a differential calculus for Boolean functions. A unified theory of Boolean calculus, complete with k-forms and integration, is presented through the use of Zhegalkin algebras (i.e., algebraic normal forms), culminating in a Stokes-like theorem for Boolean functions.
