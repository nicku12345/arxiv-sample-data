The purpose of this paper is to study the construction of 3-Bihom-Lie algebras. We give some ways of constructing 3-Bihom-Lie algebras from 3-Bihom-Lie algebras and 3-totally Bihom-associative algebras. Furthermore, we introduce T_\theta-extensions and T_\theta^*-extensions of 3-Bihom-Lie algebras and prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for a 2n-dimensional quadratic 3-Bihom-Lie algebra to be isomorphic to a T_\theta^*-extension.
