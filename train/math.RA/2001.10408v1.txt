The second cohomology group (SCG) of the Jordan superalgebra \mathcal{D}_{t}, t\neq 0, is calculated by using the coefficients which appear in the regular superbimodule \mathrm{Reg}\mathcal{D}_t. Contrary to the case of algebras, this group is nontrivial thanks to the non-splitting caused by the Wedderburn Decomposition Theorem \cite{Faber1}. First, to calculate the SCG of a Jordan superalgebra we use split-null extension of the Jordan superalgebra and the Jordan superalgebra representation. We prove conditions that satisfy the bilinear forms h that determine the SCG in Jordan superalgebras. We use these to calculate the SCG for the Jordan superalgebra \mathcal{D}_{t} , t\neq 0. Finally, we prove that \mathcal{H}^2(\mathcal{D}_{t}, \textrm{Reg}\mathcal{D}_{t})=0\oplus\mathbb{F}^2, t\neq 0.
