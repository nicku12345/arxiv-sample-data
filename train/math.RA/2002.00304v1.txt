Let \R be an alternative ring containing a nontrivial idempotent and \D be a multiplicative Lie-type derivation from \R into itself. Under certain assumptions on \R, we prove that \D is almost additive. Let p_n(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) be the (n-1)-th commutator defined by n indeterminates x_1, \cdots, x_n. If \R is a unital alternative ring with a nontrivial idempotent and is \{2,3,n-1,n-3\}-torsion free, it is shown under certain condition of \R and \D, that \D=\delta+\tau, where \delta is a derivation and \tau\colon\R\longrightarrow{\mathcal Z}(\R) such that \tau(p_n(a_1,\ldots,a_n))=0 for all a_1,\ldots,a_n\in\R.
