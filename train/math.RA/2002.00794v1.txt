In this paper, we give some construction about ternary Jordan algebras at first. Next we study relationships between generalized derivations, quasiderivations and centroids of ternary Jordan algebras. We show that for ternary Jordan algebras, generalized derivation algebras are the sum of quasiderivation algebras and centroids where centroids are ideals of generalized derivation algebras. We also prove that quasiderivations can be embedded into larger ternary Jordan algebras as derivations. In particular, we also determine dimensions of ternary Jordan algebras in the case of all linear transformations are quasiderivations. Some properties about centroids of ternary Jordan algebras are also displayed.
