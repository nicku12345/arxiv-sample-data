We study congruences on the partial automorphism monoid of a finite rank free group action. We give a decomposition of a congruence on this monoid into a Rees congruence, a congruence on a Brandt semigroup and an idempotent separating congruence. The constituent parts are further described in terms of subgroups of direct and semidirect products of groups. We utilize this description to demonstrate how the number of congruences on the partial automorphism monoid depends on the group and on the rank of the action.
