Let R be a ring with involution containing a nontrivial symmetric idempotent element e. Let \delta: R\rightarrow R be a mapping such that \delta(ab)=\delta(b)a^{\ast}+b^{\ast}\delta(a) for all a,b\in R, we call \delta a \ast-reverse derivable map on R. In this paper, our aim is to show that under some suitable restrictions imposed on R, every \ast-reverse derivable map of R is additive.
