For a field K, let \mathcal{R} denote the Jacobson algebra K\langle X, Y \ | \ XY=1\rangle. We give an explicit construction of the injective envelope of each of the (infinitely many) simple left \mathcal{R}-modules. Consequently, we obtain an explicit description of a minimal injective cogenerator for \mathcal{R}. Our approach involves realizing \mathcal{R} up to isomorphism as the Leavitt path K-algebra of an appropriate graph \mathcal{T}, which thereby allows us to utilize important machinery developed for that class of algebras.
