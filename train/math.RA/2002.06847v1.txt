We describe Morita equivalence of unital locally matrix algebras in terms of their Steinitz parametrization. Two countable dimensional unital locally matrix algebras are Morita equivalent if and only if their Steinitz numbers are rationally connected. For an arbitrary uncountable dimension \alpha and an arbitrary not locally finite Steinitz number s there exist unital locally matrix algebras A, B such that \dim_{F}A=\dim_{F}B=\alpha, \mathbf{st}(A)=\mathbf{st}(B)=s, however, the algebras A, B are not Morita equivalent.
