Let \mathbb K be a field of characteristic zero, A an integral domain over \mathbb K with the field of fractions R = \text{Frac}(A), and \text{Der}_{\mathbb{K}}A the Lie algebra of all \mathbb K-derivations on A.   Let W(A):=R\text{Der}_{\mathbb{K}} A and L a nilpotent subalgebra of rank n over R of the Lie algebra W(A). We prove that if the center Z=Z(L) is of rank \geq n-2 over R and F=F(L) is the field of constants for L in R, then the Lie algebra FL is contained in a locally nilpotent subalgebra of  W(A) of rank n over R with a natural basis over the field R. It is also also proved that the Lie algebra FL can be isomorphically embedded (as an abstract Lie algebra) into the triangular Lie algebra u_n(F) which was studied early by other authors.
