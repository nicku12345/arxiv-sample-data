We study the existence problem for Novikov algebra structures on finite-dimensional Lie algebras. We show that a Lie algebra admitting a Novikov algebra is necessarily solvable. Conversely we present a 2-step solvable Lie algebra without any Novikov structure. We use extensions and classical r-matrices to construct Novikov structures on certain classes of solvable Lie algebras.
