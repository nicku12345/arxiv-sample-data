Let \mathcal{T} be a triangular algebra over a commutative ring \mathcal{R} and \varphi: \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{T}\longrightarrow \mathcal{T} be an arbitrary Lie biderivation of \mathcal{T}. We will address the question of describing the form of \varphi in the current work. It is shown that under certain mild assumptions, \varphi is the sum of an inner biderivation and an extremal biderivation and a some central bilinear mapping. Our results is immediately applied to block upper triangular algebras and Hilbert space nest algebras .
