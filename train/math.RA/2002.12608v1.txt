Let R be a commutative ring with 1\neq0. In this paper, we introduce the concept of weakly 1-absorbing primary ideal which is a generalization of 1-absorbing ideal. A proper ideal I of R is called a weakly 1-absorbing primary ideal if whenever nonunit elements a,b,c\in R and 0\neq abc\in I, then ab\in I or c\in\sqrt{I}. A number of results concerning weakly 1-absorbing primary ideals and examples of weakly 1-absorbing primary ideals are given. Furthermore, we give the correct version of a result on 1-absorbing ideals of commutative rings.
