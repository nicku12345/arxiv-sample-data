Let p be a prime such that the multiplicative order m of 2 modulo p is even. We prove that the integral group ring \mathbb{Z}[Q_8 \times C_p] has the multiplicative Jordan decomposition property when m is congruent to 2 modulo 4. There are infinitely many such primes and these primes include the case p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}. We also prove that \mathbb{Z}[Q_8 \times C_5] has the multiplicative Jordan decomposition property in a new way.
