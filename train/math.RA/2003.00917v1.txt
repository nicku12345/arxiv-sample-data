In this paper, we first define the pre-Lie family algebra associated to a dendriform family algebra in the case of a commutative semigroup. Then we construct a pre-Lie family algebra via typed decorated rooted trees, and we prove the freeness of this pre-Lie family algebra. We also construct pre-Lie family operad in terms of typed labeled rooted trees, and we obtain that the operad of pre-Lie family algebras is isomorphic to the operad of typed labeled rooted trees, which generalizes the result of F. Chapoton and M. Livernet. In the end, we construct Zinbiel and pre-Poisson family algebras and generalize results of M. Aguiar.
