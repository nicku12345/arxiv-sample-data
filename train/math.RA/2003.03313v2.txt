An orthogonality space is a set equipped with a symmetric and irreflexive binary relation. We consider orthogonality spaces with the additional property that any collection of mutually orthogonal elements gives rise to the structure of a Boolean algebra. Together with the maps that preserve the Boolean structures, we are led to the category {\mathcal N}{\mathcal O}{\mathcal S} of normal orthogonality spaces. Moreover, an orthogonality space of finite rank is called linear if for any two distinct elements e and f there is a third one g such that exactly one of f and g is orthogonal to e and the pairs e, f and e, g have the same orthogonal complement. Linear orthogonality spaces arise from finite-dimensional Hermitian spaces. We are led to the full subcategory {\mathcal L}{\mathcal O}{\mathcal S} of {\mathcal N}{\mathcal O}{\mathcal S} and we show that the morphisms are the orthogonality-preserving lineations. Finally, we consider the full subcategory {\mathcal E}{\mathcal O}{\mathcal S} of {\mathcal L}{\mathcal O}{\mathcal S} whose members arise from positive definite Hermitian spaces over Baer ordered \star-fields with a Euclidean fixed field. We establish that the morphisms of {\mathcal E}{\mathcal O}{\mathcal S} are induced by generalised semiunitary mappings.
