Let \Re and \Re' unital 2,3-torsion free alternative rings and \varphi: \Re \rightarrow \Re' be a surjective Lie multiplicative map that preserves idempotents. Assume that \Re has a nontrivial idempotents. Under certain assumptions on \Re, we prove that \varphi is of the form \psi + \tau, where \psi is either an isomorphism or the negative of an anti-isomorphism of \Re onto \Re' and \tau is an additive mapping of \Re into the centre of \Re' which maps commutators into zero.
