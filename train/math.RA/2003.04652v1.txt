This paper concerns the problem of classifying finite-dimensional real solvable Lie algebras whose derived algebras are of codimension 1 or 2. On the one hand, we present an effective method to classify all (n+1)-dimensional real solvable Lie algebras having 1-codimensional derived algebras provided that a full classification of n-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras is given. On the other hand, the problem of classifying all (n+2)-dimensional real solvable Lie algebras having 2-codimensional derived algebras is proved to be wild. In this case, we provide a method to classify a subclass of the considered Lie algebras which are extended from their derived algebras by a pair of derivations containing at least one inner derivation.
