In this investigation, we give a module-theoretic counterpart of the well known Demorgan's laws for rings and topological spaces. We observed that the corresponding like Demorgan's laws on a module holds precisely when the module has a certain kind of structure. Besides the considerations of Demorgan's laws for ordered structures (idiomatic-quantales) the manuscript goes back to the ring theoretic realm, in this case, we study the non-commutative counterpart of Dedekind domains this consideration leads to the concept of Asano prime ring.
