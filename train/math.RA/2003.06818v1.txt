Let L_{n} be the free Lie algebra, F_{n} be the free metabelian Lie algebra, and L_{n,c} be the free metabelian nilpotent of class c Lie algebra of rank n generated by x_1,\ldots,x_n over a field K of characteristic zero. We call a polynomial p(X_n) symmetric in these Lie algebras if p(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=p(x_{\pi(1)},\ldots,x_{\pi(n)}) for each element \pi of the symmetric group S_n. The sets L_n^{S_n}, F_n^{S_n}, and L_{n,c}^{S_n} of symmetric polynomials coincide with the algebras of invariants of the group S_n in L_{n}, F_{n}, and L_{n,c}, respectively. We determine the groups \text{Inn}(F_{n}^{S_n}) and \text{Inn}(L_{n,c}^{S_n}) of inner automorphisms of the algebras F_{n}^{S_n} and L_{n,c}^{S_n}, respectively. In particular, we obtain the descriptions of the groups \text{Aut}(L_{2}^{S_2}), \text{Aut}(F_{2}^{S_2}), and \text{Aut}(L_{2,c}^{S_2}) of all automorphisms of the algebras L_{2}^{S_2}, F_{2}^{S_2}, and L_{2,c}^{S_2}, respectively.
