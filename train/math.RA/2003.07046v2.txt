In this paper, we introduce and study a cyclic cohomology theory H^\bullet_\lambda(A,C,\psi) for an entwining structure (A,C,\psi) over a field k. We then provide a complete description of the cocycles and the coboundaries in this theory using entwined traces applied to dg-entwining structures over (A,C,\psi). We then apply these descriptions to construct a pairing  H^m_\lambda(A,C,\psi) \otimes H^n_\lambda(A',C',\psi') \longrightarrow H^{m+n}_\lambda(A \otimes A', C \otimes C', \psi \otimes \psi') , where (A,C,\psi) and (A',C',\psi') are entwining structures.
