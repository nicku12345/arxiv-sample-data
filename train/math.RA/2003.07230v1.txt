In the present paper, which is a direct sequel of our papers [10,11,35] joint with Roozbeh Hazrat, we achieve a further dramatic reduction of the generating sets for commutators of relative elementary subgroups in Chevalley groups. Namely, let \Phi be a reduced irreducible root system of rank \ge 2, let R be a commutative ring and let A,B be two ideals of R. We consider subgroups of the Chevalley group G(\Phi,R) of type \Phi over R. The unrelative elementary subgroup E(\Phi,A) of level A is generated (as a group) by the elementary unipotents x_{\alpha}(a), \alpha\in\Phi, a\in A, of level A. Its normal closure in the absolute elementary subgroup E(\Phi,R) is denoted by E(\Phi,R,A) and is called the relative elementary subgroup of level A. The main results of [11,35] consisted in construction of economic generator sets for the mutual commutator subgroups [E(\Phi,R,A),E(\Phi,R,B)], where A and B are two ideals of R. It turned out that one can take Stein---Tits---Vaserstein generators of E(\Phi,R,AB), plus elementary commutators of the form y_{\alpha}(a,b)=[x_{\alpha}(a),x_{-\alpha}(b)], where a\in A, b\in B. Here we improve these results even further, by showing that in fact it suffices to engage only elementary commutators corresponding to {\it one\/} long root, and that modulo E(\Phi,R,AB) the commutators y_{\alpha}(a,b) behave as symbols. We discuss also some further variations and applications of these results.
