We consider a skew-symmetric n-ary bracket on the polynomial algebra K[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_{n+1}] (n\geq 2) over a field K of characteristic zero defined by \{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}=J(a_1,\ldots,a_n,C), where C is a fixed element of K[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_{n+1}] and J is the Jacobian. If n=2 then this bracket is a Poisson bracket and if n\geq 3 then it is an n-Lie-Poisson bracket on K[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_{n+1}]. We describe the center of the corresponding n-Lie-Poisson algebra and show that the quotient algebra K[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_{n+1}]/(C-\lambda), where (C-\lambda) is the ideal generated by C-\lambda, 0\neq \lambda \in K, is a simple central n-Lie-Poisson algebra if C is a homogeneous polynomial that is not a proper power of any nonzero polynomial. This construction includes the quotients P(\mathrm{sl}_2(K))/(C-\lambda) of the Poisson enveloping algebra P(\mathrm{sl}_2(K)) of the simple Lie algebra \mathrm{sl}_2(K), where C is the standard Casimir element of \mathrm{sl}_2(K) in P(\mathrm{sl}_2(K)). It is also proven that the quotients P(\mathbb{M})/(C-\lambda) of the Poisson enveloping algebra P(\mathbb{M}) of the exceptional simple seven dimensional Malcev algebra \mathbb{M} are central simple.
