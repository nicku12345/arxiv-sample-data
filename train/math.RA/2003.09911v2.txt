It is a conjecture that for the class of Leavitt path algebras associated to finite directed graphs, their graded Grothendieck groups K_0^{\mathrm{gr}} are a complete invariant. For a Leavitt path algebra L_{\mathsf k}(E), with coefficient in a field {\mathsf k}, the monoid of the positive cone of K_0^{\mathrm{gr}}(L_{\mathsf k}(E)) can be described completely in terms of the graph E. In this note we further investigate the structure of this "talented monoid", showing how it captures intrinsic properties of the graph and hence the structure of its associated Leavitt path algebras. In particular, for the class of strongly connected graphs, we show that the notion of the period of a graph can be completely described via the talented monoid. As an application, we will give a finer characterisation of the purely infinite simple Leavitt path algebras in terms of properties of the associated graph. We show that graded isomorphism of algebras preserve the period of the graphs, and obtain results giving more evidence to the graded classification conjecture.
