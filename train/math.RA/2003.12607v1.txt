Consider a Leibniz superalgebra \mathfrak L additionally graded by an arbitrary set I (set grading). We show that \mathfrak L decomposes as the sum of well-described graded ideals plus (maybe) a suitable linear subspace. In the case of {\mathfrak L} being of maximal length, the simplicity of {\mathfrak L} is also characterized in terms of connections.
