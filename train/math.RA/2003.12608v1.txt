Oscillator Lie algebras are the only non commutative solvable Lie algebras which carry a bi-invariant Lorentzian metric. In this paper, we determine all the Poisson structures, and in particular, all symmetric Leibniz algebra structures whose underlying Lie algebra is an oscillator Lie algebra. We give also all the symmetric Leibniz bialgebra structures whose underlying Lie bialgebra structure is a Lie bialgebra structure on an oscillator Lie algebra. We derive some geometric consequences on oscillator Lie groups.
