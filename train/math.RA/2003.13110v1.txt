Let L_n be the free metabelian Leibniz algebra generated by the set X_n=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\} over a field K of characteristic zero. This is the free algebra of rank n in the variety of solvable of class 2 Leibniz algebras. We call an element s(X_n)\in L_n symmetric if s(x_{\sigma(1)},\ldots,x_{\sigma(n)})=s(x_1,\ldots,x_n) for each permutation \sigma of \{1,\ldots,n\}. The set L_n^{S_n} of symmetric polynomials of L_n is the algebra of invariants of the symmetric group S_n. Let K[X_n] be the usual polynomial algebra with indeterminates from X_n. The description of the algebra K[X_n]^{S_n} is well known, and the algebra (L_n')^{S_n} in the commutator ideal L_n' is a right K[X_n]^{S_n}-module. We give explicit forms of elements of the K[X_n]^{S_n}-module (L_n')^{S_n}. Additionally, we determine the description of the group {\rm Inn}(L_{n}^{S_n}) of inner automorphisms of the algebra L_n^{S_n}. The findings can be considered as a generalization of the recent results obtained for the free metabelian Lie algebra of rank n.
