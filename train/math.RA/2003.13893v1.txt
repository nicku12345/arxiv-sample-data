In this paper, we prove that every invertible 2-local or local automorphism of a simple generalized Witt algebra over any field of characteristic 0 is an automorphism. In particular, every 2-local or local automorphism of Witt algebras W_n is an automorphism for all n\in \mathbb{N}. But some simple generalized Witt algebras indeed have 2-local (and local) automorphisms that are not automorphisms.
