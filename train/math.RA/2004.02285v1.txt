We determine the number of isomorphism classes of elementary gradings by a finite group on an algebra of upper block-triangular matrices. As a consequence we prove that, for a finite abelian group G, the sequence of the numbers E(G,m) of isomorphism classes of elementary G-gradings on the algebra M_{m}(\mathbb{F}) of m\times m matrices with entries in a field \mathbb{F} characterizes G. A formula for the number of isomorphism classes of gradings by a finite abelian group on an algebra of upper block-triangular matrices over an algebraically closed field, with mild restrictions on its characteristic, is also provided. Finally, if G is a finite abelian group, \mathbb{F} is an algebraically closed field and N(G,m) is the number of isomorphism classes of G-gradings on M_{m}% (\mathbb{F}) we prove that N(G,m)\sim\frac{1}{\left\vert G\right\vert !}m^{\left\vert G\right\vert -1}\sim E(G,m).
