For a finite group G and U: = U(\mathbb{Z}G), the group of units of the integral group ring of G, we study the implications of the structure of G on the abelianization U/U' of U. We pose questions on the connections between the exponent of G/G' and the exponent of U/U' as well as between the ranks of the torsion-free parts of Z(U), the center of U, and U/U'. We show that the units originating from known generic constructions of units in \mathbb{Z}G are well-behaved under the projection from U to U/U' and that our questions have a positive answer for many examples. We then exhibit an explicit example which shows that the general statement on the torsion-free part does not hold, which also answers questions from [BJJ^+18].
