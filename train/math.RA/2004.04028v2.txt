A set-theoretic solution of the Pentagon Equation on a non-empty set S is a map s\colon S^2\to S^2 such that s_{23}s_{13}s_{12}=s_{12}s_{23}, where s_{12}=s\times\mathrm{id}, s_{23}=\mathrm{id}\times s and s_{13}=(\tau\times\mathrm{id})(\mathrm{id}\times s)(\tau\times\mathrm{id}) are mappings from S^3 to itself and \tau\colon S^2\to S^2 is the flip map, i.e., \tau (x,y) =(y,x). We give a description of all involutive solutions, i.e., s^2=\mathrm{id}. It is shown that such solutions are determined by a factorization of S as direct product X\times A \times G and a map \sigma\colon A\to\mathrm{Sym}(X), where X is a non-empty set and A,G are elementary abelian 2-groups. Isomorphic solutions are determined by the cardinalities of A, G and X, i.e., the map \sigma is irrelevant. In particular, if S is finite of cardinality 2^n(2m+1) for some n,m\geq 0 then, on S, there are precisely \binom{n+2}{2} non-isomorphic solutions of the Pentagon Equation.
