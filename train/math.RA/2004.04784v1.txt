The index of a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} is defined by ind \mathfrak{g}= \min_{f\in \mathfrak{g}^*}\dim(\ker (B_f)), where f is an element of the linear dual \mathfrak{g}^* and B_f(x,y)=f([x,y]) is the associated skew-symmetric Kirillov form. We develop a broad general framework for the explicit construction of regular (index realizing) functionals for seaweed subalgebras of \mathfrak{gl}(n) and the classical Lie algebras: A_n=\mathfrak{sl}(n+1), B_n=\mathfrak{so}(2n+1), and C_n=\mathfrak{sp}(2n). Until now, this problem has remained open in \mathfrak{gl}(n) -- and in all the classical types.
