Let U be a Lie ideal of a 2-torsion free prime \Gamma -ring M such that u\alpha u\in U for all u\in U and \alpha \in\Gamma . If T:M\rightarrow M is an additive mapping satifying the relation T(u\alpha u)=T(u)\alpha u for all u\in U and \alpha \in\Gamma , then we prove that T(u\alpha v)=T(u)\alpha v for all u, v\in U and \alpha \in\Gamma . Also this result is extended to semiprime \Gamma -rings.
