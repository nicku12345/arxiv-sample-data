In this note we connect finite presentability of a Jordan algebra to finite presentability of its Tits-Kantor-Koecher algebra. Through this we complete our discussion of finite presentability of universal central extensions of {\mathfrak{sl}_n(A)}, A a k-algebra, initiated in our previous paper, and answer a question raised by Shestakov-Zelmanov in the positive.
