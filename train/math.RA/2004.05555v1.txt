For a skew left brace (G, \cdot, \circ), the map \lambda : (G, \circ) \to \mathrm{Aut} \;(G, \cdot),~~a \mapsto \lambda_a, where \lambda_a(b) = a^{-1} \cdot (a \circ b) for all a, b \in G, is a group homomorphism. Then \lambda can also be viewed as a map from (G, \cdot) to \mathrm{Aut}\; (G, \cdot), which, in general, may not be a homomorphism. We study skew left braces (G, \cdot, \circ) for which \lambda : (G, \cdot) \to \mathrm{Aut}\; (G, \cdot) is a homomorphism. Such skew left braces will be called \lambda-homomorphic. We formulate necessary and sufficient conditions under which a given homomorphism \lambda : (G, \cdot) \to \mathrm{Aut}\; (G, \cdot) gives rise to a skew left brace, which, indeed, is \lambda-homomorphic. As an application, we construct skew left braces when (G, \cdot) is either a free group or a free abelian group. We prove that any \lambda-homomorphic skew left brace is an extension of a trivial skew brace by a trivial skew brace. Special emphasis is given on \lambda-homomorphic skew left brace for which the image of \lambda is cyclic. A complete characterization of such skew left braces on the free abelian group of rank two is obtained.
