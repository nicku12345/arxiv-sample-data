In the present paper, we study the notion of the Schur multiplier \mathcal{M}(L) of an n-Lie superalgebra L, and prove that \dim \mathcal{M}(L) \leq \sum_{i=0}^{n} {m\choose{i}} \mathcal{L}(n-i,k), where \dim L=(m|k), \mathcal{L}(0,k)=1 and \mathcal{L}(t,k) = \sum_{j=1}^{t}{{t-1}\choose{j-1}} {k\choose j}, for 1\leq t\leq n. Moreover, we obtain an upper bound for the dimension of \mathcal{M}(L) in which L is a nilpotent n-Lie superalgebra with one-dimensional derived superalgebra. It is also provided several inequalities on \dim\mathcal{M}(L) as well as an n-Lie superalgebra analogue of the converse of Schur's theorem.
