We prove that every Jordan left centralizer over matrix ring is a left centralizer and establish that every additive mapping T on M_r(R) satisfying 2T(x^2)=T(x)x+xT(x), for all x\in M_r(R) is of a particular form T(x)=\alpha x, for all x\in M_r(R), where \alpha is in the center of the ring R. In the successive results, it is shown that additive mappings over matrix rings satisfying certain conditions becomes a two-sided centralizer and has the same form as mentioned above.
