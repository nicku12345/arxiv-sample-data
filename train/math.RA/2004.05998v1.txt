The main goal of this paper is to introduce the notion of 3-L-dendriform algebras which are the dendriform version of 3-pre-Lie algebras. In fact they are the algebraic structures behind the \mathcal{O}-operator of 3-pre-Lie algebras. They can be also regarded as the ternary analogous of L-dendriform algebras. Moreover, we study the generalized derivations of 3-L-dendriform algebras. Finally, we explore the spaces of quasi-derivations, the centroids and the quasi-centroids and give some properties.
