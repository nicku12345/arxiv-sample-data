The aim of this paper is to generalise the construction of 3-Bihom-Lie superalgebras and we provide some properties can be lifted to its T^{\ast}-extensions such as nilpotency, solvability and decomposition. We study the representations, T_{\theta}-extensions and T^{\ast}_{\theta}-extension of 3-Bihom-Lie superalgebras and prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for a 2n-dimensional quadratic 3-Bihom-Lie superalgebra to be isomorphic to a T^{\ast}_{\theta}-extension.
