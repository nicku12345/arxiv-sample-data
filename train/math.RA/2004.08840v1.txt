We investigate the lattice of clones that are generated by a set of functions that are induced on a finite field \mathbb{F} by monomials. We study the atoms and coatoms of this lattice and investigate whether this lattice contains infinite ascending chains, or infinite descending chains, or infinite antichains. We give a full characterization of the lattice of these clones if the field is of order 2^k=p+1 where p is a prime and k\in\mathbb{N}. Furthermore, we show that the sublattice of idempotent clones of this lattice is finite and every idempotent monomial clone is principal.
