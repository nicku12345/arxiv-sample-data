Let R be an associative ring with unity 1 and consider k\in \mathbb{N} such that 1+1+..+1=k is invertible. Denote by \omega an arbitrary kth root of unity in R and let UT^{(k)}_{\infty}(R) be the group of upper triangular infinite matrices whose diagonal entries are kth roots of 1. We show that every element of the group UT_{\infty}(R) can be expressed as a product of 4k-6 commutators all depending of powers of elements in UT^{(k)}_{\infty}(R) of order k. If R is the complex field or the real number field we prove that, in SL_n(R) and in the subgroup SL_{VK}(\infty,R) of the Vershik-Kerov group over R, each element in these groups can be decomposed into a product of at most 4k-6 commutators of elements of order k.
