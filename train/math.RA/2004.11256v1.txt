We extend recent results in order to construct projective resolutions for modules over twisted tensor products of truncated polynomial rings. We begin by taking note of the conditions necessary to think of these algebras as a type of Ore extension. We then use this parallel with Ore extensions to develop a method for constructing projective resolutions. Finally we use the new construction to compute a resolution for a family of examples.
