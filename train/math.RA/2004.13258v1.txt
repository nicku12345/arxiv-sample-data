We introduce a theory of cyclic Kummer extensions of commutative rings for partial Galois extensions of finite groups, extending some of the well-known results of the theory of Kummer extensions of commutative rings developed by A. Z. Borevich. In particular, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions to determine when a partial n-kummerian extension is equivalent to either a radical or a I-radical extension, for some subgroup I of the cyclic group C_n.
