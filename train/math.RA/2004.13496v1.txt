In this paper, we extend notions of the weighted core-EP right and left inverses, the weighted DMP and MPD inverses, and the CMP inverse to matrices over the quaternion skew field H that have some features in comparison to these inverses over the complex field. We give the direct methods of their computing, namely, their determinantal representations by using noncommutative column and row determinants previously introduced by the author. As the special cases, by using the usual determinant, we give their determinantal representations for matrices with complex entries as well. A numerical example to illustrate the main result is given.
