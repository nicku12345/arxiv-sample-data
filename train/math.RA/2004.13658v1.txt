In this article, we study the notion of central extension of Leibniz n-algebras relative to n-Lie algebras to study properties of Schur \mathsf{Lie}-multiplier and \mathsf{Lie}-covers on Leibniz n-algebras. We provide a characterization of \mathsf{Lie}-perfect Leibniz n-algebras by means of universal \mathsf{Lie}-central extensions. It is also provided some inequalities on the dimension of the Schur \mathsf{Lie}-multiplier of Leibniz n-algebras. Analogue to Wiegold [38] and Green [17] results on groups or Moneyhun [26] result on Lie algebras, we provide upper bounds for the dimension of the \mathsf{Lie}-commutator of a Leibniz n-algebra with finite dimensional \mathsf{Lie}-central factor, and also for the dimension of the Schur \mathsf{Lie}-multiplier of a finite dimensional Leibniz n-algebra.
