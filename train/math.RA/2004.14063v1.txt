In this paper, we introduce \phi-\delta-primary elements in a compactly generated multiplicative lattice L and obtain its characterizations. We prove many of its properties and investigate the relations between these structures. By a counter example, it is shown that a \phi-\delta-primary element of L need not be \delta-primary and found conditions under which a \phi-\delta-primary element of L is \delta-primary.
