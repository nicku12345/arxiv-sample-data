Let \Lambda be an artin algebra. We give an upper bound for the dimension of the bounded derived category of the category \mod \Lambda of finitely generated right \Lambda-modules in terms of the projective and injective dimensions of certain class of simple right \Lambda-modules as well as the radical layer length of \Lambda. In addition, we give an upper bound for the dimension of the singularity category of \mod \Lambda in terms of the radical layer length of \Lambda.
