Suppose \mathfrak{R} is a 2,3-torsion free unital alternative ring having an idempotent element e_1 \left(e_2 = 1-e_1\right) which satisfies x \mathfrak{R} \cdot e_i = \{0\} \rightarrow x = 0 \left(i = 1,2\right). In this paper, we aim to characterize the commuting maps. Let \varphi be a commuting map of \mathfrak{R} so it is shown that \varphi(x) = zx + \Xi(x) for all x \in \mathfrak{R}, where z \in \mathcal{Z}(\mathfrak{R}) and \Xi is an additive map from \mathfrak{R} into \mathcal{Z}(\mathfrak{R}). As a consequence a characterization of anti-commuting maps is obtained and we provide as an application, a characterization of commuting maps on von Neumann algebras relative alternative C^{*}-algebra with no central summands of type I_1.
