We study sums of k-potent matrices. We show the conditions by which a complex matrix A can be expressed as a sums of k-potent matrices. Also we obtain conditions by which a complex matrix A can be expressed as a sum of finite order elements. This generalize some results obtain by Wu. Also we study the sum of k-potent matrices in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}f}(F) with F be a field and proof that any matrix in this space can be expressed as a sum of 14 (k+1)-potent matrices preserving the result obtain by Slowik.
