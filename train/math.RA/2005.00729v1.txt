In this paper, we introduce the cohomology theory of relative Rota-Baxter operators on Leibniz algebras. We use the cohomological approach to study linear and formal deformations of relative Rota-Baxter operators. In particular, the notion of Nijenhuis elements is introduced to characterize trivial linear deformations. Formal deformations and extendibility of order n deformations of a relative Rota-Baxter operator are also characterized in terms of the cohomology theory.
