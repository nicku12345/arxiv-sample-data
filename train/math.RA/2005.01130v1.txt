The notion of the weighted core inverse in a ring with involution was introduced, recently [Mosic et al. Comm. Algebra, 2018; 46(6); 2332-2345]. In this paper, we explore new representation and characterization of the weighted core inverse of sum and difference of two weighted core invertible elements in an unital ring with involution under different conditions. Further, we discuss reverse order laws and mixed-type reverse order laws for the weighted core invertible elements in a ring.
