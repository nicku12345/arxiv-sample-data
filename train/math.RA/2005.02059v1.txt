Let R be a ring. It is proved that an R-module M is Baer (resp. dual Baer) if and only if every exact sequence 0\rightarrow X\rightarrow M\rightarrow Y\rightarrow 0 with Y\in Cog(M_R) (resp. X\in Gen(M_R)) splits. This shows that being (dual) Baer is a Morita invariant property. As more applications, the Baer condition for the R-module M^+  = Hom_{\Bbb Z}(M,{\Bbb Q}/{\Bbb Z}) is investigated and shown that R is a von Neumann regular ring, if R^+ is a Baer R-module. Baer modules with (weak) chain conditions are studied and determined when a Baer (resp. dual baer) module   is a direct sum of mutually orthogonal prime (resp. co-prime) modules. Finitely generated dual Baer modules over commutative rings are studeid
