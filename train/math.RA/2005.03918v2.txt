Let S be a 3-dimensional quantum polynomial algebra, and f \in S_2 a central regular element. The quotient algebra A = S/(f) is called a noncommutative conic. For a noncommutative conic A, there is a finite dimensional algebra C(A) which determines the singularity of A. In this paper, we mainly focus on a noncommutative conic such that its quadratic dual is commutative, which is equivalent to say, S is determined by a symmetric regular superpotential. We classify these noncommutative conics up to isomorphism of the pairs (S,f), and calculate the algebras C(A).
