We introduce an isomorphism test for structures having a distributive type property, such as tensors, rings, and nilpotent groups. The test applies a universal construction to generalize several existing isomorphism tests, recovering these as special cases. Whereas earlier methods exploit associative algebras and their representations, the new approach is based on Lie algebras, leading to polynomial-time isomorphism tests for new families.
