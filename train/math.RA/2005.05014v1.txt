Let F be a finite field of characteristic p. The structures of the unit groups of group algebras over F of the three groups D_{24}, S_4 and SL(2, \mathbb{Z}_3) of order 24 are completely described in \cite{K4, SM, SM1, FM, sh1}. In this paper, we give the unit groups of the group algebras over F of the remaining groups of order 24, namely, C_{24}, C_{12} \times C_2, C_2^3 \times C_3, C_3 \rtimes C_8, C_3 \rtimes Q_8, D_6 \times C_4, C_6 \rtimes C_4, C_3 \rtimes D_8, C_3 \times D_8, C_3 \times Q_8, A_4 \times C_2 and D_{12} \times C_2.
