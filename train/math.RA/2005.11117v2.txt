The purpose of this paper is to determine skew-symmetric biderivations \text{Bider}_{\text{s}}(L, V) and commuting linear maps \text{Com}(L, V) on a Hom-Lie algebra (L,\alpha) having their ranges in an (L,\alpha)-module (V, \rho, \beta), which are both closely related to \text{Cent} (L, V), the centroid of (V, \rho, \beta). Specifically, under appropriate assumptions, every \delta\in\text{Bider}_{\text{s}}(L, V) is of the form \delta(x,y)=\beta^{-1}\gamma([x,y]) for some \gamma\in \text{Cent} (L, V), and \text{Com}(L, V) coincides with \text{Cent} (L, V). Besides, we give the algorithm for describing \text{Bider}_{\text{s}}(L, V) and \text{Com}(L, V) respectively, and provide several examples.
