We introduce the notion of right pre-resolutions (quasi-resolutions) for noncommutative isolated singularities, which is a weaker version of quasi-resolutions introduced by Qin-Wang-Zhang. We prove that right quasi-resolutions for noetherian bounded below and locally finite graded algebra with right injective dimension 2 are always Morita equivalent. When we restrict to noncommutative quadric hypersurfaces, we prove that a noncommutative quadric hypersurface, which is a noncommutative isolated singularity, always admits a right pre-resolution. Besides, we provide a method to verify whether a noncommutative quadric hypersurface is an isolated singularity. An example of noncommutative quadric hypersurfaces with detailed computations of indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules and right pre-resolutions is included as well.
