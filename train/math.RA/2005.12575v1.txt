In this paper, we introduce a new class of rings whose elements are a sum of a central element and a nilpotent element, namely, a ring R is calledCN if each element a of R has a decomposition a = c + n where c is central and n is nilpotent. In this note, we characterize elements in M_n(R) and U_2(R) having CN-decompositions. For any field F, we give examples to show that M_n(F) can not be a CN-ring. For a division ring D, we prove that if M_n(D) is a CN-ring, then the cardinality of the center of D is strictly greater than n. Especially, we investigate several kinds of conditions under which some subrings of full matrix rings over CN rings are CN.
