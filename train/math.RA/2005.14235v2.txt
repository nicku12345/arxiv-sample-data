Let \Gamma be the infinite cyclic group on a generator x. To avoid confusion when working with \mathbb Z-modules which also have an additional \mathbb Z-action, we consider the \mathbb Z-action to be a \Gamma-action instead.   Starting from a directed graph E, one can define a cancellative commutative monoid M_E^\Gamma with a \Gamma-action which agrees with the monoid structure and a natural order. The order and the action enable one to label each nonzero element as being exactly one of the following: comparable (periodic or aperiodic) or incomparable. We comprehensively pair up these element features with the graph-theoretic properties of the generators of the element. We also characterize graphs such that every element of M_E^\Gamma is comparable, periodic, graphs such that every nonzero element of M_E^\Gamma is aperiodic, incomparable, graphs such that no nonzero element of M_E^\Gamma is periodic, and graphs such that no element of M_E^\Gamma is aperiodic.   The Graded Classification Conjecture can be formulated to state that M_E^\Gamma is a complete invariant of the Leavitt path algebra L_K(E) of E over a field K. Our characterizations indicate that the Graded Classification Conjecture may have a positive answer since the properties of E are well reflected by the structure of M_E^\Gamma. Our work also implies that some results of [R. Hazrat, H. Li, The talented monoid of a Leavitt path algebra, J. Algebra, 547 (2020) 430-455] hold without requiring the graph to be row-finite.
