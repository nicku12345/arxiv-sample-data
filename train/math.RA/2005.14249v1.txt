Hom-dendriform algebras are twisted analog of dendriform algebras and are splitting of hom-associative algebras. In this paper, we define a cohomology and deformation for hom-dendriform algebras. We relate this cohomology with the Hochschild-type cohomology of hom-associative algebras. We also describe similar results for the twisted analog of dendriform coalgebras.
