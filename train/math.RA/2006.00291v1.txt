We investigate finitary functions from \mathbb{Z}_{pq} to \mathbb{Z}_{pq} for two distinct prime numbers p and q. We show that the lattice of all clones on the set \mathbb{Z}_{pq} which contain the addition of \mathbb{Z}_{pq} is finite. We provide an upper bound for the cardinality of this lattice through an injective function to the direct product of the lattice of all (\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q)-linearly closed clonoids to the p+1 power and the lattice of all (\mathbb{Z}_q,\mathbb{Z}_p)-linearly closed clonoids to the q+1 power. These lattices are studied in arXiv:1910.11759 and there we can find the exact cardinality of them. Furthermore, we prove that these clones can be generated by a set of functions of arity at most max(\{p,q\}).
