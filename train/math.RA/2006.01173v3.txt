We investigate Mal'cev conditions described by equations whose variables runs over the set of all compatible reflexive relations. Let p \leq q be an equation in the language \{\wedge, \circ,+\}. We give a characterization of the class of all varieties which satisfy p \leq q over the set of all compatible reflexive relations. The aim is to find an analogon of the Pixley-Wille algorithm for conditions expressed by equations over the set of all compatible reflexive relations, and to characterize when an equation p \leq q expresses the same property when considered over the congruence lattices or over the sets of all compatible reflexive relations of algebras in a variety.
