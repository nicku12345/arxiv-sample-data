We prove that the spectrum of every Rota-Baxter operator of weight \lambda on a unital algebraic (not necessarily associative) algebra over a field of characteristic zero is a subset of \{0,-\lambda\}. For a finite-dimensional unital algebra the same statement is shown to hold without a restriction on the characteristic of the ground field. Based on these results, we define the Rota-Baxter \lambda-index \mathrm{rb}_\lambda(A) of an algebra A as the infimum of the degrees of minimal polynomials of all Rota-Baxter operators of weight \lambda on A. We calculate the Rota-Baxter \lambda-index for the matrix algebra M_n(F), \mathrm{char}\,F = 0: it is shown that \mathrm{rb}_\lambda(M_n(F)) = 2n-1.
