Let P be a Poisson algebra with a Lie bracket \{, \} over a field \F of characteristic p\geq 0. In this paper, the Lie structure of P is investigated. In particular, if P is solvable with respect to its Lie bracket, then we prove that the Poisson ideal \mathcal{J} of P generated by all elements \{\{\{x_1, x_2\}, \{x_3, x_4\}\}, x_5\} with x_1,\ldots ,x_5 \in P is associative nilpotent of index bounded by a function of the derived length of P. We use this result to further prove that if P is solvable and p\neq 2, then the Poisson ideal \{P,P\}P is nil.
