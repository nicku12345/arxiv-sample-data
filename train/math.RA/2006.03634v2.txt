We prove algebraic versions of recent results, proved by Brown, Fuller, Pitts, and Reznikoff, regarding regular and gauge-invariant ideals of graph C*-algebras. Precisely, for Leavitt path algebras of row-finite graphs, we describe the vertex set of a regular graded ideal. We show that for row finite graphs that satisfy Condition~(L), a regular ideal of the associated Leavitt path algebra is also graded. As a consequence we obtain the the quotient of the algebra by such an ideal is again a Leavitt path algebra. Finally, we show that for row-finite graphs, Condition~(L) is preserved by quotients by regular graded ideals.
