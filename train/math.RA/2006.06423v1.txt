In this paper, we show that a unital simple Steinberg algebra is central, and a nonunital simple Steinberg algebra has zero center. We identify the fields K and Hausdorff ample groupoids \mathcal{G} for which the simple Steinberg algebra A_K(\mathcal{G}) yields a simple Lie algebra [A_K(\mathcal{G}), A_K(\mathcal{G})]. We apply the obtained results on simple Leavitt path algebras, simple Kumjian-Pask algebras and simple Exel-Pardo algebras to determine their associated Lie algebras are simple. In particular, we give easily computable criteria to determine which Lie algebras of the form [L_K(E), L_K(E)] are simple, when E is an arbitrary graph and the Leavitt path algebra L_K(E) is simple. Also, we obtain that unital simple Exel-Pardo algebras are central, and nonunital simple Exel-Pardo algebras have zero center.
