If A is a ring with automorphism \varphi and the skew Laurent series ring A((x,\varphi )) is a right semidistributive semilocal ring then A is a right semidistributive right Artinian ring. The Laurent series ring A((x)) is a right semidistributive semilocal ring if and only if A is a right semidistributive right Artinian ring.   The study is supported by Russian Scientific Foundation (project 16-11-10013).
