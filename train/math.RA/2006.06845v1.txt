We show that the modular term condition higher commutator is equal to the modular hypercommutator. As a consequence, we arrive at a new proof that HC8 holds for modular varieties. Next, we develop a procedure for a modular variety for producing the higher dimensional congruences that characterize the hypercommutator. This procedure allows us to demonstrate that every modular variety has an infinite sequence of what we call higher dimensional Kiss terms. We use these results to extend the scope of a theorem of Opr\v{s}al from permutable varieties to modular varieties.
