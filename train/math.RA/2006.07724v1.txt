In this paper, we determine the relative rank of the semigroup T(X,Y) of all transformations on a finite chain X with restricted range Y \subseteq X modulo the set OP(X,Y) of all orientation-preserving transformation in T(X,Y). Moreover, we state the relative rank of the semigroup OP(X,Y) modulo the set O(X,Y) of all order-preserving transformations in OP(X,Y). In both cases we characterize the minimal relative generating sets.
