Under the assumption that a residually finite dimensional Hopf algebra H has an Artinian ring of fractions it is proved that H is a flat module over any right coideal subalgebra satisfying a polynomial identity and is faithfully flat over any polynomial identity Hopf subalgebra. As a consequence we find a large class of Hopf algebras which are flat over all coideal subalgebras and are faithfully flat over all Hopf subalgebras.
