Let F be a field of characteristic zero. We prove that if a group grading on UT_m(F) admits a graded involution then this grading is a coarsening of a \mathbb{Z}^{\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\rfloor}-grading on UT_m(F) and the graded involution is equivalent to the reflection or symplectic involution on UT_m(F). A finite basis for the (\mathbb{Z}^{\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\rfloor},\ast)-identities is exhibited for the reflection and symplectic involutions and the asymptotic growth of the (\mathbb{Z}^{\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\rfloor},\ast)-codimensions is determined. As a consequence we prove that for any G-grading on UT_m(F) and any graded involution the (G,\ast)-exponent is m if m is even and either m or m+1 if m is odd. For the algebra UT_3(F) there are, up to equivalence, two non-trivial gradings that admit a graded involution: the canonical \mathbb{Z}-grading and the \mathbb{Z}_2-grading induced by (0,1,0). We determine a basis for the (\mathbb{Z}_2,\ast)-identities and prove that the exponent is 3. Hence we conclude that the ordinary \ast-exponent for UT_3(F) is 3.
