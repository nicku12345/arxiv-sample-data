For an ample groupoid \mathcal{G} and a unit x of \mathcal{G}, Steinberg constructed the induction and restriction functors between the category of modules over the Steinberg algebra A_R(\mathcal{G}) and the category of modules over the isotropy group algebra R\mathcal{G}_x. In this paper, we prove a graded version of these functors and related results for the graded Steinberg algebra of a graded ample groupoid. As an application, the spectral simple and graded simple modules over the Leavitt path algebra L_K(E) are classified. In particular, we show that many of previously known simple and graded simple L_K(E)-modules, including the Chen simple modules, are induced from (graded or non-graded) simple modules over isotropy group algebras.
