We construct a family of unital non-associative algebras \{T_\alpha\vert~ 2<\alpha\in\mathbb R\} such that \underline{exp}(T_\alpha)=2, whereas \alpha\le\overline{exp}(T_\alpha)\le\alpha+1. In particular, it follows that ordinary PI-exponent of codimension growth of algebra T_\alpha does not exist for any \alpha> 2. This is the first example of a unital algebra whose PI-exponent does not exist.
