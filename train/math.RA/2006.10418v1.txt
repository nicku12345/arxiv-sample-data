Let D be a finite-dimensional division algebra over its center and R=D[t;\sigma,\delta] a skew polynomial ring. Under certain assumptions on \delta and \sigma, the ring of central quotients D(t;\sigma,\delta) = \{f/g \,|\, f \in D[t;\sigma,\delta], g \in C(D[t;\sigma,\delta])\} of D[t;\sigma,\delta] is a central simple algebra with reduced norm N. We calculate the norm N(f) for some skew polynomials f\in R and investigate when and how the reducibility of N(f) reflects the reducibility of f.
