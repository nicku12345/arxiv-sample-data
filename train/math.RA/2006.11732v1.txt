Along this paper we show that under certain conditions the method for describing of solvable Lie and Leibniz algebras with maximal codimension of nilradical is also extensible to Lie and Leibniz superalgebras, respectively. In particular, we totally determine the solvable Lie and Leibniz superalgebras with maximal codimension of model filiform and model nilpotent nilradicals. Finally, it is established that the superderivations of the obtained superalgebras are inner.
