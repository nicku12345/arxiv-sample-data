Generalized inverses of tensors play increasingly important roles in computational mathematics and numerical analysis. It is appropriate to develop the theory of generalized inverses of tensors within the algebraic structure of a ring. In this paper, we study different generalized inverses of tensors over a commutative ring and a non-commutative ring. Several numerical examples are provided in support of the theoretical results. We also propose algorithms for computing the inner inverses, the Moore-Penrose inverse, and weighted Moore-Penrose inverse of tensors over a non-commutative ring. The prowess of some of the results is demonstrated by applying these ideas to solve an image deblurring problem.
