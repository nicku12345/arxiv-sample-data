Leibniz algebras are certain generalizations of Lie algebras. Motivated by the concept of subinvariance in group theory, Schenkman studied properties of subinvariant subalgebras of a Lie algebra. In this paper we define subinvariant subalgebras of Leibniz algebras and study their properties. It is shown that the signature results on subinvariance in Lie algebras have analogs for Leibniz algebras.
