In this paper we introduce the notion of evolution rank and give a decomposition of an evolution algebra into its annihilator plus extending evolution subspaces having evolution rank one. This decomposition can be used to prove that in non-degenerate evolution algebras, any family of natural and orthogonal vectors can be extended to a natural basis. Central results are the characterization of those families of orthogonal linearly independent vectors which can be extended to a natural basis.   We also consider ideals in perfect evolution algebras and prove that they coincide with the basic ideals.   Nilpotent elements of order three can be localized (in a perfect evolution algebra over a field in which every element is a square) by merely looking at the structure matrix: any vanishing principal minor provides one. Conversely, if a perfect evolution algebra over an arbitrary field has a nilpotent element of order three, then its structure matrix has a vanishing principal minor.   We finish by considering the adjoint evolution algebra and relating its properties to the corresponding in the initial evolution algebra.
