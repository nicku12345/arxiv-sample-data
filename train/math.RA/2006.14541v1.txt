Let \mathbb{K} be a field of characteristic zero and B=B_0+B_1 a finite dimensional associative superalgebra. In this paper we investigate the polynomial identities of the relatively free algebras of finite rank of the variety \mathfrak V defined by the Grassmann envelope of B. We also consider the k-th Grassmann Envelope of B, G^{(k)}(B), constructed with the k-generated Grassmann algebra, instead of the infinite dimensional Grassmann algebra. We specialize our studies for the algebra UT_2(G) and UT_2(G^{(k)}), which can be seen as the Grassmann envelope and k-th Grassmann envelope, respectively, of the superalgebra UT_2(\mathbb{K}[u]), where u^2=1.
