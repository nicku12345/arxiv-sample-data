We provide a nontrivial bound on the rank of any tensor T over the quaternions \mathbb{H} in the n_1\times n_2\times n_3 cases where 2\leq n_i\leq 3. We describe a decomposition of T into 3 simple tensors in the 2\times 2\times 2 case. We also show that the upper bound is the best possible for some of the cases, and we provide various partial results involving tensor decompositions over \mathbb{C} and \mathbb{H}.
