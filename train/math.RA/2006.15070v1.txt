Let A_1,\ldots,A_s be unitary commutative rings which do not have non-trivial idempotents and let A=A_1\oplus\cdots\oplus A_s be their direct sum. We describe all idempotents in the 2\times 2 matrix ring M_2(A[[X]]) over the ring A[[X]] of formal power series with coefficients in A and in arbitrary set of variables X. We apply this result to the matrix ring M_2({\mathbb Z}_n[[X]]) over the ring {\mathbb Z}_n[[X]] for an arbitrary positive integer n greater than 1. Our proof is elementary and uses only the Cayley-Hamilton theorem (for 2\times 2 matrices only) and, in the special case A={\mathbb Z}_n, the Chinese reminder theorem and the Euler-Fermat theorem.
