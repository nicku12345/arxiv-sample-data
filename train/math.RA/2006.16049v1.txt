The aim of this paper is introduce and give some constructions results and examples of n-BiHom-Lie color algebras. Next, we introduce the definition of BiHom-modules over n- BiHom-Lie color algebras and we provide some properties. Moreover we investigate generalized derivations of n-BiHom-Lie color algebras and their BiHom-subalgebras.
