We give a geometric classification of complex 4-dimensional nilpotent \mathfrak{CD}-algebras. The corresponding geometric variety has dimension 18 and decomposes into 2 irreducible components determined by the Zariski closures of a two-parameter family of algebras and a four-parameter family of algebras (see Theorem 2). In particular, there are no rigid 4-dimensional complex nilpotent \mathfrak{CD}-algebras.
