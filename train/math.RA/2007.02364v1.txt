A new generalized inverse for a square matrix H\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}, called CCE-inverse, is established by the core-EP decomposition and Moore-Penrose inverse H^{\dag}. We propose some characterizations of the CCE-inverse. Furthermore, two canonical forms of the CCE-inverse are presented. At last, we introduce the definitions of CCE-matrices and k-CCE matrices, and prove that CCE-matrices are the same as i-EP matrices studied by Wang and Liu in [The weak group matrix, Aequationes Mathematicae, 93(6): 1261-1273, 2019].
