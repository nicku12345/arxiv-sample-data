Rehren proved that a primitive 2-generated axial algebra of Monster type (\alpha,\beta) has dimension at most eight if \alpha\notin\{2\beta,4\beta\}. In this note we construct an infinite-dimensional 2-generated primitive axial algebra of Monster type (2,\frac{1}{2}) over an arbitrary field F with char(F)\neq 2,3. This shows that the second special case, \alpha=4\beta, is a true exception to Rehren's bound.
