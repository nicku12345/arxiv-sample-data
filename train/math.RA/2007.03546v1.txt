The kernel relation K on the lattice \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{CR}) of varieties of completely regular semigroups has been a central component in many investigations into the structure of \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{CR}). However, apart from the K-class of the trivial variety, which is just the lattice of varieties of bands, the detailed structure of kernel classes has remained a mystery until recently. Kad'ourek [RK2] has shown that for two large classes of subvarieties of \mathcal{CR} their kernel classes are singletons. Elsewhere (see [RK1], [RK2], [RK3]) we have provided a detailed analysis of the kernel classes of varieties of abelian groups. Here we study more general kernel classes. We begin with a careful development of the concept of duality in the lattice of varieties of completely regular semigroups and then show that the kernel classes of many varieties, including many self-dual varieties, of completely regular semigroups contain multiple copies of the lattice of varieties of bands as sublattices.
