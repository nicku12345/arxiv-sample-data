Let \mathbb{F} be a field of characteristic p, and let UT_n(\mathbb{F}) be the algebra of n \times n upper triangular matrices over \mathbb{F} with an involution of the first kind. In this paper we describe: the set of all *-central polynomials for UT_n(\mathbb{F}) when n\geq 3 and p\neq 2 ; the set of all *-polynomial identities for UT_3(\mathbb{F}) when \mathbb{F} is infinite and p>2.
