In this paper, we study Dorroh extensions of bialgebras and Hopf algebras. Let (H,I) be both a Dorroh pair of algebras and a Dorroh pair of coalgebras. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for H\ltimes_dI to be a bialgebra and a Hopf algebra, respectively. We also describe all ideals of Dorroh extensions of algebras and subcoalgebras of Dorroh extensions of coalgebras and compute these ideals and subcoalgebras for some concrete examples.
