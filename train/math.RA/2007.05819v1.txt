Let FG be the group algebra of a finite 2-group G over a finite field F of characteristic two and \circledast an involution which arises from G. The \circledast-unitary subgroup of FG, denoted by V_{\circledast}(FG), is defined to be the set of all normalized units u satisfying the property u^{\circledast}=u^{-1}. In this paper we establish the order of V_{\circledast}(FG) for all involutions \circledast which arise from G, where G is a finite cyclic 2-group and show that all \circledast-unitary subgroups of FG are not isomorphic.
