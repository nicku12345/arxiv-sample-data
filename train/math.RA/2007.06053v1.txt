Rota-Baxter systems were introduced by Brzezi\'{n}ski as a generalization of Rota-Baxter operators that are related to dendriform structures, associative Yang-Baxter pairs and covariant bialgebras. In this paper, we define Rota-Baxter systems on Hom-associative algebras and show how they induce Hom-dendriform structures and weak pseudotwistors on the underlying Hom-associative algebra. We introduce Hom-Yang-Baxter pairs and a notion of covariant Hom-bialgebra. Given a Hom-Yang-Baxter pair, we construct a twisted Rota-Baxter system and a (quasitriangular) covariant Hom-bialgebra. Finally, we consider perturbations of the coproduct in a covariant Hom-bialgebra.
