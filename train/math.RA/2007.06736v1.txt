We introduce a pre-Jacobi-Jordan algebras and study some relevant properties such as bimodules, matched pairs. Besides, we established a pre-Jacobi-Jordan algebra built as a direct sum of a given pre-Jacobi-Jordan algebra (\A, \cdot) and its dual (\A^{\ast}, \circ), endowed with a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form B, where \cdot and \circ are the products defined on \A and \A^{\ast}, respectively. Finally, after pre-Jacobi-Jordan algebras classification in dimension two, we thoroughly give some double constructions of pre-Jacobi-Jordan algebraic structures.
