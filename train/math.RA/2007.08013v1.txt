As originally defined by Ashraf and Mozumder, multiplicative (generalized)-skew derivations must satisfy two identities. In this short note we show that, as a consequence of the simultaneous satisfaction of both identities, a multiplicative (generalized)-skew derivation of a prime ring is either a multiplicative (generalized) derivation (i.e., not skew), or a generalized skew derivation (i.e., additive). Therefore only one of the identities should be taken in the definition of multiplicative (generalized)-skew derivations in order to get a new class of derivations in prime rings.
