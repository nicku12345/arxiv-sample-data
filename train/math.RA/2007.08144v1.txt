In this article, we give necessary and sufficient conditions under which the Leavitt path algebra L_K(\mathcal{G}) of an ultragraph \mathcal{G} over a field K is purely infinite simple and that it is von Neumann regular. Consequently, we obtain that every graded simple ultragraph Leavitt path algebra is either a locally matricial algebra, or a full matrix ring over K[x, x^{-1}], or a purely infinite simple algebra.
