We study BiHom-Novikov-Poisson algebras, which are twisted generalizations of Novikov-Poisson algebras and Hom-Novikov-Poisson algebras, and find that BiHom-Novikov-Poisson algebras are closed under tensor products and several kinds of perturbations. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given under which BiHom-Novikov-Poisson algebras give rise to BiHom-Poisson algebras.
