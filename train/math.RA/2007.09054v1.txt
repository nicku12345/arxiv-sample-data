We study linear functions on the space of n \times n matrices over a field which preserve or strongly preserve each of Green's equivalence relations (\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{H} and \mathcal{J}) and the corresponding pre-orders. For each of these relations we are able to completely describe all preservers over an algebraically closed field (or more generally, a field in which every polynomial of degree n has a root), and all strong preservers and bijective preservers over any field. Over a general field, the non-zero \mathcal{J}-preservers are all bijective and coincide with the bijective rank-1 preservers, while the non-zero \mathcal{H}-preservers turn out to be exactly the invertibility preservers, which are known. The \mathcal{L}- and \mathcal{R}-preservers over a field with "few roots" seem harder to describe: we give a family of examples showing that they can be quite wild.
