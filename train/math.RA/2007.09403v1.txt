In 2014, Wolfgang Rump showed that there exists a correspondence between left nilpotent right R-braces and pre-Lie algebras. This correspondence, established using a geometric approach related to flat affine manifolds and affine torsors, works locally. In this paper we explain Rump's correspondence using only algebraic formulae. An algebraic interpretation of the correspondence works for fields of sufficiently large prime characteristic as well as for fields of characteristic zero.
