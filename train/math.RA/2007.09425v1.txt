We study integral theory for left (or right) Hopf left bialgebroids. Contrary to Hopf algebroids, the latter ones don't necessary have an antipode S but, for any element u, the elements u_{(1)} \otimes S(u_{(2)}) (or u_{(2)}\otimes S^{-1}(u_{(1)}) ) does exist. Our results extend those of G. B\"ohm who studied integral theory for Hopf algebroids. We make use of recent results about left Hopf left bialgebroids. We apply our results to the restricted enveloping algebra of a restricted Lie Rinehart algebra.
