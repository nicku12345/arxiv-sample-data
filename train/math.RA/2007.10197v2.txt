Let A be a Koszul Artin-Schelter regular algebra, \sigma a graded automorphism of A and \delta a degree-one \sigma-derivation of A. We introduce an invariant for \delta called the \sigma-divergence of \delta. We describe the Nakayama automorphism of the graded Ore extension B=A[z;\sigma,\delta] explicitly using the \sigma-divergence of \delta, and construct a twisted superpotential \hat{\omega} for B so that it is a derivation quotient algebra defined by \hat{\omega}. We also determine all graded Ore extensions of noetherian Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension 2 and compute their Nakayama automorphisms.
