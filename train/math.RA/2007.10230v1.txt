A zig-zag order is like a directed path, only with alternating directions. A generating set of minimal size for the semigroup of all full transformations on a finite set preserving the zig-zag order was determined by Fenandes et al. in 2019. This paper deals with generating sets of the semigroup F_{\mathbb{N}} of all full transformations on the set of all natural numbers preserving the zig-zag order. We prove that F_{\mathbb{N}} has no minimal generating sets and present two particular infinite decreasing chains of generating sets of F_{\mathbb{N}}.
