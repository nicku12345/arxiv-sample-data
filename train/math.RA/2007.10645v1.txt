This paper describes a new kind of inverse for elements in associative ring, that is the complete inverse, as the unique solution of a certain set of equations. This inverse exists for an element a if and only if the Drazin inverse of a exists. We also show that by plugging in -k for k in the \mathcal{P}-canonical form of a square matrix A, we get the \mathcal{P}-canonical form of the complete inverse of A.
