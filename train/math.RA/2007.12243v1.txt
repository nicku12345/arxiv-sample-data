We study local centrally essential subalgebras in the algebra of all upper triangular matrices over a field of characteristic \ne 2. It is proved that the algebras of upper triangular 3\times 3 or 4\times 4 matrices have only commutative local centrally essential subalgebras. Every algebra of upper triangular matrices of order exceeding 6 contains a non-commutative local centrally essential subalgebra.   The paper will appear in Linear and Multilinear Algebra.
