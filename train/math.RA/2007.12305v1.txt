Let R be an associative ring with unity 1 and consider that 2,k and 2k\in \mathbb{N} are invertible in R. For m\geq 1 denote by UT_n(m,R) and UT_{\infty}(m,R), the subgroups of UT_n(R) and UT_{\infty}(R) respectively, which have zero entries on the first m-1 super diagonals. We show that every element on the groups UT_n(m,R) and UT_{\infty}(m,R) can be expressed as a product of two commutators of involutions and also, can be expressed as a product of two commutators of skew-involutions and involutions in UT_{\infty}(m,R). Similarly, denote by UT^{(s)}_{\infty}(R) the group of upper triangular infinite matrices whose diagonal entries are sth roots of 1. We show that every element of the groups UT_n(\infty,R) and UT_{\infty}(m,R) can be expressed as a product of 4k-6 commutators all depending of powers of elements in UT^{(k)}_{\infty}(m,R) of order k and, also, can be expressed as a product of 8k-6 commutators of skew finite matrices of order 2k and matrices of order 2k in UT^{(2k)}_{\infty}(m,R). If R is the complex field or the real number field we prove that, in SL_n(R) and in the subgroup SL_{VK}(\infty,R) of the Vershik-Kerov group over R, each element in these groups can be decomposed into a product of commutators of elements as described above.
