Let R be an associative algebra over a field K generated by a vector subspace V. The polynomial f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) of the free associative algebra K\langle x_1,x_2,\ldots\rangle is a weak polynomial identity for the pair (R,V) if it vanishes in R when evaluated on V. We survey results on weak polynomial identities and on their applications to polynomial identities and central polynomials of associative and close to them nonassociative algebras and on the finite basis problem. We also present results on weak polynomial identities of degree three.
