We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the partial actions of a groupoid G on a set X and the inverse semigroupoid actions of the Exel's inverse semigroupoid S(G) on X. Furthermore, we prove that there is a bijective connection between actions of inverse semigroupoids (not necessarily of Exel's type) and ordered actions of locally complete inductive groupoids. We also define inverse semigroupoid representations on a Hilbert space H, as well as the Exel's partial groupoid C^*-algebra C_p^*(G), and we prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between partial groupoid representations of G on H, inverse semigroupoid representations of S(G) on H and C^*-algebra representations of C_p^*(G) on H.
