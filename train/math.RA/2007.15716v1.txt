We describe derivations and automorphisms of infinite tensor products of matrix algebras. Using this description we show that for a countable--dimensional locally matrix algebra A over a field \mathbb{F} the dimension of the Lie algebra of outer derivations of A and the order of the group of outer automorphisms of A are both equal to |\mathbb{F}|^{\aleph_0}, where |\mathbb{F}| is the cardinality of the field \mathbb{F}.
