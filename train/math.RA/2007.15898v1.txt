An operation of associative, commutative and distributive multiplication on { Euclidean vector space} \mathbb{E}_4 is introduced by a skew circulant matrix. The resulting algebra \mathbb{W} over \mathbb{R} is isomorphic to \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{C}. The related algebraic, geometrical, and topological properties are given.There are subplanes of \mathbb{W} isomorphic to the Gauss and Clifford complex number planes. A topology on \mathbb{W} is given by a norm which is a sum of two norms. A hint how to apply this 4 dimensional algebra over \mathbb{R} to the 12-tone Equally Tempered Tuning algebra is given.
