We study a special class of weakly associative algebras: the symmetric Leibniz algebras. We describe the structure of the commutative and skew symmetric algebras associated with the polarization-depolarization principle. We also give a structure theorem for the symmetric Leibniz algebras and we study formal deformations in the context of deformation quantization.
