Let F be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and let G be a finite group. Consider G-graded simple algebras A which are finite dimensional and e-central over F, i.e. Z(A)_{e} := Z(A)\cap A_{e} = F. For any such algebra we construct a \textit{generic} G-graded algebra \mathcal{U} which is \textit{Azumaya} in the following sense. (1) \textit{(Correspondence of ideals)}: There is one to one correspondence between the G-graded ideals of \mathcal{U} and the ideals of the ring R, the e-center of \mathcal{U}. (2) \textit{Artin-Procesi condition}: \mathcal{U} satisfies the G-graded identities of A and no nonzero G-graded homomorphic image of \mathcal{U} satisfies properly more identities. (3) \textit{Generic}: If B is a G-graded algebra over a field then it is a specialization of \mathcal{U} along an ideal \mathfrak{a} \in spec(Z(\mathcal{U})_{e}) if and only if it is a G-graded form of A over its e-center.   We apply this to characterize finite dimensional G-graded simple algebras over F that admit a G-graded division algebra form over their e-center.
