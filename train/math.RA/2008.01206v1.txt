Let \boldsymbol{\Lambda}\,(=\mathbb{F}^{n^{3}}), where \mathbb{F} is a field with |\mathbb{F}|>2, be the space of structure vectors of algebras having the n-dimensional \mathbb{F}-space V as the underlying vector space. Also let G=GL(V). Regarding \boldsymbol{\Lambda} as a G-module via the `change of basis' action of~G on~V, we determine the composition factors of various G-submodules of~\boldsymbol{\Lambda} which correspond to certain important families of algebras. This is achieved by introducing the notion of linear degeneration which allows us to obtain analogues over \mathbb{F} of certain known results on degenerations of algebras. As a result, the GL(V)-structure of~\boldsymbol{\Lambda} is determined.
