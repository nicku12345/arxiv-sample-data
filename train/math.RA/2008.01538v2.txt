The concept of variety with IBN (invariant basic number) propriety first appeared in ring theory. But we can define this concept for arbitrary variety of universal algebras with arbitrary signature; see Definition 1.4. The proving of the IBN propriety of some variety is very important in universal algebraic geometry. This is a milestone in the study of the relation between geometric and automorphic equivalences of algebras of this variety. In this paper we prove very simple but very useful for studying of IBN proprieties of different varieties Theorems 2.1 and 3.2. We will consider applications of this theorem. We will consider many-sorted universal algebras as well as one-sorted. So all concepts and all results will by generalized for the many-sorted case.
