Suppose the ground field is algebraically closed and of characteristic different from 2. In this paper, we described the intrinsic connections among linear super-commuting maps, super-biderivations and centroids for Lie superalgebras satisfying certain assumptions. This is a generalization of the results of Bre\check{s}ar and Zhao on Lie algebras.
