Let M_n(K) be the algebra of n \times n matrix over an infinite integral domain K. Let gl_n(K) be the Lie algebra of n \times n matrix with the usual Lie product over K. Let G = \{g_1,\ldots,g_n\} be a group of order n. We describe the polynomials that form a basis for the G-graded identities of the pair (M_n(K),gl_n(K)) with an elementary G-grading induced by the n-tuple (g_1,\ldots,g_n). In the end, we describe an explicit basis for the \mathbb{Z}_3-graded identities of the pair (M_3(K),gl_3(K)).
