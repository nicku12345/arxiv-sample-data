Let F be a finite field of char F = p and size |F| = q. Let E be the unitary infinity dimensional Grassmann algebra. In this short note, we describe the \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2-graded identities of E_{k^{*}}\otimes E, where E_{k^{*}} is the Grassmann algebra with a specific \mathbb{Z}_{2}-grading. In the end, we discuss about the \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2-graded GK-dimension of E_{k^*}\otimes E in m variables.
