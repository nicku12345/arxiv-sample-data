The dual space of the Cartan subalgebra in a Kac-Moody algebra has a partial ordering defined by the rule that two elements are related if and only if their difference is a non-negative or non-positive integer linear combination of simple roots. In this paper, we study the subposet formed by dominant weights in affine Kac-Moody algebras. We give a more explicit description of the covering relations in this poset. We also study the structure of basic cells in this poset of dominant weights for untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebras of type A.
