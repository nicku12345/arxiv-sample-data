This paper gives some constructions results and examples of BiHom-Poisson algebras. Next, BiHom-flexible algebras are defined and it is shown that admissible BiHom-Poisson algebras are BiHom-flexible. Furthermore, generalized derivations of Bihom-Poisson algebras are introduced and some their basic properties are given. Finally, BiHom-Poisson modules and several constructions of these notions are obtained.
