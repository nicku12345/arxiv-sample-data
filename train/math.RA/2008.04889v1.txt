In this paper, we elaborate Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases method for Leibniz (super)algebras. We show that there is a unique reduced Gr\"obner-Shirshov basis for every (graded) ideal of a free Leibniz (super)algebra. As applications, we construct linear bases of free metabelian Leibniz superalgebras and new linear bases of free metabelian Lie algebras. We present a complete characterization of extensions of a Leibniz (super)algebra by another Leibniz (super)algebra, where the former is presented by generators and relations.
