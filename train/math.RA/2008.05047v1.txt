We study semisimple Hopf algebra actions on Artin-Schelter regular algebras and prove several upper bounds on the degrees of the minimal generators of the invariant subring, and on the degrees of syzygies of modules over the invariant subring. These results are analogues of results for group actions on commutative polynomial rings proved by Noether, Fogarty, Fleischmann, Derksen, Sidman, Chardin, and Symonds.
