Firstly, we provide a different proof of an important lemma in Buzzard and Calegari's work on slopes of overconvergent 2-adic modular forms via nonarchimedean linear Hodge-Newton decomposition. The lemma shows that two equivalent matrices with coefficients in the ring of integers in an archimedean field have the same Newton polygon under suitable conditions. Secondly, we give an archimedean analogue of the above lemma.
