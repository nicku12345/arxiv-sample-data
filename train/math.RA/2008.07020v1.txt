The aim of this paper is to give some construction results and examples of BiHom-alternative and BiHom-Jordan algebras. Next, we define BiHom-alternative and BiHom-Jordan (bi)modules and we prove that from a given BiHom-alternative and BiHom-Jordan bimodules, a sequence of this kind of bimodules can be constructed. Some relations between Bihom-associative, BiHom-alternative and BiHom-Jordan bimodules are given.
