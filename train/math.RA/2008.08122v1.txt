Let A be a monomial associative finite dimensional algebra over a field \Bbbk of characteristic zero. It is well known that the Hochschild cohomology of A can be computed using Bardzell's complex B(A). The aim of this article is to describe an explict L_\infty-structure on B(A) that induces a weak equivalence of L_\infty-algebras between B(A) and the Hochschild complex C(A) of A. This allows us to describe the Maurer-Cartan equation in terms of elements of degree 2 in B(A). Finally, we make concrete computations when A is a truncated algebra, and we prove that Bardzell's complex for radical square zero algebras is in fact a dg-Lie algebra.
