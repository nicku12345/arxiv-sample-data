Let A be a multiplier Hopf coquasigroup. If the faithful integrals exist, then they are unique up to scalar. Furthermore, if A is of discrete type, then its integral duality \widehat{A} is a Hopf quasigroup, and the biduality \widehat{\widehat{A}} is isomorphic to the original A as multiplier Hopf coquasigroups. This biduality theorem also holds for a class of Hopf quasigroups with faithful integrals.
