We study the sets of elements of Jordan pairs whose local Jordan algebras are Lesieur-Croisot algebras, that is, classical orders in nondegenerate Jordan algebras with finite capacity. It is then proved that, if the Jordan pair is nondegenerate, the set of its Lesieur-Croisot elements is an ideal of the Jordan pair.
