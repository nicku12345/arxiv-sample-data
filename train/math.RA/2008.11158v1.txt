In this work we approach three-dimensional evolution algebras from certain constructions performed on two-dimensional algebras. More precisely, we provide four different constructions producing three-dimensional evolution algebras from two-dimensional algebras. Also we introduce two parameters, the annihilator stabilizing index and the socle stabilizing index, which are useful tools in the classification theory of these algebras. Finally, we use moduli sets as a convenient way to describe isomorphism classes of algebras.
