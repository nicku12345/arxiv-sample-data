During the past three decades fundamental progress has been made on constructing large torsion-free subgroups (i.e. subgroups of finite index) of the unit group \U (\Z G) of the integral group ring \Z G of a finite group G. These constructions rely on explicit constructions of units in \Z G and proofs of main results make use of the description of the Wedderburn components of the rational group algebra \Q G. The latter relies on explicit constructions of primitive central idempotents and the rational representations of G. It turns out that the existence of reduced two degree representations play a crucial role. Although the unit group is far from being understood, some structure results on this group have been obtained. In this paper we give a survey of some of the fundamental results and the essential needed techniques.
