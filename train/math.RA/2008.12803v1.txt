Let F be an infinite field of characteristic different from 2, and let E be the Grassmann algebra of an infinite dimensional F-vector space L. In this paper we study the \mathbb{Z}-graded polynomial identities of E with respect to certain \mathbb{Z}-grading such that the vector space L is homogeneous in the grading. More precisely, we construct three types of \mathbb{Z}-gradings on E, denoted by E^{\infty}, E^{k^\ast} and E^{k}, and we give the explicit form of the corresponding \mathbb{Z}-graded polynomial identities. We show that the homogeneous superalgebras E_{\infty}, E_{k^\ast} and E_{k} studied in \cite{disil} can be obtained from E^{\infty}, E^{k^\ast} and E^{k} as quotient gradings. Moreover we exhibit several other types of homogeneous \mathbb{Z}-gradings on E, and describe their graded identities.
