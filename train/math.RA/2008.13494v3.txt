In this paper we begin the study of set-theoretic type solution of the braid equation. Our theory includes set-theoretical solutions as basic examples. We show that the relationships between set-theoretical solutions, q-cycle sets, q-braces, skew-braces, matched pairs of groups and invertible 1-cocycles remain valid in our setting.
