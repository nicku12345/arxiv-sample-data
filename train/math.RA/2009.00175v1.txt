Let F be a field of characteristic zero and let E be the Grassmann algebra of an infinite dimensional F-vector space L. In this paper we study the superalgebra structures (that is the \mathbb{Z}_{2}-gradings) that the algebra E admits. By using the duality between superalgebras and automorphisms of order 2 we prove that in many cases the \mathbb{Z}_{2}-graded polynomial identities for such structures coincide with the \mathbb{Z}_{2}-graded polynomial identities of the "typical" cases E_{\infty}, E_{k^\ast} and E_{k} where the vector space L is homogeneous. Recall that these cases were completely described by Di Vincenzo and Da Silva in \cite{disil}. Moreover we exhibit a wide range of non-homogeneous \mathbb{Z}_{2}-gradings on E that are \mathbb{Z}_{2}-isomorphic to E_{\infty}, E_{k^\ast} and E_{k}. In particular we construct a \mathbb{Z}_{2}-grading on E with only one homogeneous generator in L which is \mathbb{Z}_{2}-isomorphic to the natural \mathbb{Z}_{2}-grading on E, here denoted by E_{can}.
