In this paper we describe central extensions (up to isomorphism) of all complex null-filiform and filiform Zinbiel algebras. It is proven that every non-split central extension of an n-dimensional null-filiform Zinbiel algebra is isomorphic to an (n+1)-dimensional null-filiform Zinbiel algebra. Moreover, we obtain all pairwise non isomorphic quasi-filiform Zinbiel algebras.
