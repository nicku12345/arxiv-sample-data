In this paper, we prove that if R is an Archimedean reduced ring and satisfy ACC on annihilators, then R[[x]] is also an Archimedean reduced ring. More generally we prove that if R is a right Archimedean ring satisfying the \emph{ACC} on annihilators and \alpha is a rigid automorphism of R, then the skew power series ring R[[x;\alpha ]] is right Archimedean reduced ring. We also provide some examples to justify the assumptions we made to obtain the required result.
