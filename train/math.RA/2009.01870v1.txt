Let E be the infinite dimensional Grassmann algebra over a field F of characteristic zero. In this paper we investigate the structures of \mathbb{Z}-gradings on E of full support. Using methods of elementary number theory, we describe the \mathbb{Z}-graded polynomial identities for the so-called 2-induced \mathbb{Z}-gradings on E of full support. As a consequence of this fact we provide examples of \mathbb{Z}-gradings on E which are PI-equivalent but not \mathbb{Z}-isomorphic. This is the first example of graded algebras with infinite support that are PI-equivalent and not isomorphic as graded algebras. We also present the notion of central \mathbb{Z}-gradings on E and we show that its \mathbb{Z}-graded polynomial identities are closely related to the \mathbb{Z}_{2}-graded polynomial identities of \mathbb{Z}_{2}-gradings on E.
