We investigate the finitary functions from a finite product of finite fields \prod_{j =1}^m\mathbb{F}_{q_j} = K to a finite product of finite fields \prod_{i =1}^n\mathbb{F}_{p_i} = F, where p_1,\dots,p_n, q_1,\dots,q_m are powers of different primes. An (F,K)-linearly closed clonoid is a subset of these functions which is closed under composition from the right and from the left with linear mappings.   We give a characterization of these subsets of functions through the invariant subspaces of the vector spaces \mathbb{F}_{p_i}^{\prod_{j =1}^m\mathbb{F}_{q_j}} with respect to a certain set of linear transformations. Furthermore we prove that each of these subsets of functions is generated by a set of unary functions and we provide an upper bound for the number of distinct (F,K)-linearly closed clonoid.
