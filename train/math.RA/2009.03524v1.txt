In this paper, we compute all possible differential structures of a 3-dimensional DG Sklyanin algebra \mathcal{A}, which is a connected cochain DG algebra whose underlying graded algebra \mathcal{A}^{\#} is a 3-dimensional Sklyanin algebra S_{a,b,c}. We show that there are three major cases depending on the parameters a,b,c of the underlying Sklyanin algebra S_{a,b,c}: (1) either a^2\neq b^2 or c\neq 0, then \partial_{\mathcal{A}}=0; (2) a=-b and c=0, then the 3-dimensional DG Sklyanin algebra is actually a DG polynomial algebra; and (3) a=b and c=0, then the DG Sklyanin algebra is uniquely determined by a 3\times 3 matrix M. It is worthy to point out that case (2) has been systematically studied in \cite{MGYC} and case (3) is just the DG algebra \mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{O}_{-1}(k^3)}(M) in \cite{MWZ}. Finally, we prove that all 3-dimensional DG Sklyanin algebras are Calabi-Yau DG algebras.
