Let \mathcal{A} be a connected cochain DG algebra, whose underlying graded algebra \mathcal{A}^{#} is the quantum affine n-space \mathcal{O}_{-1}(k^n). We compute all possible differential structures of \mathcal{A} and show that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between   \{\text{cochain DG algebra}\,\,\mathcal{A}\,|\,\mathcal{A}^{#}=\mathcal{O}_{-1}(k^n)\} and the n\times n matrices M_n(k). We also study the isomorphism problems of these non-commutative DG algebras. For the cases n\le 3, we further show that such DG algebras are all Koszul Calabi-Yau DG algebras.
