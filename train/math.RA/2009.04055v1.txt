A method for constructing and analyzing matrix embeddings of algebras E with an ideal isomorphic to M_\infty(K), the infinite matrix algebra with only finitely many nonzero elements, is introduced. This method utilizes the fact that one can express such algebras as an extension of some algebra A by M_\infty(K). Two equivalence relations are then introduced to classify these extensions. The latter equivalence relation will then be used to classify matrix embeddings of the Toeplitz-Jacobson algebra. Finally, with the help of a function which serves as a measure of how far from invertible a matrix is, an infinite family of algebras \mathcal T_i will be constructed such that M_\infty(K) is an ideal of \mathcal T_i and \mathcal T_i/M_\infty(K) \simeq K[x,x^{-1}].
