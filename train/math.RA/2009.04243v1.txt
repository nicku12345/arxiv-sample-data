Let \mathbb{K} be a field such that char(\mathbb{K})\nmid k and char(\mathbb{K})\nmid k+1. We describe all (k+1)-potent matrices over the group of upper triangular matrix. In the case that \mathbb{K} is a finite field we show how to compute the number of these elements in triangular matrix groups and use this formula to compute the number of (k+1)-potent elements in the Incidence Algebra \mathcal{I}(X,\mathbb{K}) where X is a finite poset.
