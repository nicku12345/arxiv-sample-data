We investigate finitary functions from \mathbb{Z}_{n} to \mathbb{Z}_{n} for a squarefree number n. We show that the lattice of all clones on the squarefree set \mathbb{Z}_{p_1\cdots p_m} which contain the addition of \mathbb{Z}_{p_1\cdots p_m} is finite. We provide an upper bound for the cardinality of this lattice through an injective function to the direct product of the lattices of all (\mathbb{Z}_{p_i}, \mathbb{F}_i)-linearly closed clonoids, \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{Z}_{p_i}, \mathbb{F}_i), to the p_i+1 power, where \mathbb{F}_i = \prod_{j \in \{1,\dots,m\}\backslash \{i\}}\mathbb{Z}_{p_j}. These lattices are studied in the litterature and we can find an upper bound for cardinality of them. Furthermore, we prove that these clones can be generated by a set of functions of arity at most \max(p_1,\dots,p_m).
