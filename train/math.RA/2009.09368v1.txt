In this paper, we introduce twisted Rota-Baxter operators on Lie algebras as an operator analogue of twisted r-matrices. We construct a suitable L_\infty-algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements are given by twisted Rota-Baxter operators. This allows us to define cohomology of a twisted Rota-Baxter operator. This cohomology can be seen as the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of a certain Lie algebra with coefficients in a suitable representation. We study deformations of twisted Rota-Baxter operators from cohomological points of view. Some applications are given to Reynolds operators and twisted r-matrices. Next, we introduce a new algebraic structure, called NS-Lie algebras, that are related to twisted Rota-Baxter operators in the same way pre-Lie algebras are related to Rota-Baxter operators. We end this paper by considering twisted generalized complex structures on modules over Lie algebras.
