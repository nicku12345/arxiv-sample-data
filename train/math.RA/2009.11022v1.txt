Given a right ideal I in a ring R, the idealizer of I in R is the largest subring of R in which I becomes a two-sided ideal. In this paper we consider idealizers in the second Weyl algebra A_2, which is the ring of differential operators on \mathbb{k}[x,y] (in characteristic 0). Specifically, let f be a polynomial in x and y which defines an irreducible curve whose singularities are all cusps. We show that the idealizer of the right ideal fA_2 in A_2 is always left and right noetherian, extending the work of McCaffrey.
