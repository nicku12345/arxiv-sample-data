We study the universal enveloping associative conformal algebra for the central extension of a current Lie conformal algebra at the locality level N=3. A standard basis of defining relations for this algebra is explicitly calculated. As a corollary, we find a linear basis of the free commutative conformal algebra relative to the locality N=3 on the generators.
