A hom-associative algebra is an algebra whose associativity is twisted by an algebra homomorphism. It was previously shown by the author that the Hochschild cohomology of a hom-associative algebra A carries a Gerstenhaber structure. In this short paper, we show that this Gerstenhaber structure together with certain operations on the Hochschild homology of A makes a noncommutative differential calculus. As an application, we obtain a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structure on the Hochschild cohomology of a regular unital symmetric hom-associative algebra.
