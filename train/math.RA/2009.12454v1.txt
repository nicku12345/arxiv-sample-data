This paper is a new contribution to the partial Galois theory of groups. First, given a unital partial action \alpha_G of a finite group G on an algebra S such that S is an \alpha_G-partial Galois extension of S^{\alpha_G} and a normal subgroup H of G, we prove that \alpha_G induces a unital partial action \alpha_{G/H} of G/H on the subalgebra of invariants S^{\alpha_H} of S such that S^{\alpha_H} is an \alpha_{G/H}-partial Galois extension of S^{\alpha_G}. Second, assuming that G is abelian, we construct a commutative inverse semigroup T_{par}(G,R), whose elements are equivalence classes of \alpha_G-partial abelian extensions of a commutative algebra R. We also prove that there exists a group isomorphism between T_{par}(G,R)/\rho and T(G,A), where \rho is a congruence on T_{par}(G,R) and T(G,A) is the classical Harrison group of the G-isomorphism classes of the abelian extensions of a commutative ring A. It is shown that the study of T_{par}(G,R) reduces to the case where G is cyclic. The set of idempotents of T_{par}(G,R) is also investigated.
