Given any finite ring, we'll construct a partition of it, where each block corresponds to one idempotent. The partition is so simple that it works for any finite power-associative algebra (in particular for any finite associative, Jordan, or Cayley-Dickson algebra.) We prove in particular that idempotents and regular elements can always be lifted (over homomorphisms) for finite rings.
