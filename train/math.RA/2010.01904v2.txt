We investigate almost inner derivations of some finite-dimensional nilpotent Leibniz algebras. We show the existence of almost inner derivations of Leibniz filiform non-Lie algebras differing from inner derivations, we also show that the almost inner derivations of some filiform Leibniz algebras containing filiform Lie algebras do not coincide with inner derivations.
