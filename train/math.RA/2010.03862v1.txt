In this paper, we present a novel method to compute an explicit formula for the inverse of the confluent Vandermonde matrices. Our proposed results may have many interesting perspectives in diverse areas of mathematics and natural sciences, notably on the situations where the Vandermonde matrices have acquired much usefulness. The method presented here is direct and straightforward, it gives explicit and compact formulas not exist in the large literature on this essential topic. Several examples are presented to highlight the results. Our main tools are some elementary basic linear algebra.
