We consider the question of the boundedness of matrix products A_{n}B_{n}\cdots A_{1}B_{1} with factors from two sets of matrices, A_{i}\in\mathscr{A} and B_{i}\in\mathscr{B}, due to an appropriate choice of matrices \{B_{i}\}. It is assumed that for any sequence of matrices \{A_{i}\} there is a sequence of matrices \{B_{i}\} for which the sequence of matrix products \{A_{n}B_{n}\cdots A_{1}B_{1}\}_{n=1}^{\infty} is norm bounded. Some situations are described in which in this case the norms of matrix products A_{n}B_{n}\cdots A_{1}B_{1} are uniformly bounded, that is, \|A_{n}B_{n}\cdots A_{1}B_{1}\|\le C for all natural numbers n, where C>0 is some constant independent of the sequence \{A_{i}\} and the corresponding sequence \{B_{i}\}. In the general case, the question of the validity of the corresponding statement remains open.
