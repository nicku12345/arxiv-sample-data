Let K be a finite field extension of \Q and let N be a finite group with automorphism group F=\Aut(N). R. Haggenm\"{u}ller and B. Pareigis have shown that there is a bijection \[\Theta: {\mathcal Gal}(K,F)\rightarrow {\mathcal Hopf}(K[N])\] from the collection of F-Galois extensions of K to the collection of Hopf forms of the group ring K[N]. For N=C_n, n\ge 1, C_p^m, p prime, m\ge 1, and N=D_3,D_4,Q_8, we show that \Q[N] admits an absolutely semisimple Hopf form H and find L for which \Theta (L)=H. Moreover, if H is the Hopf algebra given by a Hopf-Galois structure on a Galois extension E/K, we show how to construct the preimage of H under \Theta assuming certain conditions.
