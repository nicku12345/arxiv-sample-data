A finite group G is said to have the nilpotent decomposition property (ND) if for every nilpotent element \alpha of the integral group ring \mathbb{Z}[G] one has that \alpha e also belong to \mathbb{Z}[G], for every primitive central idempotent e of the rational group algebra \mathbb{Q}[G]. Results of Hales, Passi and Wilson, Liu and Passman show that this property is fundamental in the investigations of the multiplicative Jordan decomposition of integral group rings. If G and all its subgroups have ND then Liu and Passman showed that G has property SSN, that is, for subgroups H, Y and N of G, if N\lhd H  and Y\subseteq H then N\subseteq Y or YN is normal in H; and such groups have been described. In this article, we study the nilpotent decomposition property in integral group rings and we classify finite SSN groups G such that the rational group algebra \mathbb{Q}[G] has only one Wedderburn component which is not a division ring.
