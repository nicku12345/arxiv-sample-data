We study the set \mathcal{L}_{F} of all F-vector spaces L(P), the set of linear recurrence sequences over F with characteristic polynomial P monic and splits over F. We show that \mathcal{L}_{F} is a commutative semiring graded by the multiplicative monoid F. This study allows us to find explicitly the polynomial P\in F[X] such that L(P)=\prod_{i=1}^{m}L(P_{i}), where P_{1}, \ldots, P_{m} are any monic polynomials over F.
