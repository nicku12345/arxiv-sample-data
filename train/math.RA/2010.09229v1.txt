Let (X,\bullet ) be a groupoid (binary algebra) and Bin(X\dot{)} denote the collection of all groupoids defined on X. We introduce two methods of factorization for this binary system under the binary groupoid product \textquotedblleft \diamond \textquotedblright\ in the semigroup \left( Bin\left( X\right) ,\diamond \right) . We conclude that a strong non-idempotent groupoid can be represented as a product of its \textit{% similar-} and \textit{signature-} derived factors. Moreover, we show that a groupoid with the orientation property is a product of its \textit{orient-} and \textit{skew-} factors. These unique factorizations can be useful for various applications in other areas of study. Application to algebras such as B/BCH/BCI/BCK/BH/BI/d-algebra are widely given throughout this paper.
