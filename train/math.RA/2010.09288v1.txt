We build on the recent characterisation of congruences on the infinite twisted partition monoids \mathcal{P}_{n}^\Phi and their finite d-twisted homomorphic images \mathcal{P}_{n,d}^\Phi, and investigate their algebraic and order-theoretic properties. We prove that each congruence of \mathcal{P}_{n}^\Phi is (finitely) generated by at most \lceil\frac{5n}2\rceil pairs, and we characterise the principal ones. We also prove that the congruence lattice \textsf{Cong}(\mathcal{P}_{n}^\Phi) is not modular (or distributive); it has no infinite ascending chains, but it does have infinite descending chains and infinite antichains. By way of contrast, the lattice \textsf{Cong}(\mathcal{P}_{n,d}^\Phi) is modular but still not distributive for d>0, while \textsf{Cong}(\mathcal{P}_{n,0}^\Phi) is distributive. We also calculate the number of congruences of \mathcal{P}_{n,d}^\Phi, showing that the array \big(|\textsf{Cong}(\mathcal{P}_{n,d}^\Phi)|\big)_{n,d\geq 0} has a rational generating function, and that for a fixed n or d, |\textsf{Cong}(\mathcal{P}_{n,d}^\Phi)| is a polynomial in d or n\geq 4, respectively.
