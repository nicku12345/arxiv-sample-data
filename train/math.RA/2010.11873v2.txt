Using \mathcal{P}-canonical forms of matrices, we derive the minimal polynomial of the Kronecker product of a given family of matrices in terms of the minimal polynomials of these matrices. This, allows us to prove that the product \prod\limits_{i=1}^{m}L(P_{i}), L(P_{i}) is the set of linear recurrence sequences over a field F with characteristic polynomial P_{i}, is equal to L(P) where P is the minimal polynomial of the Kronecker product of the companion matrices of P_{i}, 1\leq i\leq m. Also, we show how we deduce from the \mathcal{P}-canonical form of an arbitrary complex matrix A, the \mathcal{P}-canonical form of the matrix function e^{tA} and a logarithm of A.
