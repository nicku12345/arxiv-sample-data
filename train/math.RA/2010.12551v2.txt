In this work, we provide new explicit formulas for computing the exponential of any square matrix by adopting a novel approach. Our method is direct and elementary, it gives tractable and manageable formulas not current in the extensive literature on this essential subject. Moreover, others are recuperated and generalized. As a consequence, we easily obtain the Chevalley-Jordan decomposition, the spectral projections, the arbitrary positive powers of matrices and their Drazin inverses, and explicit formulas for logarithm of matrices. Our essential tools used here are the change of basis Theorem and some polynomial matrices. Several particular cases and examples are formulated to illustrate the method.
