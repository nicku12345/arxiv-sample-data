For a 3-dimensional quantum polynomial algebra A=\mathcal{A}(E,\sigma), Artin-Tate-Van den Bergh showed that A is finite over its center if and only if |\sigma|<\infty. Moreover, Artin showed that if A is finite over its center and E\neq \mathbb{P}^2, then A has a fat point module, which plays an important role in noncommutative algebraic geometry, however the converse is not true in general. In this paper, we will show that, if E\neq \mathbb{P}^2, then A has a fat point module if and only if the quantum projective plane \mathsf{Proj}_{{\rm nc}} A is finite over its center in the sense of this paper if and only if |\nu^*\sigma^3|<\infty where \nu is the Nakayama automorphism of A.In particular, we will show that if the second Hessian of E is zero, then A has no fat point module.
