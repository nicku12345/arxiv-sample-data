We prove that if u:K \rightarrow M is a left minimal extension, then there exists an isomorphism between two subrings, \textrm{End}_R^M(K) and \textrm{End}_R^K(M) of \textrm{End}_R(K) and \textrm{End}_R(M) respectively, modulo their Jacobson radicals. This isomorphism is used to deduce properties of the endomorphism ring of K from those of the endomorphism ring of M in certain situations such us when K is invariant under endomorphisms of M, or when K is invariant under automorphisms of M.
