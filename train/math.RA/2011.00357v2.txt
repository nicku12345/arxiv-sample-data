We consider applications of a finitary version of the Affine Representability theorem, which follows from recent work of Belov-Kanel, Rowen, and Vishne. Using this result we are able to show that when given a finite set of polynomial identities, there is an algorithm that terminates after a finite number of steps which decides whether these identities force a ring to be commutative. We then revisit old commutativity theorems of Jacobson and Herstein in light of this algorithm and obtain general results in this vein. In addition, we completely characterize the homogeneous multilinear identities that imply the commutativity of a ring.
