A new dimension function on countable-dimensional algebras (over a field) is described. Its dimension values for finitely generated algebras exactly fill the unit interval [0,1]. Since the free algebra on two generators turns out to have dimension 0 (although conceivably some Noetherian algebras might have positive dimension!), this dimension function promises to distinguish among algebras of infinite GK-dimension.
