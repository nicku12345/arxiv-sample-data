We derive a general result about commuting actions on certain objects in braided rigid monoidal categories. This enables us to define an action of the Brauer algebra on the tensor space V^{\otimes k} which commutes with the action of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra \spo(V) and the orthosymplectic Lie color algebra \spo(V,\beta). We use the Brauer algebra action to compute maximal vectors in V^{\otimes k} and to decompose V^{\otimes k} into a direct sum of submodules T^\lambda. We compute the characters of the modules T^\lambda, give a combinatorial description of these characters in terms of tableaux, and model the decomposition of V^{\otimes k} into the submodules T^\lambda with a Robinson-Schensted-Knuth type insertion scheme.
