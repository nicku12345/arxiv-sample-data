We give a criterion for a group homomorphism on a valued abelian group to be surjective and to preserve spherical completeness. We apply this to give a criterion for the existence of integration on a valued differential field. Further, we give a criterion for a sum of spherically complete subgroups of a valued abelian group to be spherically complete. This in turn can be used to determine elementary properties of power series fields in positive characteristic.
