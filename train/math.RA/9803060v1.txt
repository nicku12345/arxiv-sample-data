Let \|A\|_{p,q} be the norm induced on the matrix A with n rows and m columns by the H\"older \ell_p and \ell_q norms on R^n and R^m (or C^n and C^m), respectively. It is easy to find an upper bound for the ratio \|A\|_{r,s}/\|A\|_{p,q}. In this paper we study the classes of matrices for which the upper bound is attained. We shall show that for fixed A, attainment of the bound depends only on the signs of r-p and s-q. Various criteria depending on these signs are obtained. For the special case p=q=2, the set of all matrices for which the bound is attained is generated by means of singular value decompositions.
