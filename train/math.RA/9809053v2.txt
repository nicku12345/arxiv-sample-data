The splitting of the Goldie (or singular) torsion theory has been extensively studied. Here we determine an appropriate dual Goldie torsion theory, discuss its splitting and answer in the negative a question proposed by Ozcan and Harmanci as to whether the splitting of the dual Goldie torsion theory implies the ring to be quasi-Frobenius.
