Standard noncommutative Gr\"obner basis procedures are used for computing ideals of free noncommutative polynomial rings over fields. This paper describes Gr\"obner basis procedures for one-sided ideals in finitely presented noncommutative algebras over fields. The polynomials defining a K-algebra A as a quotient of a free K-algebra are combined with the polynomials defining a one-sided ideal I of A, by using a tagging notation. Standard noncommutative Gr\"obner basis techniques can then be applied to the mixed set of polynomials, thus calculating A/I whilst working in a free structure, avoiding the complication of computing in A. The paper concludes by showing how the results can be applied to completable presentations of semigroups and so enable calculations of Green's relations.
