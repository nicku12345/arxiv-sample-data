Given a Lie algebra \frak{g}, the \emph{Nahm algebra} of \frak{g} is the vector space \frak{g}\times \frak{g}\times \frak{g} with the natural commutative, nonassociative algebra structure associated with the Nahm equations \dot{x} = [y,z], \dot{y} = [z,x], \dot{z} = [x,y]. Motivated by potential application to the study of these equations, we herein initiate the study of Nahm algebras.
