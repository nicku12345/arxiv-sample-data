{\sc CLIFFORD} is a Maple package for computations in Clifford algebras \cl (B) of an arbitrary symbolic or numeric bilinear form B. In particular, B may have a non-trivial antisymmetric part. It is well known that the symmetric part g of B determines a unique (up to an isomorphism) Clifford structure on \cl(B) while the antisymmetric part of B changes the multilinear structure of \cl(B). As an example, we verify Helmstetter's formula which relates Clifford product in \cl(g) to the Clifford product in \cl(B). Experimentation with Clifford algebras \cl(B) of a general form~B is highly desirable for physical reasons and can be easily done with {\sc CLIFFORD}. One such application includes a derivation of a representation of Hecke algebras in ideals generated by q-Young operators. Any element (multivector) of \cl(B) is represented in Maple as a multivariate Clifford polynomial in the Grassmann basis monomials although other bases, such as the Clifford basis, may also be used. Using the well-known isomorphism between simple Clifford algebras \cl(Q) of a quadratic form Q and matrix algebras through a faithful spinor representation, one can translate standard matrix algebra problems into the Clifford algebra language. We show how the Singular Value Decomposition of a matrix can be performed in a Clifford algebra. Clifford algebras of a degenerate quadratic form provide a convenient tool with which to study groups of rigid motions in robotics. With the help from {\sc CLIFFORD} we can actually describe all elements of \Pin(3) and \Spin(3). Rotations in \BR^3 can then be generated by unit quaternions realized as even elements in \cl^{+}_{0,3}. Throughout this work all symbolic computations are performed with {\sc CLIFFORD} and its extensions.
