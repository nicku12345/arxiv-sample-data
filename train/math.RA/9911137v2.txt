The classes of FP-injective and weakly quasi-Frobenius rings are investigated. The properties for both classes of rings are closely linked with embedding of finitely presented modules in fp-flat and free modules respectively. Using these properties, we describe the classes of coherent CF and FGF-rings. Moreover, it is proved that the group ring R(G) is FP-injective (resp. weakly quasi-Frobenius) if and only if the ring R is FP-injective (resp. weakly quasi-Frobenius) and the group G is locally finite.
