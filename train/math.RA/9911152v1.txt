Given a definite nonnegative matrix A \in M_n (C), we study the minimal index of A: I(A) = \max \{\lambda \ge 0 : A\circ B \ge \lambda B for all 0\le B\}, where A\circ B denotes the Hadamard product (A\circ B)_{ij} = A_{ij} B_{ij}. For any unitary invariant norm N in M_n(C), we consider the N-index of A: I(N,A) = \min\{N(A\circ B) : B\ge 0 and N(B) = 1 \}. If A has nonnegative entries, then I(A) = I(\| \cdot \|_{sp}, A) if and only if there exists a vector u with nonnegative entries such that Au = (1, >..., 1)^T. We also show that I(\| \cdot \|_{2}, A)= I(\| \cdot \|_{sp}, {\bar A}\circ A)^{1/2}. We give formulae for I(N, A), for an arbitrary unitary invariant norm N, when A is a diagonal matrix or a rank 1 matrix. As an application we find, for a bounded invertible selfadjoint operator S on a Hilbert space, the best constant M(S) such that \|STS + S^{-1} T S^{-1} \| \ge M(S) \|T\|  for all 0 \le T.
