Let n geq 1, let lambda be a partition of n, let mu be a partition arising from lambda by a downwards shift of two boxes situated at the bottom of a column. We give a formula for a ZS_n-linear morphism of order m between the corresponding Specht modules over Z/(m), where m is the box shift length (divided by two in certain combinatorially specified cases). Reformulated, this yields an extension of the corresponding Specht modules over Z of order m in Ext^1.
