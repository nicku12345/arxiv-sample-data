In this paper branching rules for the fundamental representations of the symplectic groups in positive characteristic are found. The submodule structure of the restrictions of the fundamental modules for the group Sp_{2n}(K) to the naturally embedded subgroup Sp_{2n-2}(K) is determined. As a corollary, inductive systems of fundamental representations for Sp_{\infty}(K) are classified. The submodule structure of the fundamental Weyl modules is refined.
