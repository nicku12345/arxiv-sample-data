The behavior of the images of a fixed element of order p in irreducible representations of a classical algebraic group in odd characteristic p with highest weights large enough with respect to p and this element is investigated. Lower estimates for the number of Jordan blocks of size p in images of such elements that lie in naturally embedded subgroups of the same type as the initial group and smaller ranks are obtained.
