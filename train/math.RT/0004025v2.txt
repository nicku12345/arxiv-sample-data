This paper deals with the analytic continuation of holomorphic automorphic forms on a Lie group G. We prove that for any discrete subgroup \Gamma of G there always exists a non-trivial holomorphic automorphic form, i.e., there exists a \Gamma-spherical unitary highest weight representation of G. Holomorphic automorphic forms have the property that they analytically extend to holomorphic functions on a complex Ol'shanski\u\i{} semigroup S\subeq G_\C. As an application we prove that the bounded holomorphic functions on \Gamma\bs S\subseteq \Gamma\bs G_\C separate the points.
