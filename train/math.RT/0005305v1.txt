Vogan and Barbasch-Vogan attach two similar invariants to representations of a reductive Lie group, one by an algebraic process, the other analytic. They conjectured that the two invariants determine each other in a definite manner. Here we prove the conjecture. Our arguments involve two finer invariants -- the characteristic cycles of representations -- which are interesting in their own right.
