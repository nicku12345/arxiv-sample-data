Let G be a connected reductive group defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, when p is a good prime, we give a new proof of the ``order formula'' of D. Testerman for unipotent elements in G; moreover, we show that the same formula determines the p-nilpotence degree of the corresponding nilpotent elements in the Lie algebra of G.   Second, if G is semisimple and p is sufficiently large, we show that G always has a faithful representation (r,V) with the property that the exponential of dr(X) lies in r(G) for each p-nilpotent X in Lie(G). This property permits a simplification of the description given by Suslin, Friedlander, and Bendel of the (even) cohomology ring for the Frobenius kernels G_d, d > 1. The previous authors already observed that the natural representation of a classical group has the above property (with no restriction on p). Our methods apply to any Chevalley group and hence give the result also for quasisimple groups with ``exceptional type'' root systems. The methods give explicit sufficient conditions on p; for an adjoint semisimple G with Coxeter number h, the condition p > 2h -2 is always good enough.
