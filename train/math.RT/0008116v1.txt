A systematic exposition is given of the theory of invariant differential operators on a not necessarily reductive homogeneous space. This exposition is modelled on Helgason's treatment of the general reductive case and the special non-reductive case of the space of horocycles. As a final application the differential operators on (not a priori reductive) isotropic pseudo-Riemannian spaces are characterized.
