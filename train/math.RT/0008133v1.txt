We give a detailed calculation of the Hochschild and cyclic homology of the algebra \CIc(G) of locally constant, compactly supported functions on a reductive p-adic group G. We use these calculations to extend to arbitrary elements the definition the higher orbital integrals introduced in \cite{Blanc-Brylinski} for regular semisimple elements. Then we extend to higher orbital integrals some results of Shalika. We also investigate the effect of the ``induction morphism'' on Hochschild homology.
