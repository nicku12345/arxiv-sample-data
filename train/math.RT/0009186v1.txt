The category of representations with a strongly typical central character of a basic classical Lie superalgebra is proven to be equivalent to the category of representations of its even part corresponding to an appropriate central character.   For a Lie superalgebra osp(1,2l) the category of representations with a "generic" weakly atypical central character is described.
