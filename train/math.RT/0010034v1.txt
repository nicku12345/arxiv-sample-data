Let G be a non-connected reductive real Lie group. In this paper, I parametrize the set of irreductible tempered characters of G. Afterwards, I describe these characters by means of some ``Kirillov's formulas'', using the descent method near each elliptic element in G.   If G is linear and connected, the parameters that I use are ``final basic'' parameters in the sense of Knapp and Zuckerman.
