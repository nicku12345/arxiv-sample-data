Let G be a simply connected semi-simple complex algebraic group. Fix a maximal torus T and a Borel subgroup B such that T\subset B\subset G. Let W the Weyl group of G relative to T. For any w in W, let X_w=\bar {BwB/B} denote the Schubert variety corresponding to w. This talk is concerned with the following problem : Is there a flat family over Spec{\bf C}[t], such that the general fiber is X_w and the special fiber is a toric variety? Our approach of the problem is based on the canonical/global base of Lusztig/Kashiwara and the so-called string parametrization of this base studied by P. Littelmann and made precise by A. Berenstein and A. Zelevinsky. Fix w in W and let P^+ be the semigroup of dominant weights. For all \lambda in P^+, let {\cal L}_\lambda be the line bundle on G/B corresponding to \lambda. Then, the direct sum of global sections R_w:=\bigoplus_{\lambda\in P^+}H^0(X_w,{\cal L}_\lambda) carries a natural structure of P^+-graded {\bf C}-algebra. Moreover, there exists a natural action of T on R_w. Our principal result can be stated as follows : There exists a filtration ({\cal F}_m^w)_{m\in{\bf N}} of R_w such that (i) for all m in {\bf N}, {\cal F}_m^w is compatible with the P^+-grading of R_w, (ii) for all m in {\bf N}, {\cal F}_m^w is compatible with the action of T, (iii) the associated graded algebra is the {\bf C}-algebra of the semigroup of integral points in a rational convex polyhedral cone. Equations for this cone were obtained by A. Berenstein and A. Zelevinski from \tilde w_0-trails in fundamental Weyl modules of the Langlands dual of G. By standard arguments, the previous theorem gives a positive answer to the Degeneration Problem.
