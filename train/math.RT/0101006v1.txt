The Iwahori-Hecke algebra has a ``natural'' trace \tau. This trace is the evaluation at the identity element in the usual interpretation of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra as a sub-algebra of the convolution algebra of a p-adic semi-simple group. The Iwahori-Hecke algebra contains an important commutative sub-algebra {\bf C}[\theta_x], that was described and studied by Bernstein, Zelevinski and Lusztig. In this note we compute the generating function for the value of \tau on the basis \theta_x.
