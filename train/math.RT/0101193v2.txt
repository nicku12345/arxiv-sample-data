In this paper, by establishing an explicit and combinatorial description of the centralizer of a distinguished nilpotent pair in a classical simple Lie algebra, we solve in the classical case Panyushev's Conjecture which says that distinguished nilpotent pairs are wonderful, and the classification problem on almost principal nilpotent pairs. More precisely, we show that disinguished nilpotent pairs are wonderful in types A, B and C, but they are not always wonderful in type D. Also, as the corollary of the classification of almost principal nilpotent pairs, we have that almost principal nilpotent pairs do not exist in the simply-laced case and that the centralizer of an almost principal nilpotent pair in a classical simple Lie algebra is always abelian.
