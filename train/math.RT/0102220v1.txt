George Lusztig conjectured that asymptotic affine Hecke algebra of a simply connected group can be explicitly described in terms of convolution algebras. Main Theorem of this note (which is a continuation of RT/0010089) is a weak version of this Conjecture. This version is strong enough to reprove all previously known results (due to Nanhua Xi) in this direction, for example the case of type \tilde A_n, see QA/0010159.
