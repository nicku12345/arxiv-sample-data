Let A be an associative simple (central) superalgebra over {\mathbb C} and L an invariant linear functional on it (trace). Let a\mapsto a^t be an antiautomorphism of A such that (a^t)^ t=(-1)^{p(a)}a, where p(a) is the parity of a, and let L(a^t)=L(a). Then A admits a nondegenerate supersymmetric invariant bilinear form \langle a, b\rangle=L(ab^t). For A=U({\mathfrak{sl}}(2))/{\mathfrak{m}}, where {\mathfrak{m}} is any maximal ideal of U({\mathfrak{sl}}(2)), Leites and I have constructed orthogonal basis in A whose elements turned out to be, essentially, Chebyshev (Hahn) polynomials in one discrete variable. Here I take A=U({\mathfrak{osp}}(1|2))/{\mathfrak{m}} for any maximal ideal {\mathfrak{m}} and apply a similar procedure. As a result we obtain either Hahn polynomials over {\mathbb C}[\tau], where \tau^2\in{\mathbb C}, or a particular case of Meixner polynomials, or --- when A=\mbox{Mat}(n+1|n) --- dual Hahn polynomials of even degree, or their (hopefully, new) analogs of odd degree. Observe that the nondegenerate bilinear forms we consider for orthogonality are, as a rule, not sign definite.
