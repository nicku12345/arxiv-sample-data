In our previous paper, Green functions associated to complex reflection groups G(e,1,n) were discussed. It involved a combinatorial approach to the Green functions of classical groups of type B_n or C_n. In this paper, we introduce Green functions associated to complex reflection groups G(e,p,n). We define Schur functions, Hall-Littlewood functions associated to G(e,p,n), and show that our Green functions are obtained as a transition matrix between those two kinds of symmetric functions. As a special case, it gives a combinatorial treatmnet of Green functions of type D_n.
