Distinguished involutions in the affine Weyl groups, defined by G. Lusztig, play an essential role in the Kazhdan-Lusztig combinatorics of these groups. A distinguished involution is called canonical if it is the shortest element in its double coset with respect to the finite Weyl group. Each two-sided cell in the affine Weyl group contains precisely one canonical distinguished involution. In this note we calculate the canonical distinguished involutions in the affine Weyl groups of rank <8. We also prove some partial results relating canonical distinguished involutions and Dynkin's diagrams of the nilpotent orbits in the Langlands dual group.
