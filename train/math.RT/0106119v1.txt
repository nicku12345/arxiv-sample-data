Using n finite order automorphisms on a simple complex Lie algebra we construct twisted n-toroidal Lie algebras. Thus obtaining Lie algebras wich have a rootspace decomposition. For the case n=2 we list certain simple Lie algebras and their automorphisms, which produce twisted 2-toroidal algebras. In this way we obtain Lie algebras that are related to all Extended Affine Root Systems of K. Saito.
