I show that the projective Schur functions may be interpreted as bispherical functions of either the triple (q(n),gl(n,n),q(n)), where q(n) is the "odd" (queer) analog of the general liner Lie algebra, or the triple (p(n),gl(n,n),p(n)), where p(n) is the periplectic Lie superalgebra which preserves the nondegenerate odd, bilinear form (either symmetric or skew symmetric). Making use of this interpretation I characterize projective Schur functions as common eigenfunctions of an algebra differential operators.
