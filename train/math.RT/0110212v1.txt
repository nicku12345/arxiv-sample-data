Let \mathbb D=G/K be a complex bounded symmetric domain of tube type in a Jordan algebra V_{\mathbb C}, and let D=H/L =\mathbb D\cap V be its real form in a Jordan algebra V\subset V_{\mathbb C}. The analytic continuation of the holomorphic discrete series on \mathbb D forms a family of interesting representations of G. We consider the restriction on D of the scalar holomorphic representations of G, as a representation of H. The unitary part of the restriction map gives then a generalization of the Segal-Bargmann transform. The group L is a spherical subgroup of K and we find a canonical basis of L-invariant polynomials in components of the Schmid decomposition and we express them in terms of the Jack symmetric polynomials. We prove that the Segal-Bargmann transform of those L-invariant polynomials are, under the spherical transform on D, multi-variable Wilson type polynomials and we give a simple alternative proof of their orthogonality relation. We find the expansion of the spherical functions on D, when extended to a neighborhood in \mathbb D, in terms of the L-spherical holomorphic polynomials on \mathbb D, the coefficients being the Wilson polynomials.
