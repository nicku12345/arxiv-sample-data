Let G(K) be the group of K-rational points of a connected adjoint simple algebraic group defined over a non-archimedean local field K. In this paper we classify the unipotent representations of G(K) in terms of the geometry of the Langlands dual group. (This was known earlier in the special case where G(K) is an inner form of a split group.) We also determine which representations are tempered or square integrable.
