Here we continue to list the differential operators invariant with respect to the 15 exceptional simple Lie superalgebras of polynomial vector fields. A part of the list (for operators acting on tensors with finite dimensional fibers) was earlier obtained in 2 of the 15 cases by Kochetkov and in one more instance by Kac and Rudakov. Broadhurst and Kac conjectured that some of these structures pertain to the Standard Models of elementary particles and the Grand Unified Theories. So, GUT, if any exists, will be formulated in terms of operators we found, or their r-nary analogs to be found. Calculations are performed with the aid of Grozman's Mathematica-based SuperLie package. When degeneracy conditions are violated (absence of singular vectors) the corresponding module of tensor fields is irreducible. We consider generalized tensors corresponding to fibers of countable infinite dimension, not only finite dimensional ones. We also verified some of the earlier findings.
