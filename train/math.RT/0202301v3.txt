Symplectic reflection algebras arise in many different mathematical disciplines: integrable systems, Lie theory, representation theory, differential operators, symplectic geometry. In this paper, we introduce baby Verma modules for symplectic reflection algebras of complex reflection groups at parameter t=0 (the so--called rational Cherednik algebras at parameter t=0) and present their most basic properties. By analogy with the representation theory of reductive Lie algebras in positive characteristic, we believe these modules are fundamental to the understanding of the representation theory and associated geometry of the rational Cherednik algebras at parameter t=0. As an example, we use baby Verma modules to answer several problems posed by Etingof and Ginzburg, and give an elementary proof of a theorem of Finkelberg and Ginzburg.
