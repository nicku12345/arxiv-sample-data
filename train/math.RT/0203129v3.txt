The elementary divisors of the Gram matrices of Specht modules S^lambda over the symmetric group are determined for two-row partitions and for two-column partitions lambda. More precisely, the subquotients of the Jantzen filtration are calculated using Schaper's formula. Moreover, considering a general partition lambda of n at a prime p > n - lambda_1, the only possible non trivial composition factor of S_p^lambda is induced by the morphism of Carter and Payne, as shown by means of Kleshchev's modular branching rule. This enables the Jantzen filtration to be calculated in this case as well.
