We describe the irreducible components of Springer fibers for hook and two-row nilpotent elements of gl_n(C) as iterated bundles of flag manifolds and Grassmannians. We then relate the topology (in particular, the intersection homology Poincare' polynomials) of the intersections of these components with the inner products of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis elements of irreducible representations of the rational Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type A corresponding to the hook and two-row Young shapes.
