A family of polynomials parameterized by the conjugacy classes of a finite Coxeter group is investigated. These polynomials, together with the character table of the group, determine the associated generic degrees. The polynomials are described completely for classes that meet a parabolic subgroup whose components are of type A or are dihedral, and for the class of Coxeter elements.
