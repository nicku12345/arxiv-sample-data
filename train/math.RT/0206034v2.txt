Making use of a Howe duality involving the infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebra \hgltwo and the finite-dimensional group GL_l we derive a character formula for a certain class of irreducible quasi-finite representations of \hgltwo in terms of hook Schur functions. We use the reduction procedure of \hgltwo to \hat{gl}_{n|n} to derive a character formula for a certain class of level 1 highest weight irreducible representations of \hat{gl}_{n|n}, the affine Lie superalgebra associated to the finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra gl_{n|n}. These modules turn out to form the complete set of integrable \hat{gl}_{n|n}-modules of level 1. We also show that the characters of all integrable level 1 highest weight irreducible \hat{gl}_{m|n}-modules may be written as a sum of products of hook Schur functions.
