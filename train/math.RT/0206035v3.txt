We study Kazhdan-Lusztig cells and the corresponding representations of right-angled Coxeter groups and Hecke algebras associated to them. In case of the infinite groups generated by reflections in the hyperbolic plane about the sides of right-angled polygons we obtain an explicit description of the left and two-sided cells. In particular, we prove that there are infinitely many left cells but they all form only three two-sided cells.
