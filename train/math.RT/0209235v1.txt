This is a companion article to my papers on Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and character formulae for the Lie superalgebras gl(m|n) (much revised!) and q(n). The goal is to develop the general theory of tilting modules for Lie superalgebras, working in a general graded setting very similar to work of Soergel (Character formulae for tilting modules over Kac-Moody algebras, Represent. Theory 2 (1998), 432-438) in the Lie algebra case. Examples are given involving the Lie superalgebras gl(m|n) and q(n), but maybe this will also be useful for the other classical and affine Lie superalgebras.
