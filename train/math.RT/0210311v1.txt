It is shown that there is an order isomorphism \phi' from the poset V of B\times B-orbits on the wonderful compactification of a semi-simple adjoint group G with Weyl group W to an interval in reverse Chevalley-Bruhat order on a non-canonically associated Coxeter group \hat{W} (in general neither finite nor affine). Moreover, \phi' preserves the corresponding Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. Springer's (partly conjectural) construction of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for the analogues of V for general Coxeter groups W is completed by reducing it by a similar order isomorphism to known results involving a ``twisted'' Chevalley-Bruhat order on \hat{W}.
