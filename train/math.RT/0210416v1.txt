Consider a complex classical semi-simple Lie group along with the set of its nilpotent coadjoint orbits. When the group is of type A, the set of orbital varieties contained in a given nilpotent orbit is described a set of standard Young tableaux. We parameterize both, the orbital varieties and the irreducible components of unipotent varieties in the other classical groups by sets of standard domino tableaux. The main tools are Spaltenstein's results on signed domino tableaux together with Garfinkle's operations on standard domino tableaux.
