We characterize, in a purely algebraic manner, certain linear forms, called stable, on a Lie algebra. As an application, we determine the index of a Borel subalgebra of a semi-simple Lie algebra. Finally, we give an example of a parabolic subalgebra of a semi-simple Lie algebra which does not admit any stable linear form.
