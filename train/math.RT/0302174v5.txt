We introduce a categorical framework for the study of representations of G_F, where G is a reductive group, and \bF is a 2-dimensional local field, i.e. F=K((t)), where K is a local field. Our main result says that the space of functions on G_F, which is an object of a suitable category of representations of G_F with the respect to the action of G_F on itself by left translations, becomes a representation of a certain central extension of G_F, when we consider the action by right translations.
