Let W be a finite Coxeter group. In this paper, we show that the properties of the Solomon algebra homomorphism Phi (from the Solomom descent algebra to the algebra of class functions) are strongly related to enumerative results: certain joint statistics on W may be enumerated by the scalar products of appropriate characters.
