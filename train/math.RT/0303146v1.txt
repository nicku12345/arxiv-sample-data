Rapoport and Kottwitz defined the affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties X_{\tilde{w}}^P(b\sigma) of a quasisplit connected reductive group G over F = \mathbb{F}_q((t)) for a parahoric subgroup P. They asked which pairs (b, \tilde{w}) give non-empty varieties, and in these cases what dimensions do these varieties have. This paper answers these questions for P=I an Iwahori subgroup, in the cases b=1, G=SL_2, SL_3, Sp_4. This information is used to get a formula for the dimensions of the X_{\tilde{w}}^K(\sigma) (all shown to be non-empty by Rapoport and Kottwitz) for the above G that supports a general conjecture of Rapoport. Here K is a special maximal compact subgroup.
