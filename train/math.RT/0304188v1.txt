I give a survey of joint work with Henrik Schlichtkrull on the induction of certain relations among (partial) Eisenstein integrals for the minimal principal series of a reductive symmetric space. I explain the application of this principle of induction to the proofs of a Fourier inversion formula and a Paley-Wiener theorem. Finally, the relation with the Plancherel decomposition is discussed.
