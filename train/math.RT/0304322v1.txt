Let G be a reductive group in the Harish-Chandra class e.g. a connected semisimple Lie group with finite center, or the group of real points of a connected reductive algebraic group defined over \R. Let \sigma be an involution of the Lie group G, H an open subgroup of the subgroup of fixed points of \sigma. One decomposes the elements of L^2(G/H) with the help of joint eigenfunctions under the algebra of left invariant differential operators under G on G/H.
