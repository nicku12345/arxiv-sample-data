In this talk we discuss the relations between representations of algebraic groups and principal bundles on algebraic varieties, especially in characteristic p. We quickly review the notions of stable and semistable vector bundles and principal G-bundles, where G is any semisimple group. We define the notion of a low height representation in characteristic p and outline a proof of the theorem that a bundle induced from a semistable bundle by a low height representation is again semistable. We include applications of this result to the following questions in characteristic p: 1) Existence of the moduli spaces of semistable G-bundles on curves. 2) Rationality of the canonical parabolic for nonsemistable principal bundles on curves. 3) Luna's etale slice theorem. We outline an application of a recent result of Hashimoto to study the singularities of the moduli spaces in (1) above, as well as when these spaces specialize correctly from characteristic 0 to characteristic p. We also discuss the results of Laszlo-Beauville-Sorger and Kumar-Narasimhan on the Picard group of these spaces. This is combined with the work of Hara and Srinivas-Mehta to show that these moduli spaces are F-split for p very large. We conclude by listing some open problems, in particular the problem of refining the bounds on the primes involved.
