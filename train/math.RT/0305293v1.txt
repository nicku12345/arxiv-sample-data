In this paper, we generalize a result by Berman and Billig on weight modules over Lie algebras with polynomial multiplication. More precisely, we show that a highest weight module with an exp-polynomial ``highest weight'' has finite dimensional weight spaces. We also get a class of irreducible weight modules with finite dimensional weight spaces over generalized Virasoro algebras which do not occur over the classical Virasoro algebra.
