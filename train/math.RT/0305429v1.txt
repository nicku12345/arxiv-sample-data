The centralizer algebra of the action of the unitary group on the real tensor powers of its natural module, is described by means of a modification in the multiplication of the signed Brauer algebras.   The relationships of this algebra with the invariants for U(n), and with the decomposition of the above tensor powers into irreducible modules, is considered.
