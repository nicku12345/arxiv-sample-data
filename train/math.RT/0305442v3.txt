In this paper we give an effective method for finding a unique representative of each orbit of the adjoint and coadjoint action of the real affine orthogonal group on its Lie algebra. In both cases there are orbits which have a modulus that is different from the usual invariants for orthogonal groups. We find an unexplained bijection between adjoint and coadjoint orbits. As a special case, we classify the adjoint and coadjoint orbits of the Poincar\'{e} group.
