In previous work of Gow, Ohmori, Lusztig and the author, the Schur indices of all unipotent characters of finite groups of Lie type have been explicitly determined except for six cases in groups of type F_4, E_7 and E_8. In this paper, we show that the Schur indices of all cuspidal unipotent characters for type F_4 and E_8 are~1, assuming that the group is defined over a field of ``good'' characteristic. This settles four out of the six open cases. For type E_7, we show that the Schur indices are at most~2.
