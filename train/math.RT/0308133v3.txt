Let G be a rank n additive subgroup of \bC and \Vir[G] the corresponding Virasoro algebra of rank n. In the present paper, irreducible weight modules with finite dimensional weight spaces over \Vir[G] are completely determined. There are two different classes of them. One class consists of simple modules of intermediate series whose weight spaces are all 1-dimensional. The other is constructed by using intermediate series modules over a Virasoro subalgebra of rank n-1. The classification of such modules over the classical Virasoro algebra was obtained by O. Mathieu in 1992 using a completely different approach.
