We introduce a canonical Chern-Weil map for possibly non-commutative g-differential algebras with connection. Our main observation is that the generalized Chern-Weil map is an algebra homomorphism ``up to g-homotopy''. Hence, the induced map from invariant polynomials to the basic cohomology is an algebra homomorphism. As in the standard Chern-Weil theory, this map is independent of the choice of connection.   Applications of our results include: a conceptually easy proof of the Duflo theorem for quadratic Lie algebras, a short proof of a conjecture of Vogan on Dirac cohomology, generalized Harish-Chandra projections for quadratic Lie algebras, an extension of Rouviere's theorem for symmetric pairs, and a new construction of universal characteristic forms in the Bott-Shulman complex.
