We consider the action of a real linear algebraic group G on a smooth, real affine algebraic variety M\subset \R^n, and study the corresponding left regular G-representation on the Banach space C_0(M) of continuous, complex valued functions on M vanishing at infinity. We show that the differential structure of this representation is already completely characterized by the action of the Lie algebra \g of G on the dense subspace \P=\C[M] \cdot e^{-r^2}, where \C[M] denotes the algebra of regular functions of M and r the distance function in \R^n. We prove that the elements of this subspace constitute analytic vectors of the considered G-representation, and, using this fact, we construct discrete reducing series in C_0(M). In case that G is reductive, K a maximal compact subgroup, \P turns out to be a (\g,K)-module in the sense of Harish-Chandra and Lepowsky, and by taking suitable subquotients of \P, respectively C_0(M), one gets admissible (\g,K)-modules as well as K-finite Banach representations.
