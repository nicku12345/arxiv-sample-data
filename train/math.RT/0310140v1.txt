Let \frak g be a reductive Lie algebra over \bold C. We say that a \frak g-module M is a generalized Harish-Chandra module if, for some subalgebra \frak k \subset\frak g, M is locally \frak k-finite and has finite \frak k-multiplicities. We believe that the problem of classifying all irreducible generalized Harish-Chandra modules could be tractable. In this paper, we review the recent success with the case when \frak k is a Cartan subalgebra. We also review the recent determination of which reductive in \frak g subalgebras \frak k are essential to a classification. Finally, we present in detail the emerging picture for the case when \frak k is a principal 3-dimensional subalgebra.
