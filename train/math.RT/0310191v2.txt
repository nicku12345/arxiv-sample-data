If \Lambda  is an indecomposable, non maximal, symmetric order, then the idealizer of the radical \Gamma := \Id(J(\Lambda)) = J(\Lambda)^{#}  is the dual of the radical. If \Gamma  is hereditary then \Lambda  has a Brauer tree (under modest additional assumptions). Otherwise \Delta := \Id(J(\Gamma)) = (J(\Gamma)^2)^{#} . If \Lambda = \Z_p G for a p-group G\neq 1, then \Gamma  is hereditary iff G\cong C_p and otherwise [\Delta : \Lambda ] = p^2 | G/(G'G^p)| . For Abelian groups G, the length of the radical idealizer chain of \Z_pG is (n-a)(p^{a} - p^{a-1})+p^{a-1}, where p^n is the order and p^a the exponent of the Sylow p-subgroup of G.
