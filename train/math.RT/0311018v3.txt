Following ideas of Geck and Rouquier, we show that there exists a ``canonical basic set'' of Specht modules in bijection with the simple modules of Ariki-Koike algebras at roots of unity. Moreover, we determine the parametrization of this set and we give the consequences of these results on the representation theory of Ariki-Koike algebras.
