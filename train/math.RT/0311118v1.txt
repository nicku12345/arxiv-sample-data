We are interested in Poisson structures transverse to nilpotent adjoint orbits in a complex semi-simple Lie algebra, and we study their polynomial nature, introduced by R.Cushman and M.Roberts. Furthermore, in the case of sl(n), we construct some families of nilpotent orbits with quadratic transverse structures.
