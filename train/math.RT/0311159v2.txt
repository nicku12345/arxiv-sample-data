We approach the problem of obtaining branching rules from the point of view of dual reductive pairs. Specifically, we obtain a stable branching rule for each of 10 classical families of symmetric pairs. In each case, the branching multiplicities are expressed in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. Some of the formulas are classical and include, for example, Littlewood's restriction rule as a special case.
