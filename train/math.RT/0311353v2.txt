This paper concerns a class of orbital integrals in Lie algebras over p-adic fields. The values of these orbital integrals at the unit element in the Hecke algebra count points on varieties over finite fields. The construction, which is based on motivic integration, works both in characteristic zero and in positive characteristic. As an application, the Fundamental Lemma for this class of integrals is lifted from positive characteristic to characteristic zero. The results are based on a formula for orbital integrals as distributions inflated from orbits in the quotient spaces of the Moy-Prasad filtrations of the Lie algebra. This formula is established by Fourier analysis on these quotient spaces.
