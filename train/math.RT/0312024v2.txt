We consider the Lie-algebra of the group of diffeomorphisms of d-dimensional torus which is also known to be the algebra of derivations on a Laurent polynomial ring A in d commuting variables denoted by DerA. Larsson has constructed a large class of DerA modules based on gl_d modules which are also A modules. In this paper we prove that any irreducible (A, DerA) module with finite dimensional weight spaces has to come from Larsson's construction.
