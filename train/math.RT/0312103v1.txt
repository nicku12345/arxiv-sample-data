Over fields of characteristic zero, there are well known constructions of the irreducible representations, due to A Young, and of irreducible modules, called Specht modules, due to W Specht, for the symmetric groups S_{n} which are based on elegant combinatorial concepts connected with Young tableaux etc.(see, e.g.{\bf [13]}). James {\bf [12]} extended these ideas to construct irreducible representations and modules over arbitrary field. Al-Aamily, Morris and Peel {\bf [1]} showed how this construction could be extended cover the Weyl groups of type B_{n}. In {\bf [14]} Morris described a possible extension of James' work for Weyl groups in general. Later, the present author and Morris {\bf [8]} give an alternative generalisation of James' work which is an extended improvement and extension of the original approach suggested by Morris. We now give a possible extension of James' work for finite reflection groups in general.
