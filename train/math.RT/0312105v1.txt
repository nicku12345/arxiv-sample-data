The construction of all irreducible modules of the symmetric groups over an arbitrary field which reduce to Specht modules in the case of fields of characteristic zero is given by G.D.James. Hal{\i}c{\i}o\u{g}lu and Morris describe a possible extension of James' work for Weyl groups in general, where Young tableaux are interpreted in terms of root systems. In this paper we show how to construct submodules of Specht modules for Weyl groups.
