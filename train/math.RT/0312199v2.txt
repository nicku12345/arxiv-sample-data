We introduce the notion of a spectral character for finite-dimensional representations of affine algebras. These can be viewed as a suitable q=1 limit of the elliptic characters defined by Etingof and Moura for quantum affine algebras. We show that these characters determine blocks of the category of finite-dimensional modules for affine algebras. To do this we use the Weyl modules defined by Chari and Pressley and some indecomposable reducible quotient of the Weyl modules.
