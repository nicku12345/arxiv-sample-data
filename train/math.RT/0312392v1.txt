Following Lusztig, we consider a Coxeter group W together with a weight function L. This gives rise to the pre-order relation \leq_{L} and the corresponding partition of W into left cells. We introduce an equivalence relation on weight functions such that, in particular, \leq_{L} is constant on equivalent classes. We shall work this out explicitly for W of type F_4 and check that several of Lusztig's conjectures concerning left cells with unequal parameters hold in this case, even for those parameters which do not admit a geometric interpretation. The proofs involve some explicit computations using {\sf CHEVIE}.
