Let A be a k-algebra and G be a group acting on A. We show that G also acts on the Hochschild cohomology algebra HH^{\bullet}(A) and that there is a monomorphism of rings HH^{\bullet}(A)^G \hookrightarrow HH^{\bullet}(A[G]). That allows us to show the existence of a monomorphism from HH^{\bullet}(\widetilde{A})^G into HH^{\bullet}(A), where \widetilde{A} is a Galois covering with group G.
