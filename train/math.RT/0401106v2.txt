We review the Beilinson-Ginzburg construction of equivariant derived categories of Harish-Chandra modules, and introduce analogues of Zuckerman functors in this setting. They are given by an explicit formula, which works equally well in the case of modules with a given infinitesimal character, which is important if one wants to apply Beilinson-Bernstein localization. We also show how to recover the usual Zuckerman functors from the equivariant ones by passing to cohomology.
