We examine the reducibility of induced from discrete series representations of SU_n over a p--adic field of characteristic zero. Some results are given for groups sharing derived group. We give a relationship between the R-groups for U)n and SU_n. Nonabelian R-groups are discussed. Elliptic representations are examined and in the generic case we give an explicit description f those L--packets containing non-discrete elliptic tempered representations. We exhibit L--packets containing both elliptic and non-elliptic components.
