The main result of this announcement is a formula for the tensor product of the class of a homogeneous line bundle with a Schubert class, expressed as a K(X)-linear combination of Schubert classes. We believe that this formula is the most general uniform result in the intersection theory of Schubert classes: it is related to a recent result of Fulton and Lascoux who presented a similar formula for a GL_n(C)/B-bundle. Indeed, in this case, their formula and ours coincide once one knows how to translate between their combinatorics with tableaux and ours with Littelmann paths. O. Mathieu has also proved the positivity which is implied by our formula. Applying the Chern character to our formula, and equating the lowest order terms we obtain a relative version of the classical result of Chevalley alluded to in the title of this paper.
