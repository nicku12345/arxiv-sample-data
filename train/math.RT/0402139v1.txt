Let G_\C be a connected, linear algebraic group defined over \R, acting regularly on a finite dimensional vector space V_\C over \C with \R-structure V_\R. Assume that V_\C posseses a Zariski-dense orbit, so that (G_\C,\rho,V_\C) becomes a prehomogeneous vector space over \R. We consider the left regular representation \pi of the group of \R-rational points G_\R on the Banach space \Cvan(V_\R) of continuous functions on V_\R vanishing at infinity, and study the convolution operators \pi(f), where f is a rapidly decreasing function on the identity component of G_\R. Denote the complement of the dense orbit by S_\C, and put S_\R=S_\C\cap V_\R. It turns out that the restriction of \pi(f) to V_\R-S_\R is a smooth operator. Furthermore, if G_\C is reductive, and S_\C and S_\R are irreducible hypersurfaces, \pi(f) corresponds, on each connected component of V_\R-S_\R, to a totally characteristic pseudodifferential operator. We then investigate the restriction of the Schwartz kernel of \pi(f) to the diagonal. It defines a distribution on V_\R-S_\R given by some power |p(m)|^s of a relative invariant p(m) of (G_\C,\rho,V_\C) and, as a consequence of the fundamental theorem of prehomogeneous vector spaces, its extension to V_\R, and the complex s-plane, satisfies functional equations. A trace of \pi(f) can then be defined by subtracting the singular contributions of the poles of the meromorphic extension.
