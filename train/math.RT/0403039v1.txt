Let G be a finite reductive group defined over a finite field F_q. In the case where G is a special linear group, we compute the multiplicities of irreducible characters of G(F_{q^2}) with the character of G(F_{q^2}) induced from the trivial character of G(F_q). We discuss the relationship between these multiplicities with the theory of Shintani descent for finite reductive groups in general. We also give some formula concerning the decomposition of the character of G(F_{q^r}) induced from the trivial character of G(F_q) for reductive groups G with any positive integer r.
