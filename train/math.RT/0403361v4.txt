Let G be the linear algebraic group SL_3 over a field k of characteristic two. Let A be a finitely generated commutative k-algebra on which G acts rationally by k-algebra automorphisms. We show that the full cohomology ring H^*(G,A) is finitely generated. This extends the finite generation property of the ring of invariants A^G. We discuss where the problem stands for other geometrically reductive group schemes.
