We study non-trivial deformations of the natural imbedding of the Lie algebra \fh_1 of lower triangular matrices (the Heisenberg Lie algebra) into gl(3,\mathbb{K}), where \mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R} or |mathbb{C}. Our first result is the calculation of the first cohomology space H^1(\fh_1;gl(3,\mathbb{K})). We prove that there are no obstructions for integrability of infinitesemal deformation and, furthermore, give an explicit formula for the most general deformation.
