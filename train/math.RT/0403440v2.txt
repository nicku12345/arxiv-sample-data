Let G be a connected semisimple Lie group with a finite center, with a maximal compact subgroup K. There are two general methods to construct representations of G, namely, ordinary parabolic induction and cohomological parabolic induction. We define Eisenstein integrals relative to cohomological inductions which generalize Flensted-Jensen's fundamental functions for discrete series. They are analogous to Harish-Chandra's Eisenstein integrals related to ordinary inductions. We introduce the notion of Li positivity of a K type in a representation of G which is extremely useful in the study of branching laws. As an application of our integral, we show that the minimal K types of many interesting representations are Li positive. These include all irreducible unitary representations with nonzero cohomology.
