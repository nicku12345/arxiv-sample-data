Let H_k(W,q) be the Iwahori--Hecke algebra associated with a finite Weyl group W, where k is a field and 0 \neq q \in k. Assume that the characteristic of k is not ``bad'' for W and let e be the smallest i \geq 2 such that 1+q+q^2+... +q^{i-1}=0. We show that the number of simple H_k(H,q)-modules is ``generic'', i.e., it only depends on e. The proof uses some computations in the {\sf CHEVIE} package of {\sf GAP} and known results due to Dipper--James, Ariki--Mathas, Rouquier and the author.
