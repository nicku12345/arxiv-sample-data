The index of a complex Lie algebra is the minimal codimension of its coadjoint orbits. Let us suppose \g semisimple, then its index, {\rm ind} \g, is equal to its rank, {\rm rk \g}. The goal of this paper is to establish a simple general formula for the index of \n(\g^{\xi}), for \xi nilpotent, where \n(\g^{\xi}) is the normaliser in \g of the centraliser \g^{\xi} of \xi. More precisely, we have to show the following result, conjectured by D. Panyushev \cite{Panyushev} : {\rm ind} \n(\g^{\xi}) = {\rm rk \g}-\dim \z(\g^{\xi}), where \z(\g^{\xi}) is the center of \g^{\xi}. D. Panyushev obtained in \cite{Panyushev} the inequality \hbox{{\rm ind} \n(\g^{\xi}) \geq {\rm rg \g}-\dim \z(\g^{\xi})} and we show that the maximality of the rank of a certain matrix with entries in the symmetric algebra {\cal S}(\g^{\xi}) implies the other inequality. The main part of this paper consists of the proof of the maximality of the rank of this matrix.
