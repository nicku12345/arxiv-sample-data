Let G be a real simple Lie group, \got g its Lie algebra. Given a nilpotent adjoint G-orbit O, the question is to determine the irreducible unitary representations of G that we can associate to O, according to the orbit method. P.Torasso, in [22], gave a method to solve this problem if O is minimal. In this paper, we study the case where O is any spherical nilpotent orbit of sl_n({\mathbb R}), we construct, from O, a family of representations of the two-sheeted covering of SL_n({\mathbb R}) with Torasso's method and, finally, we show that all these representations are associated to the corresponding orbit.
