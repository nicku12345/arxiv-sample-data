Starting from Jacobi-Trudi's type determinental expressions for the Schur functions corresponding to types B,C and D, we define a natural q-analogue of the multiplicity [V(\lambda):M(\mu)] when M(\mu) is a tensor product of row or column shaped modules defined by \mu. We prove that these q-multiplicities are equal to certain Kostka-Foulkes polynomials related to the root systems C or D. Finally we derive formulas expressing the associated multiplicities in terms of Kostka numbers.
