The main goal of this paper is to prove the following theorem:   Let \frak k be an \frak {sl}_2-subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra \frak g, none of whose simple factors is of type A1. Then there exists a positive integer b(\frak k, \frak g), such that for every irreducible finite dimensional \frak g-module V, there exists an injection of \frak k-modules W \to V, where W is an irreducible \frak k-module of dimension less than b(\frak k, \frak g).   This result was announced in math.RT/0310140.
