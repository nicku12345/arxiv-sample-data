The unipotent variety of a reductive algebraic group G plays an important role in the representation theory. In this paper, we will consider the closure \bar{\Cal U} of the unipotent variety in the De Concini-Procesi compactification \bar{G} of a connected simple algebraic group G. We will prove that \bar{\Cal U}-\Cal U is a union of some G-stable pieces introduced by Lusztig in \cite{L4}. This was first conjectured by Lusztig. We will also give an explicit description of \bar{\Cal U}. It turns out that similar results hold for the closure of any Steinberg fiber in \bar{G}.
