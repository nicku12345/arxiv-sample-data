Following ideas of van Dijk and Hille we study the link which exists between maximal degenerate representations and Berezin kernels. We consider the conformal group {\rm Conf}(V) of a simple real Jordan algebra V. The maximal degenerate representations \pi_s (s\in {\mathbb C}) we shall study are induced by a character of a maximal parabolic subgroup \bar P of {\rm Conf}(V). These representations \pi_s can be realized on a space I_s of smooth functions on V. There is an invariant bilinear form {\mathfrak B}_s on the space I_s. The problem we consider is to diagonalize this bilinear form {\mathfrak B}_s, with respect to the action of a symmetric subgroup G of the conformal group {\rm Conf}(V). This bilinear form can be written as an integral involving the Berezin kernel B_{\nu}, an invariant kernel on the Riemannian symmetric space G/K, which is a Makarevich symmetric space in the sense of Bertram. Then we can use results by van Dijk and Pevzner who computed the spherical Fourier transform of B_{\nu}. From these, one deduces that the Berezin kernel satisfies a remarkable Bernstein identity : D(\nu)B_{\nu} =b(\nu)B_{\nu +1}, where D(\nu) is an invariant differential operator on G/K and b(\nu) is a polynomial. By using this identity we compute a Hua type integral which gives the normalizing factor for an intertwining operator from I_{-s} to I_s. Furthermore we obtain the diagonalization of the invariant bilinear form with respect to the action of the maximal compact group U of the conformal group {\rm Conf}(V).
