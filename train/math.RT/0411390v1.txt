Let S(m|n,d) be the Schur superalgebra whose supermodules correspond to the polynomial representations of the supergroup GL(m|n) of degree d. In this paper we determine the representation type of these algebras (i.e. classify the ones which are semisimple, have finite, tame and wild representation type). Moreover, we prove that these algebras are in general not quasi-hereditary and have infinite global dimension.
