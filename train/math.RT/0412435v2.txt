Let G be the group of F-points of a reductive group defined over F, \sigma a rational involution of this group defined over F and H the group of fixed points of \sigma . We built rational families of H-fixed vectors in the dual of generalized principal series, using smooth homology of groups. Results of A.G.Helminck,S.P.Wang and A.G.Helminck,G.F.Helminck on the structure of \mathbb F-varieties are also essential.
