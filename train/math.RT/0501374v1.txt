Antimonotonous quadratic forms generalizing P-faithful posets defined by authors earlier are introduced. The criterion of antimonotonousness is given for posets with positive semidefinite quadratic forms. As consequence the new proofs of the criterions of finite representativity and tameness of posets are given.
