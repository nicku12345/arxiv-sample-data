For certain negative rational numbers k0, called singular values, and associated with the symmetric group S_N on N objects, there exist homogeneous polynomials annihilated by each Dunkl operator when the parameter k = k0. It was shown by de Jeu, Opdam and the author (TAMS 346(1994),237-256) that the singular values are exactly the values m/n with 2<=n<=N, m = 1,2... and m/n is not an integer. For each pair (m,n) satisfying these conditions there is a unique irreducible S_N-module of singular polynomials for the singular value -m/n. The existence of these polynomials was established by the author (IMRN 2004,#67,3607-3635). The uniqueness is proven in the present paper. By using Murphy's (J. Alg. 69(1981), 287-297) results on the eigenvalues of the Murphy elements, the problem of existence of singular polynomials is first restricted to the isotype of a partition of N (corresponding to an irreducible representation of S_N) such that (n/gcd(m,n)) divides t+1 for each part t of the partition except the last one. Then by arguments involving nonsymmetric Jack polynomials it is shown that the assumption that the second part of the partition is greater than or equal to n/gcd(m,n) leads to a contradiction.This shows that the singular polynomials are exactly those already determined.
