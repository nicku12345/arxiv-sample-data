In this paper, we prove Lusztig's conjecture for finite special linear groups, i.e., we show that characteristic functions of character sheaves coincide with almost characters up to scalar constants, under the condition that the characteristic of the base field is not too small. We determine those scalars explicitly. Our result gives a method of computing irreducible characters of these groups.
