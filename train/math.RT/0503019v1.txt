In \cite{indice}, we show the following result, conjectured by D. Panyushev \cite{Panyushev}, for \g a semisimple Lie algebra: {\rm ind} \n(\g^{e}) = {\rm rk} \g-\dim \z(\g^{e}, where \n(\g^{e}) and \z(\g^{e}) are, respectively, the normaliser and the centre of the centraliser \g^{e} of a nilpotent element e. This result is proved in \cite{indice} when \g is a classical simple Lie algebra and when e satisfies a certain property (P). We present in this paper the computations, made using GAP4, which prove that distinguished, non-regular, nilpotent orbits in E\_6, E\_7, E\_8 and F\_4 satisfy the property (P). This work completes the proof, presented in \cite{indice}, of the equality (\ref{princ}). The complete proof of this result was already presented in \cite{indice\_arxiv}.
