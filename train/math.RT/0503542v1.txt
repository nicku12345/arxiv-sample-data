We first review some invariant theoretic results about the finite subgroups of SU(2) in a quick algebraic way by using the McKay correspondence and quantum affine Cartan matrices. By the way it turns out that some parameters (a,b,h;p,q,r) that one usually associates with such a group and hence with a simply-laced Coxeter-Dynkin diagram have a meaningful definition for the non-simply-laced diagrams, too, and as a byproduct we extend Saito's formula for the determinant of the Cartan matrix to all cases. Returning to invariant theory we show that for each irreducible representation i of a binary tetrahedral, octahedral, or icosahedral group one can find a homomorphism into a finite complex reflection group whose defining reflection representation restricts to i.
