This is an expository article on representation theory of toroidal Lie algebras. We summerize all the results on representation theory of toroidal Lie algebras obtained in the last fifteen years. Apart from that a natural genaralization of Virasoro Lie algebra is introduced and the related results are stated. A genaralization of the semi direct product of affine Lie algebra and Virasoro Lie algebra is introduced which we call the full toroidal Lie algebra. The connection to the theory of Extended Affine Lie Algebras is explained.
