We give explicit presentations by generators and relations of certain generalized Schur algebras (associated with tensor powers of the natural representation) in types B, C, D. This extends previous results in type A obtained by two of the authors. The presentation is compatible with the Serre presentation of the corresponding universal enveloping algebra. In types C, D this gives a presentation of the corresponding classical Schur algebra (the image of the representation on a tensor power) since the classical Schur algebra coincides with the generalized Schur algebra in those types. This coincidence between the generalized and classical Schur algebra fails in type B, in general.
