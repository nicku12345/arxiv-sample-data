In this paper, we study the Kazhdan--Lusztig cells of a Coxeter group W in a ``relative'' setting, with respect to a parabolic subgroup W_I \subseteq W. This relies on a factorization of the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis \{C_w\} of the corresponding (multi-parameter) Iwahori--Hecke algebra with respect to W_I. We obtain two applications to the ``asymptotic case'' in type B_n, as introduced by Bonnaf\'e--Iancu: we show that \{C_w\} is a ``cellular basis'' in the sense of Graham--Lehrer, and we construct an analogue of Lusztig's canonical isomorphism from the Iwahori--Hecke algebra to the group algebra of the underlying Weyl group of type B_n.
