We describe the structure of a Verma module with a generic highest weight at the critical level over a symmetrizable affine Lie superalgebra not of the type A(2k,2l)^{(4)}. We obtain the character formula for a simple module with a generic highest weight at the critical level conjectured by V. G. Kac and D. A. Kazhdan.
