The Iwasawa decomposition \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k}_0 \oplus \hat{\mathfrak{a}}_0 \oplus \mathfrak{n}_0 of the real semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}_0 comes from its Cartan decomposition \mathfrak{g}_0=\mathfrak{k}_0 \oplus \mathfrak{p}_0. Then we get \mathfrak{g}_0=\mathfrak{k}_0 \oplus \mathfrak{b}_0 where \mathfrak{b}_0=\hat{\mathfrak{a}}_0 \oplus \mathfrak{n}_0. The question of knowing if the index were additive in the decomposition \mathfrak{g}_0=\mathfrak{k}_0 \oplus \mathfrak{b}_0 goes back M. Ra\"{i}s \cite{Rais}. In \cite{Moreau3}, I wrote that the index always is additive for this decomposition. Precisly, I claim that the index of \mathfrak{b} is given by the following formula : {\rm ind} \mathfrak{b} = {\rm rk \} \mathfrak{g} - {\rm rk \} \mathfrak{k}, where \mathfrak{b} is the complexification of \mathfrak{b}_0. This result is false in general. We actually have an inequality : {\rm ind} \mathfrak{b} \geq {\rm rg \} \mathfrak{g} - {\rm rg \} \mathfrak{k}. The goal of this paper is to correct this mistake. We resume the approach of \cite{Moreau3} to obtain this time the previous inequality. Then we give in more a characterization of the semisimple real Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}_0 for which the index is additive in the decomposition \mathfrak{g}_0=\mathfrak{k}_0 \oplus \mathfrak{b}_0. Moreover, we study in this paper the quasi-reductive character of some subalgebras of \mathfrak{g}. This is a new part in comparison with \cite{Moreau3}.
