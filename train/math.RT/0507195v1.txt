We show that the support of a simple weight module over the Virasoro algebra, which has an infinite-dimensional weight space, coincides with the weight lattice and that all non-trivial weight spaces of such module are infinite dimensional. As a corollary we obtain that every simple weight module over the Virasoro algebra, having a non-trivial finite-dimensional weight space, is a Harish-Chandra module (and hence is either a simple highest or lowest weight module or a simple module from the intermediate series). This implies positive answers to two conjectures about simple pointed and simple mixed modules over the Virasoro algebra.
