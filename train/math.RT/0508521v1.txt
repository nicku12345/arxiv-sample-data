This paper surveys, and in some cases generalises, many of the recent results on homomorphisms and the higher Ext groups for q-Schur algebras and for the Hecke algebra of type A. We review various results giving isomorphisms between Ext groups in the two categories, and discuss those cases where explicit results have been determined.
