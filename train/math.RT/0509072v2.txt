We study minimal degenerations between preprojective modules over wild quivers. Asymptotic properties of such degenerations are studied, with respect to codimension and numbers of indecomposable direct summands. We provide families of minimal disjoint degenerations of arbitrary codimension for almost all wild quivers and show that no such examples exist in the remaining cases.
