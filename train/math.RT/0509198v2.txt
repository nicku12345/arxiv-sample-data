We investigate the cluster-tilted algebras of finite representation type over an algebraically closed field. We give an explicit description of the relations for the quivers for finite representation type. As a consequence we show that a (basic) cluster-tilted algebra of finite type is uniquely determined by its quiver. Also some necessary conditions on the shapes of quivers of cluster-tilted algebras of finite representation type are obtained along the way.
