We explicitly describe the defining relations for simple Lie algebra of vector fields with polynomial coefficients and its subalgebras of divergence free, hamiltonian and contact vector fields, and for the Poisson algebra (realized on polynomials). We consider generators of these Lie algebras corresponding to the systems of simple roots associated with the standard grading of these algebras. (These systems of simple roots are distinguished in the sense of Penkov and Serganova.
