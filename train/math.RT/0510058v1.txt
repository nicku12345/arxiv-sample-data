Let g be a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra. Denote by \mathcal B the category of all bounded weight g-modules, i.e. those which are direct sum of their weight spaces and have uniformly bounded weight multiplicities. A result of Fernando shows that infinite-dimensional bounded weight modules exist only for g=sl(n) and g=sp(2n). If g=sp(2n) we show that \mathcal B has enough projectives if and only if n>1. In addition, the indecomposable projective modules can be parameterized and described explicitly. All indecomposable objects are described in terms of indecomposable representations of a certain quiver with relations. This quiver is wild for n>2. For n=2 we describe all indecomposables by relating the blocks of \mathcal B to the representations of the affine quiver A_3^{(1)}.
