In this paper, all irreducible weight modules with finite dimensional weight spaces over the twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra are determined. There are two different classes of them. One class is formed by simple modules of intermediate series, whose weight spaces are all 1-dimensional; the other class consists of the irreducible highest weight modules and lowest weight modules.
