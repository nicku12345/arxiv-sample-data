Adams and Conway have stated without proof a result which says, roughly speaking, that the representation ring R(G) of a compact, connected Lie group G is generated as a \lambda-ring by elements in 1-to-1 correspondance with the branches of the Dynkin diagram. In this note we present an elementary proof of this.
