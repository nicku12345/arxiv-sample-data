Let S(\Lambda) be the cyclotomic q-Schur algebra associated to the Ariki-Koike algebra H. We construct a certain subalgebra S^0(\Lambda) of S(\Lambda), and show that it is a standardly based algebra in the sense of Du and Rui. S^0(\Lambda) has a natural quotient \bar{S^0}(\Lambda), which turns out to be a cellular algebra. In the case where the modified Ariki-Koike algebra H^{\flat} is defined, \bar{S^0}(\Lambda) coincides with the cyclotomic q-Schur algebra associated to H^{\flat}. In this paper, we discuss a relationship among the decomposition numbers of S(\Lambda), S^0(\Lambda) and \bar{S^0}(\Lambda). In particular, we show that some important part of the decomposition matrix of S(\Lambda) coincides with a part of the decomposition matrix of \bar{S^0}(\Lambda).
