The structure of Lie algebras, Lie superalgebras and Leibniz algebras graded by finite root systems has been studied by several researchers since 1992. In this paper, we study the structure of Leibniz superalgebras graded by finite root systems, which gives an approach to study various classes of Leibniz superalgebras.
