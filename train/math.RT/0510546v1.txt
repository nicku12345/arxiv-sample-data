Dialgebras are generalizations of associative algebras which give rise to Leibniz algebras instead of Lie algebras. In this paper we study super dialgebras and Leibniz superalgebras, which are \z_2-graded dialgebras and Leibniz algebras. We also study universal central extesions of Leibniz superalgebras and obtain some results as in the case of Lie superalgebras. We determine universal central extensions of basic classical Lie superalgebras in the category of Leibniz superalgebras. They play a key role in studying Leibniz superalgebras graded by finite root systems.
