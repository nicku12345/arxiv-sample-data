Let \mathfrak{S}_\infty be the infinity permutation group and \Gamma an arbitrary group. Then \mathfrak{S}_\infty admits a natural action on \Gamma^\infty by automorphisms, so one can form a semidirect product \Gamma^\infty\rtimes \mathfrak{S}_\infty, known as the {\it wreath} product \Gamma\wr\mathfrak{S}_\infty of \Gamma by \mathfrak{S}_{\infty}. We obtain a full description of unitary II_1-factor-representations of \Gamma\wr\mathfrak{S}_\infty in terms of finite characters of \Gamma. Our approach is based on extending Okounkov's classification method for admissible representations of \mathfrak{S}_\infty\times\mathfrak{S}_\infty. Also, we discuss certain examples of representations of type II_1, where the {\it modular operator} of Tomita-Takesaki expresses naturally by the asymptotic operators, which are important in the characters-theory of infinite symmetric group.
