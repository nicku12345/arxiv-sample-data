The main aim of this paper is to associate to every cuspidal unipotent character of the Suzuki group its root of unity and to give a possible defintion of the Fourier matrix associated to the family of cuspidal unipotent characters of this group. We compute to this end the Shintani descents of Suzuki groups and use results of Digne and Michel.
