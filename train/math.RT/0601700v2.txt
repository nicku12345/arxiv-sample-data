As a consequence of Kirchberg's work, Connes' Embedding Conjecture is equivalent to the property that every homomorphism of the group F_\infty\times F_\infty into the unitary group U(\ell^2) with the strong topology is pointwise approximated by homomorphisms with a precompact range. In this form, the property (which we call Kirchberg's property) makes sense for an arbitrary topological group. We establish the validity of the Kirchberg property for the isometry group Iso(U) of the universal Urysohn metric space U as a consequence of a stronger result: every representation of a residually finite group by isometries of U can be pointwise approximated by representations with a finite range. This brings up the natural question of which other concrete infinite-dimensional groups satisfy the Kirchberg property.
