We show that the representation theory for the toroidal extended affine Lie algebras is controlled by a vertex operator algebra which is a tensor product of four VOAs: a sub-VOA of the hyperbolic lattice VOA, two affine VOAs and a Virasoro VOA. A tensor product of irreducible modules for these VOAs admits the structure of an irreducible module for the toroidal extended affine Lie algebra. We also show that for N=12, the sub-VOA of the hyperbolic lattice VOA becomes an exceptional irreducible module for the extended affine Lie algebra of rank 0.
