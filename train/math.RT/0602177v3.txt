We give a complete description of the graded multiplicity space which appears in the Feigin-Loktev fusion product [FL99] of graded Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules for all simple Lie algebras. This construction is used to obtain an upper bound formula for the fusion coefficients in these cases. The formula generalizes the case of g=A_r [AKS06], where the multiplicities are generalized Kostka polynomials [SW99,KS02]. In the case of other Lie algebras, the formula is the the fermionic side of the X=M conjecture [HKO+99]. In the cases where the Kirillov-Reshetikhin conjecture, regarding the decomposition formula for tensor products of KR-modules, has been been proven in its original, restricted form, our result provides a proof of the conjectures of Feigin and Loktev regarding the fusion product multiplicites.
