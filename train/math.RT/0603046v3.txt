Recently, there has been considerable progress in classifying the irreducible representations of Iwahori--Hecke algebras at roots of unity. Here, we present an application of these results to \ell-modular Harish--Chandra series for a finite group of Lie type G(q). Under some mild condition on \ell, we show that the \ell-modular principal series representations of G(q) are naturally parametrized by a {\em subset} of the set of complex irreducible characters of the Weyl group of G(q). We also show that this subset is ``generic'' in a precise sense.
