The paper presents a subclass of the class of MD5-algebras and MD5-groups, i.e., five dimensional solvable Lie algebras and Lie groups such that their orbits in the co-adjoint representation (K-orbit) are orbit of zero or maximal dimension. The main results of the paper is the classification up to an isomorphism of all MD5-algebras \mathcal{G} with the derived ideal {\mathcal{G}}^{1} := [\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{G}] is a 3-dimensional commutative Lie algebra.
