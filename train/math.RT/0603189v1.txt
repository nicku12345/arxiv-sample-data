We show how to extend the theory of generalized Reynolds ideals, as introduced by B. K"ulshammer, from symmetric algebras to arbitrary finite-dimensional algebras (in positive characteristic). This provides new invariants of the derived module categories of finite-dimensional algebras, extending recent results by the third author for symmetric algebras.
