Let F be an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from 2. We show that every nonsingular skew-symmetric n by n matrix X over F is orthogonally similar to a bidiagonal skew-symmetric matrix. In the singular case one has to allow some 4-diagonal blocks as well. If further the characteristic is 0, we construct the normal form for O_n(F)-similarity classes of skew-symmetric matrices. In this case the known normal forms (as presented in the well known book by Gantmacher) are quite different.   Finally we study some related varieties of matrices. We prove that the variety of normalized nilpotent n by n bidiagonal matrices for n=2s+1 is irreducible of dimension s. As a consequence the skew-symmetric nilpotent bidiagonal n by n matrices are shown to form a variety of pure dimension s.
