Using the notion of a Lagrangian covering, W. Graham and D. Vogan proposed a method of constructing representations from the coadjoint orbits for a complex semisimple Lie group G. When the coadjoint orbit \calO is nilpotent, a representation of G is attached to each orbital variety of \calO in this way. In the setting of classical groups, we show that whenever it is possible to carry out the Graham-Vogan construction for an orbital variety of a spherical \mathcal{O}, its infinitesimal character lies in a set of characters attached to \mathcal{O} by W. M. McGovern. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to carry out the Graham-Vogan construction for a sufficient number of orbital varieties to account for all the infinitesimal characters in this set.
