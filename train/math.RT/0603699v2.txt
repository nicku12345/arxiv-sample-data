From the irreducible decompositions' point of view, the structure of the cyclic GL_n-module generated by the \alpha-determinant degenerates when \alpha=\pm \frac1k (1\leq k\leq n-1). In this paper, we show that -\frac1k-determinant shares similar properties which the ordinary determinant possesses. From this fact, one can define a new (relative) invariant called a wreath determinant. Using (GL_m, GL_n)-duality in the sense of Howe, we obtain an expression of a wreath determinant by a certain linear combination of the corresponding ordinary minor determinants labeled by suitable rectangular shape tableaux. Also we study a wreath determinant analogue of the Vandermonde determinant, and then, investigate symmetric functions such as Schur functions in the framework of wreath determinants. Moreover, we examine coefficients which we call (n,k)-sign appeared at the linear expression of the wreath determinant in relation with a zonal spherical function of a Young subgroup of the symmetric group S_{nk}.
