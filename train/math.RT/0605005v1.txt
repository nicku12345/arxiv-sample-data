A new combinatorial interpretation of the Howe dual pair (\hat{\frak{gl}}_{\infty|\infty},\frak{gl}_n) acting on an infinite dimensional Fock space \frak{F}^n of level n is presented. The character of a quasi-finite irreducible highest weight representation of \hat{\frak{gl}}_{\infty|\infty} occurring in \frak{F}^n is realized in terms of certain bitableaux of skew shapes. We study a general combinatorics of these bitableaux, including Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence and Littlewood-Richardson rule, and then its dual relation with the rational semistandard tableaux for \frak{gl}_n. This result also explains other Howe dual pairs including \frak{gl}_n.
