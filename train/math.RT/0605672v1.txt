We obtain a connection between admissible elements for quadruples and Herrmann's endomorphisms. Herrmann constructed perfect elements s_n, t_n, p_{i,n} in D^4 by means of some endomorphisms and showed that these perfect elements coincide with the Gelfand-Ponomarev perfect elements modulo linear equivalence. We show that the admissible elements in D^4 are also obtained by means of Herrmann's endomorphisms \gamma_{ij}. Endomorphism \gamma_{ij} and the elementary map of Gelfand-Ponomarev \phi_i act, in a sense, in opposite directions, namely the endomorphism \gamma_{ij} adds the index to the start of the admissible sequence, and the elementary map \phi_i adds the index to the end of the admissible sequence.
