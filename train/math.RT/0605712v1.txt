This is an appendix to the Handbook of Tilting Theory, edited by Angeleri-Huegel, Happel and Krause, to be published soon. Part 1 of the appendix provides an outline of the core of tilting theory. Part 2 is devoted to topics where tilting modules and tilted algebras have shown to be relevant. Both Parts 1 and 2 contain historical annodations and reminiscences. The final Part 3 is a short report on some striking recent developments which are motivated by the cluster theory of Fomin and Zelevinsky. In particular, we will guide the reader to the basic properties of cluster tilted algebras, to the relationship between tilted algebras and cluster tilted algebras, but also to the cluster categories which provide a universal setting for all the related tilted and cluster tilted algebras. In addition, we will focus the attention to the complex of cluster tilting objects and exhibit an elementary description of this complex.
