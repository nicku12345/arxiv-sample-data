In a recent manuscript, D.Vogan conjectures that four canonical globalizations of Harish-Chandra modules commute with certain n-cohomology groups. In this article we focus on the case of a complex reductive group and prove that Vogan's conjecture holds for one of the globalizations if and only if it holds for the dual. We thus prove Vogan's conjecture for the maximal globalization if the reductive Lie group is complex and connected.
