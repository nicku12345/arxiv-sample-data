As a particular one parameter deformation of the quantum determinant, we introduce a quantum \alpha-determinant and study the \mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)-cyclic module generated by it: We show that the multiplicity of each irreducible representation in this cyclic module is determined by a certain polynomial called the q-content discriminant. A part of the present result is a quantum counterpart for the result of Matsumoto and Wakayama (2005), however, a new distinguished feature arises in our situation.
