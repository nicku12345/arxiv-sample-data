In this short note, we investigate the following question of Panyushev : ``Is the sum of the index of a parabolic subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} and the index of its nilpotent radical always greater than or equal to the rank of \mathfrak{g}?''. Using the formula for the index of parabolic subalgebras conjectured by Tauvel and the author, and proved by Millet-Fauquant and Joseph, we give a positive answer to this question. Moreover, we also obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for this sum to be equal to the rank of \mathfrak{g}. This provides new examples of direct sum decomposition of a semisimple Lie algebra verifying the ``index additivity condition'' as stated by Ra{\"\i}s.
