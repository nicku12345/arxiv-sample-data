Let G be a complex reductive group and let G^\vee be its Langlands dual. Let us choose a triangular decomposition \mathfrak g^\vee=\mathfrak n^\vee_-\oplus\mathfrak h^\vee\oplus\mathfrak n^\vee_+ of the Lie algebra G^\vee. Braverman, Finkelberg and Gaitsgory show that the set of all Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen cycles in the affine grassmannian \mathscr G=G\bigl(\mathbb C((t))\bigr)/G\bigl(\mathbb C[[t]]\bigr) is a crystal isomorphic to the crystal of the canonical basis of U(\mathfrak n^\vee_+). Starting from the string parameter of an element of the canonical basis, we give an explicit description of a dense subset of the associated MV cycle. As a corollary, we show that any MV cycle can be obtained as the closure of one of the varieties involved in Lusztig's algebraic-geometric parametrization of the canonical basis. In addition, we prove that the bijection between LS paths and MV cycles constructed by Gaussent and Littelmann is an isomorphism of crystals.
