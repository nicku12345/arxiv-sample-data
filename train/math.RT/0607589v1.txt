In the first part of this paper the projective dimension of the structural modules in the BGG category \mathcal{O} is studied. This dimension is computed for simple, standard and costandard modules. For tilting and injective modules an explicit conjecture relating the result to Lusztig's \mathbf{a}-function is formulated (and proved for type A). The second part deals with the extension algebra of Verma modules. It is shown that this algebra is in a natural way \mathbb{Z}^2-graded and that it has two \mathbb{Z}-graded Koszul subalgebras. The dimension of the space \mathrm{Ext}^1 into the projective Verma module is determined. In the last part several new classes of Koszul modules and modules, represented by linear complexes of tilting modules, are constructed.
