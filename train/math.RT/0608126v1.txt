We develop an approach to the character theory of certain classes of finite and profinite groups based on the construction of a Lie algebra associated to such a group, but without making use of the notion of a polarization which is central to the classical orbit method. Instead, Kirillov's character formula becomes the fundamental object of study. Our results are then used to produce an alternate proof of the orbit method classification of complex irreducible representations of p-groups of nilpotence class less than p, where p is a prime, and of continuous complex irreducible representations of uniformly powerful pro-p-groups (with a certain modification for p=2). As a main application, we give a quick and transparent proof of the p-adic analogue of Brown's theorem, stating that for a nilpotent Lie group over Q_p the Fell topology on the set of isomorphism classes of its irreducible representations coincides with the quotient topology on the set of its coadjoint orbits.
