In this paper we establish a connection between the cohomology of a modular Lie algebra and its p-envelopes. We also compute the cohomology of Zassenhaus algebras and their minimal p-envelopes with coefficients in generalized baby Verma modules and in simple modules over fields of characteristic p>2.
