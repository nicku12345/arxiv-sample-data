Let A be a finitary algebra over a finite field k, and A-mod the category of finite dimensional left A-modules. Let \mathcal{H}(A) be the corresponding Hall algebra, and for a positive integer r let D_{r}(A) be the subspace of \mathcal{H}(A) which has a basis consisting of isomorphism classes of modules in A-mod with at least r+1 indecomposable direct summands. If A is hereditary of type A_{n}, then D_{r}(A) is known to be the kernel of the map from the twisted Hall algebra to the quantized Schur algebra indexed by n+1 and r. For any A, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for D_{r}(A) to be an ideal and some conditions for D_{r}(A) to be a subring of \mathcal{H}(A). For A the path algebra of a quiver, we also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for D_{r}(A) to be a subring of \mathcal{H}(A).
