Let A be a symmetric k-algebra over a perfect field k. K\"ulshammer defined for any integer n a mapping \zeta\_n on the degree 0 Hochschild cohomology and a mapping \kappa\_n on the degree 0 Hochschild homology of A as adjoint mappings of the respective p-power mappings with respect to the symmetrizing bilinear form. In an earlier paper it is shown that \zeta\_n is invariant under derived equivalences. In the present paper we generalize the definition of \kappa\_n to higher Hochschild homology and show the invariance of \kappa and its generalization under derived equivalences. This provides fine invariants of derived categories.
