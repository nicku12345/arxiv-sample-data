We give a new (inductive) proof of the classical Frobenius--Young correspondence between irreducible complex representations of the symmetric group and Young diagrams, using the new approach, suggested in \cite{OV, VO}, to determining this correspondence. We also give linear relations between Kostka numbers that follow from the decomposition of the restrictions of induced representations to the previous symmetric subgroup. We consider a realization of representations induced from Young subgroups in polylinear forms and describe its relation to Specht modules.
