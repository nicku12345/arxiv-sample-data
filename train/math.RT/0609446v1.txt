These notes were written following lectures I had the pleasure of giving on this subject at Keio University, during November and December 2004. The first part is about new applications of Jordan algebras to the geometry of Hermitian symmetric spaces and to causal semi-simple symmetric spaces of Cayley type. The second part will present new contributions for studing (non commutative) Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions on Lie semi-groups which is a part of the so called Gelfand-Gindikin program.
