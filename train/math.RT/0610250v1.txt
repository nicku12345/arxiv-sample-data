This paper concerns regular connections on trivial algebraic G-principal fiber bundles over the infinitesimal punctured disc, where G is a connected reductive linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We show that the pull-back of every regular connection to an appropriate covering of the infinitesimal punctured disc is gauge equivalent to a connection of the form X z^{-1}dz for some X in the Lie algebra of G. We may even arrange that the only rational eigenvalue of ad X is zero. Our results allow a classification of regular SL_n-connections up to gauge equivalence.
