We introduce a notion of generalized Serre duality on a Hom-finite Krull-Schmidt triangulated category \mathcal{T}. This duality induces the generalized Serre functor on \mathcal{T}, which is a linear triangle equivalence between two thick triangulated subcategories of \mathcal{T}. Moreover, the domain of the generalized Serre functor is the smallest additive subcategory of \mathcal{T} containing all the indecomposable objects which appear as the third term of an Auslander-Reiten triangle in \mathcal{T}; dually, the range of the generalized Serre functor is the smallest additive subcategory of \mathcal{T} containing all the indecomposable objects which appear as the first term of an Auslander-Reiten triangle in \mathcal{T}.   We compute explicitly the generalized Serre duality on the bounded derived categories of artin algebras and of certain noncommutative projective schemes in the sense of Artin and Zhang. We obtain a characterization of Gorenstein algebras: an artin algebra A is Gorenstein if and only if the bounded homotopy category of finitely generated projective A-modules has Serre duality in the sense of Bondal and Kapranov.
