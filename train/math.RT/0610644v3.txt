Let V be a symplectic vector space over a finite or local field. We compute the character of the Weil representation of the metaplectic group Mp(V). The final formulas are overtly free of choices (e.g. they do not involve the usual choice of a Lagrangian subspace of V). Along the way, in results similar to those of K. Maktouf, we relate the character to the Weil index of a certain quadratic form, which may be understood as a Maslov index. This relation also expresses the character as the pullback of a certain simple function from Mp(V\oplus V).
