Let F be a finite extension of {\mathbb{Q}} \_p. Any dihedral supercuspidal representation of GL \_2 (K) arises from an admissible multiplicative character \omega of a quadratic extension L of K. We show that such a representation is distinguished for GL \_2 (F) if and only if L biquadratic over F and \omega restricted to invertibles of one of the two other quadratic extensions of F in L is trivial. We then observe a similar statement for the principal series and we study all dihedral representations.
