The preprints arXiv:math/0610728 and arXiv:math/0612451 are withdrawn due to a problem with Theorem 2.2 in arXiv:math/0610728.   The theorem claims that for certain triangulated categories with finitely many indecomposable objects, the Calabi-Yau dimension can be computed combinatorially, by finding the smallest d for which the Serre functor and the d'th power of the suspension functor have the same action on the Auslander-Reiten quiver.   This is false, and we are grateful to Alex Dugas for pointing out a counterexample; see Section 5 of his paper arXiv:math/0808.1311 for more details. Unfortunately, we are not presently able to come up with a corrected version of the theorem, and this means that we cannot compute the Calabi-Yau dimensions of concrete stable module categories. Since these dimensions are necessary for identifying the categories with higher cluster categories, we presently have no means to achieve such identifications.
