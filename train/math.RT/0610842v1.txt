We prove that the Fourier matrices for the imprimitive complex reflection groups introduced by Malle define fusion algebras with not necessarily positive but integer structure constants. Hence they define Z-algebras. As a result, we obtain that all known Fourier matrices belonging to spetses define algebras with integer structure constants.
