We construct families of irreducible representations for a class of quantum groups U_{q}(f_{m}(K,H). First, we realize these quantum groups as Hyperbolic algebras. Such a realization yields natural families of irreducible weight representations for U_{q}(f_{m}(K,H)). Second, we study the relationship between U_{q}(f_{m}(K,H)) and U_{q}(f_{m}(K)). As a result, any finite dimensional weight representation of U_{q}(f_{m}(K,H)) is proved to be completely reducible. Finally, we study the Whittaker model for the center of U_{q}(f_{m}(K,H)), and a classification of all irreducible Whittaker representations of U_{q}(f_{m}(K,H)) is obtained.
