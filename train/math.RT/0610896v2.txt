In this paper, we construct families of irreducible representations for a class of quantum groups U_{q}(f_{m}(K)). First, we give a natural construction of irreducible weight representations for U_{q}(f_{m}(K)) using methods in spectral theory developed by Rosenberg. Second, we study the Whittaker model for the center of U_{q}(f_{m}(K)). As a result, the structure of Whittaker representations is determined, and all irreducible Whittaker representations are explicitly constructed. Finally, we prove that the annihilator of a Whittaker representation is centrally generated.
