We study the minimal length elements in some double cosets of Coxeter groups and use them to study Lusztig's G-stable pieces and the generalization of G-stable pieces introduced by Lu and Yakimov. We also use them to study the minimal length elements in a conjugacy class of a finite Coxeter group and prove a conjecture in \cite{GKP}.
