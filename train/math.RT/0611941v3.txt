Let \cH be the one-parameter Hecke algebra associated to a finite Weyl group W, defined over a ground ring in which ``bad'' primes for W are invertible. Using deep properties of the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of \cH and Lusztig's \ba-function, we show that \cH has a natural cellular structure in the sense of Graham and Lehrer. Thus, we obtain a general theory of ``Specht modules'' for Hecke algebras of finite type. Previously, a general cellular structure was only known to exist in types A_n and B_n.
