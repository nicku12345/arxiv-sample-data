Let X be a character table of the symmetric group S_n. It is shown that unless n = 4 or n=6, there is a unique way to assign partitions of n to the rows and columns of X so that for all \lambda and \nu, X_{\lambda\nu} is equal to \chi^\lambda(\nu), the value of the irreducible character of S_n labelled by \lambda on elements of cycle type \nu. Analogous results are proved for alternating groups, and for the Brauer character tables of symmetric and alternating groups.
