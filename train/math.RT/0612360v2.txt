A regular A_n-crystal is an edge-colored directed graph, with n colors, related to an irreducible highest weight integrable module over U_q(sl_{n+1}). Based on Stembridge's local axioms for regular simply-laced crystals and a structural characterization of regular A_2-crystals in \cite{DKK-07}, we present a new combinatorial construction, the so-called {\em crossing model}, and prove that this model generates precisely the set of regular A_n-crystals.   Using the model, we obtain a series of results on the combinatorial structure of such crystals and properties of their subcrystals.
