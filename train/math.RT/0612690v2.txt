We give a new proof and an improvement of two Theorems of J. Alev, M.A. Farinati, T. Lambre and A.L. Solotar : the first one about Hochschild cohomology spaces of some twisted bimodules of the Weyl algebra W and the second one about Hochschild cohomology spaces of the smash product G * W (G a finite subgroup of SP(2n)), and as an application, we then give a new proof of a Theorem of P. Etingof and V. Ginzburg, which shows that the Symplectic Reflection Algebras are deformations of G * W (and, in fact, all possible ones).
