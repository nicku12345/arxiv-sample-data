Let G be a p-adic connected reductive group with Lie algebra g. For a parabolic subgroup P in G and a finite-dimensional locally analytic representation V of P, we study the induced locally analytic G-representation W = Ind^G_P(V). Our result is the following criterion concerning the topological irreducibility of W: if the Verma module U(g) \otimes_{U(p)} V' associated to the dual representation V' is irreducible then W is topologically irreducible as well.
