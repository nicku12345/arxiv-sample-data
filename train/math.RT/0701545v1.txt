In this paper, we calculate the space Ext^1_{GL(n)}(L_n(\lambda),L_n(\mu)), where GL(n) is the general linear group of degree n over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, L_n(\lambda) and L_n(\mu) are rational irreducible GL(n)-modules with highest weights \lambda and \mu respectively, the restriction of L_n(\lambda) to any Levi subgroup of GL(n) is semisimple, \lambda is a p-restricted weight and \mu does not strictly dominate \lambda.
