We investigate the Galois coverings of piecewise algebras and more particularly their behaviour under derived equivalences. Under a technical assumption which is satisfied if the algebra is derived equivalent to a hereditary algebra, we prove that there exists a universal Galois covering whose group of automorphisms is free and depends only on the derived category of the algebra. As a corollary, we prove that the algebra is simply connected if and only if its first Hochschild cohomology vanishes.
