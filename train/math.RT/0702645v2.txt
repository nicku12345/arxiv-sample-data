Following Feigin and Fuchs, we compute the first cohomology of the Lie superalgebra \mathcal{K}(1) of contact vector fields on the (1,1)-dimensional real superspace with coefficients in the superspace of linear differential operators acting on the superspaces of weighted densities. We also compute the same, but \mathfrak{osp}(1|2)-relative, cohomology. We explicitly give 1-cocycles spanning these cohomology. We classify generic formal \mathfrak{osp}(1|2)-trivial deformations of the \mathcal{K}(1)-module structure on the superspaces of symbols of differential operators. We prove that any generic formal \mathfrak{osp}(1|2)-trivial deformation of this \mathcal{K}(1)-module is equivalent to a polynomial one of degree \leq4. This work is the simplest superization of a result by Bouarroudj [On \mathfrak{sl}(2)-relative cohomology of the Lie algebra of vector fields and differential operators, J. Nonlinear Math. Phys., no.1, (2007), 112--127]. Further superizations correspond to \mathfrak{osp}(N|2)-relative cohomology of the Lie superalgebras of contact vector fields on 1|N-dimensional superspace.
