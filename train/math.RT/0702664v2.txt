We consider the action of the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields, \mathfrak{vect}(1), by the Lie derivative on the space of symbols \mathcal{S}_\delta^n=\bigoplus_{j=0}^n \mathcal{F}_{\delta-j}. We study deformations of this action. We exhibit explicit expressions of some 2-cocycles generating the second cohomology space \mathrm{H}^2_{\rm diff}(\mathfrak{vect}(1),{\cal D}_{\nu,\mu}) where {\cal D}_{\nu,\mu} is the space of differential operators from \mathcal{F}_\nu to \mathcal{F}_\mu. Necessary second-order integrability conditions of any infinitesimal deformations of \mathcal{S}_\delta^n are given. We describe completely the formal deformations for some spaces \mathcal{S}_\delta^n and we give concrete examples of non trivial deformations.
