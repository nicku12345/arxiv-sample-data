This paper presents categorifications of (right) cell modules and induced cell modules for Hecke algebras of finite Weyl groups. In type A we show that these categorifications depend only on the isomorphism class of the cell module, not on the cell itself. Our main application is multiplicity formulas for parabolically induced modules over a reductive Lie algebra of type A, which finally determines the so-called rough structure of generalized Verma modules. On the way we present several categorification results and give the positive answer to Kostant's problem from \cite{Jo} in many cases. We also give a general setup of decategorification, precategorification and categorification.
