We prove a conjecture by Dipper, James and Murphy that a bipartition is restricted if and only if it is Kleshchev. Hence the restricted bipartitions naturally label the crystal graphs of level two irreducible integrable \mathcal{U}_v({\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}_e})-modules and the simple modules of Hecke algebras of type B_n.
