We consider symmetric d-linear forms of dimension n over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0. The "center" of a form is the analogous of the space of symmetric matrices of a bilinear form. For d>2 the center is a commutative subalgebra of \mathbf{M}_n(k). The automorphism group of the form acts naturally on the center. We give a description of this group via this action.
