Dipper, James and Murphy generalized the classical Specht module theory to Hecke algebras of type B_n. On the other hand, for any choice of a monomial order on the parameters in type B_n, we obtain corresponding Kazhdan--Lusztig cell modules. In this paper, we show that the Specht modules are naturally equivalent to the Kazhdan--Lusztig cell modules {\em if} we choose the dominance order on the parameters, as in the ``asymptotic case'' studied by Bonnaf\'e and the second named author. We also give examples which show that such an equivalence does not hold for other choices of monomial orders.
