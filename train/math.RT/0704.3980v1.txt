We study cohomological induction for a pair (\frak g,\frak k), \frak g being an infinite dimensional locally reductive Lie algebra and \frak k \subset\frak g being of the form \frak k_0 + C_\gg(\frak k_0), where \frak k_0\subset\frak g is a finite dimensional reductive in \frak g subalgebra and C_{\gg} (\frak k_0) is the centralizer of \frak k_0 in \frak g. We prove a general non-vanishing and \frak k-finiteness theorem for the output. This yields in particular simple (\frak g,\frak k)-modules of finite type over \frak k which are analogs of the fundamental series of generalized Harish-Chandra modules constructed in \cite{PZ1} and \cite{PZ2}. We study explicit versions of the construction when \frak g is a root-reductive or diagonal locally simple Lie algebra.
