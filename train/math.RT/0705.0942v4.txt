For each simply-laced Dynkin graph \Delta we realize the simple complex Lie algebra of type \Delta as a quotient algebra of the complex degenerate composition Lie algebra L(A)_{1}^{\mathbb{C}} of a domestic canonical algebra A of type \Delta by some ideal I of L(A)_{1}^{\mathbb{C}} that is defined via the Hall algebra of A, and give an explicit form of I. Moreover, we show that each root space of L(A)_{1}^{\mathbb{C}}/I has a basis given by the coset of an indecomposable A-module M with root easily computed by the dimension vector of M.
