We introduce the class of modules of constant Jordan type for a finite group scheme G over a field k of characteristic p > 0. This class is closed under taking direct sums, tensor products, duals, Heller shifts and direct summands, and includes endotrivial modules. It contains all modules in an Auslander-Reiten component which has at least one module in the class. Highly non-trivial examples are constructed using cohomological techniques. We offer conjectures suggesting that there are strong conditions on a partition to be the Jordan type associated to a module of constant Jordan type.
