This paper generalizes the classification in a paper of Dimitrov and Penkov of Borel subalgebras of gl_infty. Root-reductive Lie algebras are direct limits of finite-dimensional reductive Lie algebras along inclusions preserving the root spaces with respect to nested Cartan subalgebras. A Borel subalgebra of a root-reductive Lie algebra is by definition a maximal locally solvable subalgebra. The main general result of this paper is that a Borel subalgebra of an infinite-dimensional indecomposable root-reductive Lie algebra is the simultaneous stabilizer of a certain type of generalized flag in each of the standard representations. For the three infinite-dimensional simple root-reductive Lie algebras more precise results are obtained. The map sending a maximal closed (isotropic) generalized flag in the standard representation to its stabilizer hits Borel subalgebras, yielding a bijection in the cases of sl_infty and sp_infty; in the case of so_infty the fibers are of size one and two. A description is given of a nice class of toral subalgebras contained in any Borel subalgebra. Finally, certain Borel subalgebras of a general root-reductive Lie algebra are seen to correspond bijectively with Borel subalgebras of the commutator subalgebra, which are understood in terms of the special cases.
