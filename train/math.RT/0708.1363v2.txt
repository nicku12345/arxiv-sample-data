We relate the partition-type parametrization of rational (arithmetic) nilpotent adjoint orbits of the split classical groups SL_n and Sp_{2n} over local non-Archimedean fields with a parametrization, introduced by DeBacker in 2002, which uses the associated Bruhat-Tits building to relate the question to one over the residue field.
