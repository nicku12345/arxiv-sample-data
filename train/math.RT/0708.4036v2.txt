This paper gives the classification of the Whittaker unitary dual for affine graded Hecke algebras of type E. By the Iwahori-Matsumoto involution, this is equivalent also to the classification of the spherical unitary dual for type E. This work completes the classification of the Whittaker Iwahori-spherical unitary dual, or equivalently, the spherical unitary dual, of split linear algebraic p-adic groups.
