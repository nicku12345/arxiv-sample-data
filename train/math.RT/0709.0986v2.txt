In this paper we study the second Hochschild cohomology group {HH}^2(\Lambda) of a finite dimensional algebra \Lambda. In particular, we determine {HH}^2(\Lambda) where \Lambda is a finite dimensional self-injective algebra of finite representation type over an algebraically closed field K and show that this group is zero for most such \Lambda; we give a basis for {HH}^2(\Lambda) in the few cases where it is not zero.
