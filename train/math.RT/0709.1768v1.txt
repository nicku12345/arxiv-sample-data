We compute the first cohomology spaces H^1(\mathfrak{osp}(1|2);\mathfrak{D}_{\lambda,\mu}) (\lambda, \mu\in\mathbb{R}) of the Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{osp}(1|2) with coefficients in the superspace \mathfrak{D}_{\lambda,\mu} of linear differential operators acting on weighted densities on the supercircle S^{1|1}. The structure of these spaces was conjectured in \cite{gmo}. In fact, we prove here that the situation is a little bit more complicated. (To appear in LMP.)
