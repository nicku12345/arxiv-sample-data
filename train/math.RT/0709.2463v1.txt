We prove that the problems of classifying triples of symmetric or skew-symmetric matrices up to congruence, local commutative associative algebras with zero cube radical and square radical of dimension 3, and Lie algebras with central commutator subalgebra of dimension 3 are hopeless since each of them reduces to the problem of classifying pairs of n-by-n matrices up to simultaneous similarity.
