Let F be a non-Archimedean locally compact field and let D be a central division algebra over F. Let \pi_1 and \pi_2 be respectively two smooth irreducible representations of {\rm GL}(n_1,D) and {\rm GL}(n_2,F), n_1, n_2 \geq 0. In this article, we give some sufficient conditions on \pi_1 and \pi_2 so that the parabolically induced representation of \pi_1 \otimes \pi_2 to {\rm GL}(n_1+n_2,D) has a unique irreducible quotient. In the case where \pi_1 is a cuspidal representation, we compute the Zelevinsky's parameters of such a quotient in terms of parameters of \pi_2. This is the key point for making explicit Howe correspondence for dual pairs of type II.
