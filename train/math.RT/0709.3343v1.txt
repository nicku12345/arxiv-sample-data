In this paper we give a simpler proof of the L^p-Schwartz space isomorphism (0< p\leq 2) under the Fourier transform for the class of functions of left \delta-type on a Riemannian symmetric space of rank one. Our treatment rests on Anker's \cite{A} proof of the corresponding result in the case of left K-invariant functions on X. Thus we give a proof which relies only on the Paley--Wiener theorem.
