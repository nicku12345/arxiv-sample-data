Ariki's and Grojnowski's approach to the representation theory of affine Hecke algebras of type A is applied to type B with unequal parameters to obtain -- under certain restrictions on the eigenvalues of the lattice operators -- analogous multiplicity-one results and a classification of irreducibles with partial branching rules as in type A.
