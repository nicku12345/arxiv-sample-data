In this article, we give a new method for proving Howe correspondence in the case of dual pairs of type ({\rm GL}_n, {\rm GL}_m) over a non-Archimedean locally compact field F. The proof consists in combining a study on Kudla's filtration with the results of a previous article of the autor about the irreducibility of a parabolically induced representation. The proof is valid for F of any characteristic and allows us to make the correspondence explicit in terms of Langlands parameters.
