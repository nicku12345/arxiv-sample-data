This paper presents new generators for the center of the universal enveloping algebra of the symplectic Lie algebra. These generators are expressed in terms of the column-permanent, and it is easy to calculate their eigenvalues on irreducible representations. We can regard these generators as the counterpart of central elements of the universal enveloping algebra of the orthogonal Lie algebra given in terms of the column-determinant by A. Wachi. The earliest prototype of all these central elements is the Capelli determinants in the universal enveloping algebra of the general linear Lie algebra.
