Following the definition of Rouquier for the "families of characters" of a Weyl group and its generalization to the case of complex reflection groups, already appeared in the works of Broue-Kim and Malle-Rouquier, we show that these "families" depend on a numerical datum of the group, its "essential hyperplanes". Using this characterization, we provide the algorithm and the results of the determination of the Rouquier blocks of the cyclotomic Hecke algebras of all exceptional complex reflection groups.
