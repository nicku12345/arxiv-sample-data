Let \gg be a complex reductive Lie algebra and \kk\subset\gg be any reductive in \gg subalgebra. We call a (\gg,\kk)-module M bounded if the \kk-multiplicities of M are uniformly bounded. In this paper we initiate a general study of simple bounded (\gg,\kk)-modules. We prove a strong necessary condition for a subalgebra \kk to be bounded (Corollary \ref{cor1.6}), i.e. to admit an infinite-dimensional simple bounded (\gg,\kk)-module, and then establish a sufficient condition for a subalgebra \kk to be bounded (Theorem \ref{thGroups2}). As a result we are able to classify all maximal bounded reductive subalgebras of \gg=\sl(n).   In the second half of the paper we describe in detail simple bounded infinite-dimensional (\gg,\sl(2))-modules, and in particular compute their characters and minimal \sl(2)-types. We show that if \sl(2) is a bounded subalgebra of \gg which is not contained in a proper ideal of \gg, then \gg\simeq \sl(2)\oplus \sl(2), \sl(3),\sp(4); alltogether, up to conjugation there are five possible embeddings of \sl(2) as a bounded subalgebra into \gg as above. In two of these cases \sl(2) is a symmetric subalgebra, and many results about simple bounded (\gg,\sl(2))-modules are known. A case where our results are entirely new is the case of a principal \sl(2)-subalgebra in \sp(4).
