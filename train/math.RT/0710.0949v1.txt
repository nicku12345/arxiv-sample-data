V. I. Arnold [Russian Math. Surveys 26, no. 2, 1971, 29-43] constructed smooth generic families of matrices with respect to similarity transformations depending smoothly on the entries of matrices and got bifurcation diagrams of such families with a small number of parameters. We extend these results to pencils of matrices.
