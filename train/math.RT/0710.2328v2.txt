Let R be a finite dimensional k-algebra over an algebraically closed field k and \mathrm{mod} R be the category of all finitely generated left R-modules. For a given full subcategory \mathcal{X} of \mathrm{mod} R, we denote by \pfd \mathcal{X} the projective finitistic dimension of \mathcal{X}. That is, \pfd \mathcal{X}:=\mathrm{sup} \{\pd X : X\in\mathcal{X} \text{and} \pd X<\infty\}. \   It was conjectured by H. Bass in the 60's that the projective finitistic dimension \pfd (R):=\pfd (\mathrm{mod} R) has to be finite. Since then, much work has been done toward the proof of this conjecture. Recently, K. Igusa and J. Todorov defined a function \Psi:\mathrm{mod} R\to \Bbb{N}, which turned out to be useful to prove that \pfd (R) is finite for some classes of algebras. In order to have a different approach to the finitistic dimension conjecture, we propose to consider a class of full subcategories of \mathrm{mod} R instead of a class of algebras, namely to take the class of categories \F(\theta) of \theta-filtered R-modules for all stratifying systems (\theta,\leq) in \mathrm{mod} R.
