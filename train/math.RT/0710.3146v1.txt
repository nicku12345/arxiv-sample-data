We give a description of all the cuspidal representations of \mathrm{GL}_4(\mathfrak{o}_2), where \mathfrak{o}_2 is a finite ring coming from the ring of integers in a local field, modulo the square of its maximal ideal \mathfrak{p}. This shows in particular the existence of representations which are cuspidal, yet are not strongly cuspidal, that is, do not have orbit with irreducible characteristic polynomial mod \mathfrak{p}. It has been shown by Aubert, Onn, and Prasad that this phenomenon cannot occur for \mathrm{GL}_n, when n is prime.
