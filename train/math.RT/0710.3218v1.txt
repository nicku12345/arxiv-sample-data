We define a commuting family of operators T_0,T_1,...,T_n in the Temperley--Lieb algebra \mathcal{A}_n(x) of type A_{n-1}. Using an appropriate analogue to Murphy basis of the Iwahori--Hecke algebra of the symmetric group, we describe the eigenvalues arising from the triangular action of the said operators on the cell modules of \mathcal{A}_n(x). These results are used to provide the Temperley--Lieb algebras of type A_{n-1} with a semi--normal form, together with a branching law, and explicit formulae for associated Gram determinants.
