On restriction to the maximal compact subgroup \mathrm{GL}(3,\mathscr{R}), an unramified principal series representation of the p-adic group \mathrm{GL}(3,F) decomposes into a direct sum of finite-dimensional irreducibles each appearing with finite multiplicity. We describe a coarser decomposition into components which, although reducible in general, capture the equivalences between the irreducible constituents.
