We decompose the restriction of ramified principal series representations of the p-adic group \mathrm{GL}(3,\mathrm{k}) to its maximal compact subgroup K=\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathscr{R}). Its decomposition is dependent on the degree of ramification of the inducing characters and can be characterized in terms of filtrations of the Iwahori subgroup in K. We establish several irreducibility results and illustrate the decomposition with some examples.
