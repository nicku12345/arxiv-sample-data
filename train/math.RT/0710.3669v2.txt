We study the cyclic U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)-module generated by the l-th power of the \alpha-determinant. When l is a non-negative integer, for all but finite exceptional values of alpha, one shows that this cyclic module is isomorphic to the n-th tensor space (S^l(\mathbb{C}^n))^{\otimes n} of the symmetric l-th tensor space of \mathbb{C}^n. If alpha is exceptional, then the structure of the module changes drastically, i.e. some irreducible representations which are the irreducible components of the decomposition of (S^l(\mathbb{C}^n))^{\otimes n} disappear in the decomposition of the cyclic module. The degeneration of each isotypic component of the cyclic module is described by a matrix whose size is given by a Kostka number and entries are polynomials in alpha with rational coefficients. As a special case, we determine the matrix in a full of the detail for the case where n=2; the matrix becomes a scalar and is essentially given by the classical Jacobi polynomial. Moreover, we prove that these polynomials are unitary.
