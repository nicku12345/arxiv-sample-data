A way to construct (conjecturally all) simple finite dimensional modular Lie (super)algebras over algebraically closed fields of characteristic not 2 is offered. In characteristic 2, the method is supposed to give only simple Lie (super)algebras graded by integers and only some of the non-graded ones). The conjecture is backed up with the latest results computationally most difficult of which are obtained with the help of Grozman's software package SuperLie.
