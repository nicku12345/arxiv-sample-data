Let X=H/L be an irreducible real bounded symmetric domain realized as a real form in an Hermitian symmetric domain D=G/K. The intersection S of the   Shilov boundary of D with X defines a distinguished subset of the topological boundary of X and is invariant under H and can also be realized as S=H/P for certain parabolic subgroup P of H. We study the spherical representations Ind_P^H(\lam) of H induced from P. We find formulas for the spherical functions in terms of the Macdonald {}_2F_1 hypergeometric function. This generalizes the earlier result of Faraut-Koranyi for Hermitian symmetric spaces D. We consider a class of H-invariant integral intertwining operators from the representations Ind_P^H(\lam) on L^2(S) to the holomorphic representations of G on D restricted to H. We construct a new class of complementary series for the groups H=SO(n, m), SU(n, m) (with n-m >2) and Sp(n, m) (with n-m>1). We realize them as a discrete component in the branching rule of the analytic continuation of the holomorphic discrete series of G=SU(n, m), SU(n, m)\times SU(n, m) and SU(2n, 2m) respectively.
