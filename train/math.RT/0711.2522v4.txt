By Tits' deformation argument, a generic Iwahori--Hecke algebra H associated to a finite Coxeter group W is abstractly isomorphic to the group algebra of W. Lusztig has shown how one can construct an explicit isomorphism, provided that the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of H satisfies certain deep properties. If W is crystallographic and H is a one-parameter algebra, then these properties are known to hold thanks to a geometric interpretation. In this paper, we develop some new general methods for verifying these properties, and we do verify them for two-parameter algebras of type I_2(m) and F_4 (where no geometric interpretation is available in general). Combined with previous work by Alvis, Bonnaf\'e, DuCloux, Iancu and the author, we can then extend Lusztig's construction of an explicit isomorphism to all types of W, without any restriction on the parameters of H.
