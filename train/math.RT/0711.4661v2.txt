Buan, Marsh and Reiten proved that if a cluster-tilting object T in a cluster category \mathcal C associated to an acyclic quiver Q satisfies certain conditions with respect to the exchange pairs in \mathcal C, then the denominator in its reduced form of every cluster variable in the cluster algebra associated to Q has exponents given by the dimension vector of the corresponding module over the endomorphism algebra of T. In this paper, we give an alternative proof of this result using the Caldero-Keller approach to acyclic cluster algebras and the work of Palu on cluster characters.
