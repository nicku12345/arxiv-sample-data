In this paper, and a second part to follow, we complete the programme (initiated more than 15 years ago) of determining the decomposition numbers and verifying James' Conjecture for Iwahori--Hecke algebras of exceptional type. The new ingredients which allow us to achieve this aim are:   - the fact, recently proved by the first author, that all Hecke algebras of finite type are cellular in the sense of Graham--Lehrer, and   - the explicit determination of W-graphs for the irreducible (generic) representations of Hecke algebras of type E_7 and E_8 by Howlett and Yin.   Thus, we can reduce the problem of computing decomposition numbers to a manageable size where standard techniques, e.g., Parker's {\sf MeatAxe} and its variations, can be applied. In this part, we describe the theoretical foundations for this procedure.
