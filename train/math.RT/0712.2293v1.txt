We prove that the multiplicity of each irreducible component in the \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)-cyclic module generated by the l-th power \det^{(\alpha)}(X)^l of the \alpha-determinant is given by the rank of a matrix whose entries are given by a variation of the spherical Fourier transformation for (\mathfrak{S}_{nl},\mathfrak{S}_l^n). Further, we calculate the matrix explicitly when n=2. This gives not only another proof of the result by Kimoto-Matsumoto-Wakayama (2007) but also a new aspect of the representation theory of the \alpha-determinants.
