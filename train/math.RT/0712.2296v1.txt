The determination of scalars involved in Lusztig's conjecture for finite reductive groups G(F_q) was achieved by Waldspurger in the case of symplectic groups or orthogonal groups, under the condition that p,q are large enough. Here p is the characteristic of the finite field F_q. In this paper, we determine the scalars in the case of symplectic groups with p = 2, by applying the theory of symmetric spaces over a finite field due to Kawanaka and Lusztig. We also obtain a partial result in the case of special orthogonal groups with p = 2.
