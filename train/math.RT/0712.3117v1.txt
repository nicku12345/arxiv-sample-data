For every involution \mathbf{w} of the symmetric group S_n we establish, in terms ofa special canonical quotient of the dominant Verma module associated with \mathbf{w}, an effective criterion, which allows us to verify whether the universal enveloping algebra U(\mathfrak{sl}_n) surjects onto the space of all ad-finite linear transformations of the simple highest weight module L(\mathbf{w}). An easy sufficient condition derived from this criterion admits a straightforward computational check for example using a computer. All this is applied to get some old and many new results, which answer the classical question of Kostant in special cases, in particular we give a complete answer for simple highest weight modules in the regular block of \mathfrak{sl}_n, n\leq 5.
