We give a general parametrization of all the recollement data for a triangulated category with a set of generators. From this we deduce a characterization of when a perfectly generated (or aisled) triangulated category is a recollement of triangulated categories generated by a single compact object. Also, we use homological epimorphisms of dg categories to give a complete and explicit description of all the recollement data for (or smashing subcategories of) the derived category of a k-flat dg category. In the final part we give a bijection between smashing subcategories of compactly generated triangulated categories and certain ideals of the subcategory of compact objects, in the spirit of Henning Krause's work. This bijection implies the following weak version of the Generalized Smashing Conjecture: in a compactly generated triangulated category every smashing subcategory is generated by a set of Milnor colimits of compact objects.
