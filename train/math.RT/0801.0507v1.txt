We study torsion torsionfree(=TTF) triples in abelian and triangulated categories. (Notice that TTF triples in a triangulated category are essentially in bijection with recollement data for this triangulated category.) In particular, we complete Jans' characterization of split TTF triples on a category of modules, prove a weak version of the Generalized Smashing Conjecture, use homological epimorphisms of differential graded(=dg) categories to give an explicite description of all the TTF triples in the derived category of a k-flat dg category and develope an unbounded approach to Koenig's theorem on recollements of right bounded derived categories of ordinary algebras.
