We construct a Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand type resolution in terms of direct sums of Kac modules for the finite-dimensional irreducible tensor representations of the general linear superalgebra. As a consequence it follows that the unique maximal submodule of a corresponding reducible Kac module is generated by its proper singular vector.
