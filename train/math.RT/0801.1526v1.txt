In this paper, we look at the problem of determining the composition factors for the affine graded Hecke algebra via the computation of Kazhdan-Lusztig type polynomials. We review the algorithms of \cite{L1,L2}, and use them in particular to compute, at every real central character which admits tempered modules, the geometric parameterization, the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, the composition series, and the Iwahori-Matsumoto involution for the representations with Iwahori fixed vectors of the split p-adic groups of type G_2 and F_4.
