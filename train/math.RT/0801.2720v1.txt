Recall that an algebraic module is a KG-module that satisfies a polynomial with integer coefficients, with addition and multiplication given by direct sum and tensor product. In this article we prove that non-periodic algebraic modules are very rare, and that if the complexity of an algebraic module is at least 3, then it is the only algebraic module on its component of the (stable) Auslander--Reiten quiver. We include a strong conjecture on the relationship between periodicity and algebraicity.
