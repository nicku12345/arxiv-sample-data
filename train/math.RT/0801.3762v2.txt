The purpose of this paper is to give an explicit formula for the number of non-isomorphic cluster-tilted algebras of type A_n, by counting the mutation class of any quiver with underlying graph A_n. It will also follow that if T and T' are cluster-tilting objects in a cluster category \mathcal{C}, then \End_{\mathcal{C}}(T) is isomorphic to \End_{\mathcal{C}}(T') if and only if T=\tau^i T'.
