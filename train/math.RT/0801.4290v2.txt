After establishing a geometric Schur-Weyl duality in a general setting, we recall this duality in type A in the finite and affine case. We extend the duality in the affine case to positive parts of the affine algebras. The positive parts have nice ideals coming from geometry, allowing duality for quotients. Some of the quotients of the positive affine Hecke algebra are then identified to some cyclotomic Hecke algebras and the geometric setting allows the construction of canonical bases.
