If Q is a non degenerate quadratic form on {\bb C}^n, it is well known that the differential operators X=Q(x), Y=Q(\partial), and H=E+\frac{n}{2}, where E is the Euler operator, generate a Lie algebra isomorphic to {\go sl}_{2}. Therefore the associative algebra they generate is a quotient of the universal enveloping algebra {\cal U}({\go sl}_{2}). This fact is in some sense the foundation of the metaplectic representation. The present paper is devoted to the study of the case where Q(x) is replaced by \Delta_{0}(x), where \Delta_{0}(x) is the relative invariant of a prehomogeneous vector space of commutative parabolic type ( {\go g},V ), or equivalently where \Delta_{0} is the "determinant" function of a simple Jordan algebra V over {\bb C}. In this Part I we show several structure results for the associative algebra generated by X=\Delta_{0}(x), Y=\Delta_{0}(\partial). Our main result shows that if we consider this algebra as an algebra over a certain commutative ring {\bf A} of invariant differential operators it is isomorphic to the quotient of what we call a generalized Smith algebra S(f, {\bf A}, n) where f\in {\bf A}[t]. The Smith algebras (over {\bb C}) were introduced by P. Smith as "natural" generalizations of {\cal U}({\go sl}_{2}).
