In this paper we consider the restriction of a unitary irreducible representation of type A_{\mathfrak q}(\lambda) of GL(4,{\mathbb R}) to reductive subgroups H which are the fixpoint sets of an involution. We obtain a formula for the restriction to the symplectic group and to GL(2,{\mathbb C}), and as an application we construct in the last section some representations in the cuspidal spectrum of the symplectic and the complex general linear group. In addition to working directly with the cohmologically induced module to obtain the branching law, we also introduce the useful concept of pseudo dual pairs of subgroups in a reductive Lie group.
