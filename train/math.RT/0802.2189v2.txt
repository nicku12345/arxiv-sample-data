We show that for an artin algebra \Lambda, the telescope conjecture for module categories is equivalent to certain idempotent ideals of mod-\Lambda being generated by identity morphisms. As a consequence, we prove the conjecture for domestic standard selfinjective algebras and domestic special biserial algebras. We achieve this by showing that in any Krull-Schmidt category with local d.c.c. on ideals, any idempotent ideal is generated by identity maps and maps from the transfinite radical.
