Let g be a classical Lie algebra, i.e., either gl_n, sp_n, or so_n and let e\in g be a nilpotent element. We study various properties of centralisers g_e. The first four sections deal with rather elementary questions, like the centre of g_e, commuting varieties associated with g_e, or centralisers of commuting pairs. The second half of the paper addresses problems related to different Poisson structures on g_e^* and symmetric invariants of g_e.
