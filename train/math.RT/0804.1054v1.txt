We study the problem of lifting and restricting TTF triples (equivalently, recollement data) for a certain wide type of triangulated categories. This, together with the parametrizations of TTF triples given in "Parametrizing recollement data", allows us to show that many well-known recollements of right bounded derived categories of algebras are restrictions of recollements in the unbounded level, and leads to criteria to detect recollements of general right bounded derived categories. In particular, we give in Theorem 1 necessary and sufficient conditions for a 'right bounded' derived category of a differential graded(=dg) category to be a recollement of 'right bounded' derived categories of dg categories. In Theorem 2 we consider the particular case in which those dg categories are just ordinary algebras.
