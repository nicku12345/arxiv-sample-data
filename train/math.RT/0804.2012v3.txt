The definition of Rouquier for the families of characters of Weyl groups in terms of blocks of the associated Iwahori-Hecke algebra has made possible the generalization of this notion to the complex reflection groups. Here we give an algorithm for the determination of the "Rouquier blocks" of the cyclotomic Ariki-Koike algebras.
