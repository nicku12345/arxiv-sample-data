We introduce a notion of continuous crystal analogous, for general Coxeter groups, to the combinatorial crystals introduced by Kashiwara in representation theory of Lie algebras. We use a generalization of the Littelmann path model to show the existence of the crystals, and study an associated Duistermaat-Heckman measure, which we interpret in terms of Brownian motion. We also show that the Littelmann path operators can be derived from simple considerations on Sturm-Liouville equations.
