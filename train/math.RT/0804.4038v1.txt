Let (G,K) be one of the following classical irreducible Hermitian symmetric pairs of noncompact type: (SU(p,q), S(U(p) \times U(q))),(Sp(n,R), U(n)), or (SO*(2n), U(n)). Let G_{\mathbb C} and K_{\mathbb C} be complexifications of G and K, respectively, and let P be a maximal parabolic subgroup of G_{\mathbb C} whose Levi subgroup is K_{\mathbb C}. Let V be the holomorphic part of the complexifiaction of the tangent space at the origin of G/K. It is well known that the ring of K_{\mathbb C}-invariant differential operators on V has a generating system \{\varGamma_k \} given in terms of determinant or Pfaffian that plays an essential role in the Capelli identities. Our main result of this paper is that determinant or Pfaffian of the ``moment map'' on the holomorphic cotangent bundle of G_{\mathbb C}/P provides a generating function for the principal symbols of \varGamma_k's.
