The "Rouquier blocks" of the cyclotomic Hecke algebras, introduced by Rouquier, are a substitute for the "families of characters", defined by Lusztig for Weyl groups, which can be applied to all complex reflection groups. In this article, we determine them for the cyclotomic Hecke algebras of the groups of the infinite series, G(de,e,r), thus completing their calculation for all complex reflection groups.
