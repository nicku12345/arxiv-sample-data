Let k be a field and A a finite-dimensional k-algebra of global dimension \leq 2. We construct a triangulated category \Cc_A associated to A which, if A is hereditary, is triangle equivalent to the cluster category of A. When \Cc_A is \Hom-finite, we prove that it is 2-CY and endowed with a canonical cluster-tilting object. This new class of categories contains some of the stable categories of modules over a preprojective algebra studied by Geiss-Leclerc-Schr{\"o}er and by Buan-Iyama-Reiten-Scott. Our results also apply to quivers with potential. Namely, we introduce a cluster category \Cc_{(Q,W)} associated to a quiver with potential (Q,W). When it is Jacobi-finite we prove that it is endowed with a cluster-tilting object whose endomorphism algebra is isomorphic to the Jacobian algebra \Jj(Q,W).
