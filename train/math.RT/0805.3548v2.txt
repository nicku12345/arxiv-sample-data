We associate to each nilpotent orbit of a real semisimple Lie algebra g_o a weighted Vogan diagram, that is a Dynkin diagram with an involution of the diagram, a subset of painted nodes and a weight for each node. Every nilpotent element of g_o is noticed in some subalgebra of g_o. In this paper we characterize the weighted Vogan diagrams associated to orbits of noticed nilpotent elements.
