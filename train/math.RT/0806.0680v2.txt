Let W be a Weyl group, and let \CT_W be the complex toric variety attached to the fan of cones corresponding to the reflecting hyperplanes of W, and its weight lattice. The real locus \CT_W(\R) is a smooth, connected, compact manifold with a W-action. We give a formula for the equivariant Euler characteristic of \CT_W(\R) as a generalised character of W. In type A_{n-1} for n odd, one obtains a generalised character of \Sym_n whose degree is (up to sign) the n^{\text{th}} Euler number.
