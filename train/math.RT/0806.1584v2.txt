In the following article, we give a description of the distingushed irreducible principal series representations of the general linear group over a p-adic field in terms of inducing datum. This provides a counter-example to a conjecture of Jacquet about distinction (Conjecture 1 in U.K Anandavardhanan, "Distinguished non-Archimedean representations ", Proc. Hyderabad Conference on Algebra and Number Theory, 2005, 183-192).
