We prove an explicit formula for a projection of singular vectors in the Verma module over a rank 2 Kac-Moody Lie algebra onto the universal enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg Lie algebra and of sl_{2} (Theorem 3). The formula is derived from a more general but less explicit formula due to Feigin, Fuchs and Malikov [Funct. Anal. Appl. 20 (1986), no. 2, 103-113]. In the simpler case of A_{1}^{1} the formula was obtained in [Fuchs D., Funct. Anal. Appl. 23 (1989), no. 2, 154-156].
