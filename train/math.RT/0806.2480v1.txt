Using Howe duality we compute explicitly Kostant-type homology groups for a wide class of representations of the infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebra \hat{\frak{gl}}_{\infty|\infty} and its classical subalgebras at positive integral levels. We also obtain Kostant-type homology formulas for the Lie algebra  widehat{\frak{gl}}_\infty at negative integral levels. We further construct resolutions in terms of generalized Verma modules for these representations.
