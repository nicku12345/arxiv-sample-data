We prove an explicit condition on the level k for the irreducibility of a vacuum module V^{k} over a (non-twisted) affine Lie superalgebra, which was conjectured by M. Gorelik and V.G. Kac. An immediate consequence of this work is the simplicity conditions for the corresponding minimal W-algebras obtained via quantum reduction, in all cases except when the level k is a non-negative integer.
