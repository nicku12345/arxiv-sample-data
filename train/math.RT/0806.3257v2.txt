Bloch and Okounkov's correlation function on the infinite wedge space has connections to Gromov-Witten theory, Hilbert schemes, symmetric groups, and certain character functions of \hgl_\infty-modules of level one. Recent works have calculated these character functions for higher levels for \hgl_\infty and its Lie subalgebras of classical type. Here we obtain these functions for the subalgebra of type D of half-integral levels and as a byproduct, obtain q-dimension formulas for integral modules of type D at half-integral level.
