W-algebras of finite type are certain finitely generated associative algebras closely related to the universal enveloping algebras of semisimple Lie algebras. In this paper we prove a conjecture of Premet that gives an almost complete classification of finite dimensional irreducible modules for W-algebras. Also we study a relation between Harish-Chandra bimodules and bimodules over W-algebras.
