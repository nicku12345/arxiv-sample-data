The families of characters, defined by Lusztig for Weyl groups, play an important role in the representation theory of finite reductive groups. The definition of Rouquier for the families of characters in terms of blocks of the Hecke algebra has made possible the generalization of this notion to the case of complex reflection groups. In this article, we study the Rouquier blocks of the cyclotomic Hecke algebras and we show that they depend on numerical data determined by the generic Hecke algebra. Moreover, we provide the algorithm and the results of their determination for all exceptional complex reflection groups.
