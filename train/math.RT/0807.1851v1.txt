In this paper we classify a linear family of Lie brackets on the space of rectangular matrices Mat(n\times m,\K) and we give an analogue of the Ado's Theorem. We give also a similar classification on the algebra of the square matrices Mat(n, \K) and as a consequence, we prove that we can't built a faithful representation of the (2n+1)-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra \mathfrak{H}_n in a vector space V with \dim V\leq n+1. Finally, we prove that in the case of the algebra of square matrices Mat(n,\K), the corresponding Lie algebras structures are a contraction of the canonical Lie algebra \mathfrak{gl}(n,\K).
