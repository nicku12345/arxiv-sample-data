This is an introduction to the Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations software, for computing representation and structure theory of real reductive groups. The user is led through the basic commands of the software, via numerous examples. See Algorithms for Representation Theory of Real Reductive Groups, arXiv number 0807.3093, for a more complete mathematical description of the algorithm
