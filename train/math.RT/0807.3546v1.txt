The McKay Conjecture (MC) asserts the existence of a bijection between the (inequivalent) complex irreducible representations of degree coprime to p (p a prime) of a finite group G and those of the subgroup N, the normalizer of Sylow p-subgroup. In this paper we observe that MC implies the existence of analogous bijections involving various pairs of algebras, including certain crossed products, and that MC is \emph{equivalent} to the analogous statement for (twisted) quantum doubles. Using standard conjectures in orbifold conformal field theory, MC is \emph{equivalent} to parallel statements about holomorphic orbifolds V^G, V^N. There is a uniform formulation of MC covering these different situations which involves quantum dimensions of objects in pairs of ribbon fusion categories.
