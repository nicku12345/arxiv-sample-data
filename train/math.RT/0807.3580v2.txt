A subspace of the space, L(n), of traceless complex n\times n matrices can be specified by requiring that the entries at some positions (i,j) be zero. The set, I, of these positions is a (zero) pattern and the corresponding subspace of L(n) is denoted by L_I(n). A pattern I is universal if every matrix in L(n) is unitarily similar to some matrix in L_I(n). The problem of describing the universal patterns is raised, solved in full for n\le3, and partial results obtained for n=4. Two infinite families of universal patterns are constructed. They give two analogues of Schur's triangularization theorem.
