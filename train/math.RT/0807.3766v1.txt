This note is concerned with the unipotent characters of the Ree groups of type G_2. We determine the roots of unity associated by Lusztig and Digne-Michel to unipotent characters of ^2G_2(3^{2n+1}) and we prove that the Fourier matrix of ^2G_2(3^{2n+1}) defined by Geck and Malle satisfies a conjecture of Digne-Michel. Our main tool is the Shintani descent of Ree groups of type G_2.
