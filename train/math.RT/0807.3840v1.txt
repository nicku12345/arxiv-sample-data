We use the maximal faces of the m-cluster complex of type A to describe the m-cluster tilted algebras of type A as quivers with relations. We then classify connected components of m-cluster tilted algebras of type A up to derived equivalence using tilting complexes directly related to the combinatorics of the m-cluster complex of type A. This generalizes a result of Buan and Vatne.
