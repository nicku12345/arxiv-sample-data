We study ad-nilpotent ideals of a parabolic subalgebra of a simple Lie algebra. Any such ideal determines an antichain in a set of positive roots of the simple Lie algebra. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for an antichain to determine an ad-nilpotent ideal of the parabolic. We write down all such antichains for the classical simple Lie algebras and in particular recover the results of D. Peterson. In section 2 of the paper we study the unique ideal in a parabolic which is irreducible as a module for the reductive part and give several equivalent statements that are satisfied by the corresponding subset of roots.
