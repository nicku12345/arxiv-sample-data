We exhibit cocycles representing certain classes in the rational cohomology of of the general linear group with coefficients in the divided powers of a Frobenius twist of the adjoint representation. These classes' existence was anticipated by van der Kallen, and they intervene in the proof that reductive linear algebraic groups have finitely generated cohomology algebras.
