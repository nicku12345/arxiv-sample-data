One aspect of the Langlands program for linear groups is lifting of characters, which relates virtual representations on a group G with those on an endoscopic group for G. The goal of this paper is to extend this theory to nonlinear two-fold covers of real groups in the simply laced case. Suppose \tG is a two-fold cover of a real reductive group G. The main result is that there is an operation, denoted \Lift_G^{\tG}, taking a stable virtual character of G to 0 or a virtual genuine character of \tG, and \Lift_G^{\tG}(\Theta_\pi) may be explicitly computed if \pi is a stable sum of standard modules.
