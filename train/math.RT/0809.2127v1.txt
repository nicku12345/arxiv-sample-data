We give a characterization of a generalized Whittaker model of a degenerate principal series representation of GL(n,\R) as the kernel of some differential operators. By this characterization, we investigate some examples on GL(4,\R). We obtain the dimensions of the generalized Whittaker models and give their basis in terms of hypergeometric functions of one and two variables. We show the multiplicity one of the generalized Whittaker models by using the theory of hypergeometric functions.
