Let G be a simple simply connected algebraic group scheme defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0. Let T be a maximal split torus in G, B \supset T be a Borel subgroup of G and U its unipotent radical. Let F: G \rightarrow G be the Frobenius morphism. For r \geq 1 define the Frobenius kernel, G_r, to be the kernel of F iterated with itself r times. Define U_r (respectively B_r) to be the kernel of the Frobenius map restricted to U (respectively B). Let X(T) be the integral weight lattice and X(T)_+ be the dominant integral weights.   The computations of particular importance are \h^2(U_1,k), \h^2(B_r,\la) for \la \in X(T), \h^2(G_r,H^0(\la)) for \la \in X(T)_+, and \h^2(B,\la) for \la \in X(T). The above cohomology groups for the case when the field has characteristic 2 one computed in this paper. These computations complete the picture started by Bendel, Nakano, and Pillen for p \geq 3 \cite{BNP2}.
