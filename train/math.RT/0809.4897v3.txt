The concept of cluster tilting gives a higher analogue of classical Auslander correspondence between representation-finite algebras and Auslander algebras. The n-Auslander-Reiten translation functor \tau_n plays an important role in the study of n-cluster tilting subcategories. We study the category \MM_n of preinjective-like modules obtained by applying \tau_n to injective modules repeatedly. We call a finite dimensional algebra \Lambda \emph{n-complete} if \MM_n=\add M for an n-cluster tilting object M. Our main result asserts that the endomorphism algebra \End_\Lambda(M) is (n+1)-complete. This gives an inductive construction of n-complete algebras. For example, any representation-finite hereditary algebra \Lambda^{(1)} is 1-complete. Hence the Auslander algebra \Lambda^{(2)} of \Lambda^{(1)} is 2-complete. Moreover, for any n\ge1, we have an n-complete algebra \Lambda^{(n)} which has an n-cluster tilting object M^{(n)} such that \Lambda^{(n+1)}=\End_{\Lambda^{(n)}}(M^{(n)}). We give the presentation of \Lambda^{(n)} by a quiver with relations. We apply our results to construct n-cluster tilting subcategories of derived categories of n-complete algebras.
