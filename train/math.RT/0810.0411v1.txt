Let D be a triangulated category with a cluster tilting subcategory U. The quotient category D/U is abelian; suppose that it has finite global dimension.   We show that projection from D to D/U sends cluster tilting subcategories of D to support tilting subcategories of D/U, and that, in turn, support tilting subcategories of D/U can be lifted uniquely to maximal 1-orthogonal subcategories of D.
