We consider the dual space of linear groups over Dynkinian and Euclidean algebras, i.e. finite dimensional algebras derived equivalent to the path algebra of Dynkin or Euclidean quiver. We prove that this space contains an open dense subset isomorphic to the product of dual spaces of full linear groups and, perhaps, one more (explicitly described) space. The proof uses the technique of bimodule categories, deformations and representations of quivers.
