Let \Gamma be a quiver on n vertices v_1, v_2, ..., v_n with g_{ij} edges between v_i and v_j, and let \alpha \in \N^n. Hua gave a formula for A_{\Gamma}(\alpha, q), the number of isomorphism classes of absolutely indecomposable representations of \Gamma over the finite field \F_q with dimension vector \alpha. Kac showed that A_{\Gamma}(\bm{\alpha}, q) is a polynomial in q with integer coefficients. Using Hua's formula, we show that for each non-negative integer s, the s-th derivative of A_{\Gamma}(\alpha,q) with respect to q, when evaluated at q = 1, is a polynomial in the variables g_{ij}, and we compute the highest degree terms in this polynomial. Our formulas for these coefficients depend on the enumeration of certain families of connected graphs.
