A contragredient Lie superalgebra is a superalgebra defined by a Cartan matrix. A contragredient Lie superalgebra has finite-growth if the dimensions of the graded components (in the natural grading) depend polynomially on the degree. In this paper we classify finite-growth contragredient Lie superalgebras. Previously, such a classification was known only for the symmetrizable case.
