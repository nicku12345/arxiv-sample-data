We define regular Kac-Moody superalgebras and classify them using integrable modules. We give conditions for irreducible highest weight modules of regular Kac-Moody superalgebras to be integrable. This paper is a major part of the proof for the classification of finite-growth contragredient Lie superalgebras.
