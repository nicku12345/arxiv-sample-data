In the last section of the paper "Generalized induction of Kazhdan-Lusztig cells" and in "Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in affine Weyl groups of rank 2" the author described the partition into Kazhdan-Lusztig cells of the affine Weyl groups of rank 2 for all choices of parameters. The proof of these results relies on some explicit computations with GAP. In these notes we give some details of these computations.
