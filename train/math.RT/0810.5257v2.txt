Let G_{n,r}(\bbK) be the Grassmannian manifold of k-dimensional \bbK-subspaces in \bbK^n where \bbK=\mathbb R, \mathbb C, \mathbb H is the field of real, complex or quaternionic numbers. We consider the Radon, cosine and sine transforms, \mathcal R_{r^\prime, r}, \mathcal C_{r^\prime, r} and \mathcal S_{r^\prime, r}, from the L^2 space L^2(G_{n,r}(\bbK)) to the space L^2(G_{n,r^\prime}(\bbK)), for r, r^\prime \le n-1. The L^2 spaces are decomposed into irreducible representations of G with multiplicity free. We compute the spectral symbols of the transforms under the decomposition. For that purpose we prove two Bernstein-Sato type formulas on general root systems of type BC for the sine and cosine type functions on the compact torus \mathbb R^r/{2\pi Q^\vee} generalizing our recent results for the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions on the non-compact space \mathbb R^r. We find then also a characterization of the images of the transforms. Our results generalize those of Alesker-Bernstein and Grinberg. We prove further that the Knapp-Stein intertwining operator for certain induced representations is given by the sine transform and we give the unitary structure of the Stein's complementary series in the compact picture.
