We give an apriori description of a set of irreducible representations of a Weyl group which parametrize the nilpotent orbits in the Lie algebra of a connected reductive group in arbitrary characteristic. We also answer a question of Serre concerning the conjugacy class of a power of a unipotent element in a connected reductive group.
