Let K/F be a quadratic extension of p-adic fields. The Bernstein-Zelevinsky's classification asserts that generic representations are parabolically induced from quasi-square-integrable representations. We show, following a method developed by Cogdell and Piatetski-Shapiro, that the equality of the Rankin-Selberg type Asai L-function of generic representations of GL(n,K) and of the Asai L-function of the Langlands parameter, is equivalent to the truth of a conjecture about classification of distinguished generic representations in terms of the inducing quasi-square-integrable representations. As the conjecture is true for principal series representations, this gives the expression of the Asai L-function of such representations.
