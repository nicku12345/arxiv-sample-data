Let X be a smooth real algebraic variety. Let \xi be a distribution on it. One can define the singular support of \xi to be the singular support of the D_X-module generated by \xi (some times it is also called the characteristic variety). A powerful property of the singular support is that it is a coisotropic subvariety of T^*X. This is the integrability theorem (see [KKS, Mal, Gab]). This theorem turned out to be useful in representation theory of real reductive groups (see e.g. [AG_AMOT, AS, Say]).   The aim of this paper is to give an analog of this theorem to the non-Archimedean case. The theory of D-modules is not available to us so we need a different definition of the singular support. We use the notion wave front set from [Hef] and define the singular support to be its Zariski closure. Then we prove that the singular support satisfies some property that we call weakly coisotropic, which is weaker than being coisotropic but is enough for some applications. We also prove some other properties of the singular support that were trivial in the Archimedean case (using the algebraic definition) but not obvious in the non-Archimedean case.
