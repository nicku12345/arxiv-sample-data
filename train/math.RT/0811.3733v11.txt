Let K/F be a quadratic extension of p-adic fields, \sigma the nontrivial element of the Galois group of K over F, and \pi a quasi-square-integrable representation of GL(n,K). Denoting by \pi^{\vee} the smooth contragredient of \pi, and by \pi^{\sigma} the representation \pi\circ \sigma, we show that the representation of GL(2n, K) obtained by normalized parabolic induction of the representation \pi^\vee \otimes \pi^\sigma is distinguished with respect to GL(2n,F). This is a step towards the classification of distinguished generic representations of general linear groups over p-adic fields.
