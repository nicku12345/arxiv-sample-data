We prove that the natural map from the center of the affine Sergeev superalgebra to the even center of any cyclotomic Sergeev superalgebra of odd level is surjective, hence that the even center of a cyclotomic Sergeev superalgebra of odd level consists of symmetric functions in the squares of its polynomial generators.
