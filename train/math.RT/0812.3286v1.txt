We show how any finite-dimensional algebra can be realized as an idempotent subquotient of some symmetric quasi-hereditary algebra. In the special case of rigid symmetric algebras we show that they can be realized as centralizer subalgebras of symmetric quasi-hereditary algebras. We also show that the infinite-dimensional symmetric quasi-hereditary algebras we construct admit quasi-hereditary structure with respect to two opposite orders, that they have strong exact Borel and \Delta-subalgebras and the corresponding triangular decompositions.
