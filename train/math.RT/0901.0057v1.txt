We explain how to deduce the degenerate analogue of Ariki's categorification theorem over the ground field C as an application of Schur-Weyl duality for higher levels and the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture in finite type A. We also discuss some supplementary topics, including Young modules, tensoring with sign, tilting modules and Ringel duality.
