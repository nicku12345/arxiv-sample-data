Let G be a compact subgroup of GL_n(\R) acting linearly on a finite dimensional vector space E. B. Malgrange has shown that the space \mathcal{C}^\infty(\R^n,E)^G of \mathcal{C}^\infty and G-covariant functions is a finite module over the ring \mathcal{C}^\infty(\R^n)^G of \mathcal{C}^\infty and G-invariant functions. First, we generalize this result for the Schwartz space \mathscr{S}(\R^n,E)^G of G-covariant functions. Secondly, we prove that any G-covariant distribution can be decomposed into a sum of G-invariant distributions multiplied with a fixed family of G-covariant polynomials. This gives a generalization of an Oksak result proved in ([O]).
