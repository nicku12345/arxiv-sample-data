Let K/F be a quadratic extension of p-adic fields, and n a positive integer. A smooth irreducible representation of the group GL(n,K) is said to be distinguished, if it admits on its space a nonzero GL(n,F)-invariant linear form. In the present work, we classify genric distinguished representations of the group GL(n,K) in terms of inducing quasi-square-integrable representations. This has as a consequence the truth of the expected equality between the Rankin-Selberg type Asai L-function of a generic representation, and the Asai L-function of its Langlands parameter.
