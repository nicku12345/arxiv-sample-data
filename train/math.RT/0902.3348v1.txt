Let B be a representation-finite \mathbb{C}-algebra.   The \mathbb{Z}-Lie algebra L(B) associated with B has been defined by Ch. Riedtmann.   If B is representation-directed there is another \mathbb{Z}-Lie algebra associated with B defined by C. M. Ringel and denoted by \CK(B). We prove that the Lie algebras L(B) and \CK(B) are isomorphic for any representation-directed \mathbb{C}-algebra B.
