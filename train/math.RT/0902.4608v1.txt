The quantum \alpha-determinant is defined as a parametric deformation of the quantum determinant. We investigate the cyclic \mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)-submodules of the quantum matrix algebra \mathcal{A}_q(\mathrm{Mat}_2) generated by the powers of the quantum \alpha-determinant. For such a cyclic module, there exists a collection of polynomials which describe the irreducible decomposition of it in the following manner: (i) each polynomial corresponds to a certain irreducible \mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)-module, (ii) the cyclic module contains an irreducible submodule if the parameter is a root of the corresponding polynomial. These polynomials are given as a q-deformation of the hypergeometric polynomials. This is a quantum analogue of the result obtained in our previous work [K. Kimoto, S. Matsumoto and M. Wakayama, Alpha-determinant cyclic modules and Jacobi polynomials, to appear in Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.].
