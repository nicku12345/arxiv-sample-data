Let g be a simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. The goal of this note is to prove a closed formula for the Dynkin index of a principal sl_2-subalgebra of g. The key step in the proof uses the "strange formula" of Freudenthal--de Vries. As an application, we (1) compute the Dynkin index any simple g-module regarded as sl_2-module and (2) obtain an identity connecting the exponents of g and the dual Coxeter numbers of both g and the Langlands dual g^\vee.
