We concern the VIGRE's conjecture; namely the complexity of a Specht module is the p-weight of the corresponding partition if and only if the partition is not p by p. In abelian defect case, we calculate the cohomological variety of the Specht modules. In particular, we show that the Specht modules have complexities exactly given by the p-weights of the corresponding partitions. For some p-regular partitions not more than p parts with empty p-core, we show that the Specht modules fit into the conjecture. For the partition p^p, we show that the Specht module has complexity p-1 and we study the rank variety of the Specht module restricted to a maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup of rank p.
