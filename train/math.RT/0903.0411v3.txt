Let w be the p-weight of a hook partition \mu and E be an elementary abelian p-subgroup generated by w disjoint p-cycles. We compute the generic Jordan type of the Specht module corresponding to the partition \mu restricted to E. In particular, we show that the complexity of the Specht module is precisely the p-weight of the partition \mu.
