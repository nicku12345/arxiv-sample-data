Let G be one of the classical Lie groups \GL_{n+1}(\R), \GL_{n+1}(\C), \oU(p,q+1), \oO(p,q+1), \oO_{n+1}(\C), \SO(p,q+1), \SO_{n+1}(\C), and let G' be respectively the subgroup \GL_{n}(\R), \GL_{n}(\C), \oU(p,q), \oO(p,q), \oO_n(\C), \SO(p,q), \SO_n(\C), embedded in G in the standard way. We show that every irreducible Casselman-Wallach representation of G' occurs with multiplicity at most one in every irreducible Casselman-Wallach representation of G. Similar results are proved for the Jacobi groups \GL_{n}(\R)\ltimes \oH_{2n+1}(\R), \GL_{n}(\C)\ltimes \oH_{2n+1}(\C), \oU(p,q)\ltimes \oH_{2p+2q+1}(\R), \Sp_{2n}(\R)\ltimes \oH_{2n+1}(\R), \Sp_{2n}(\C)\ltimes \oH_{2n+1}(\C), with their respective subgroups \GL_{n}(\R), \GL_{n}(\C), \oU(p,q), \Sp_{2n}(\R), \Sp_{2n}(\C).
