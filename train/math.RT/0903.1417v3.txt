For every genuine irreducible admissible smooth representation \pi of the metaplectic group \widetilde{\Sp}(2n) over a p-adic field, and every smooth oscillator representation \omega_\psi of \widetilde{\Sp}(2n), we prove that the tensor product \pi\otimes \omega_\psi is multiplicity free as a smooth representation of the symplectic group \Sp(2n). Similar results are proved for general linear groups and unitary groups.
