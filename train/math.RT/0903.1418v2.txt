Let G be a classical group \GL(n), \oU(n), \oO(n) or \Sp(2n), over a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero. Let \pi be an irreducible admissible smooth representation of G. It is well known that the contragredient of \pi is isomorphic to a twist of \pi by an automorphism of G. We prove a similar result for double covers of G which occur in the study of local theta correspondences.
