We deduce using the Ringel-Hall algebra approach explicit formulas for the cardinalities of some Grassmannians over a finite field associated to the Kronecker quiver. We realize in this way a quantification of the formulas obtained by Caldero and Zelevinsky for the Euler characteristics of these Grassmannians. We also present a recursive algorithm for computing the cardinality of every Kronecker quiver Grassmannian over a finite field.
