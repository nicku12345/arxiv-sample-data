Let \mathcal{C} be a Hom-finite triangulated 2-Calabi-Yau category with a cluster tilting object. Under some constructibility assumptions on \mathcal{C} which are satisfied for instance by cluster categories, by generalized cluster categories and by stable categories of modules over a preprojective algebra, we prove a multiplication formula for the cluster character associated with any cluster tilting object. This formula generalizes those obtained by Caldero-Keller for representation finite path algebras and by Xiao-Xu for finite-dimensional path algebras. It is analogous to a formula obtained by Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer in the context of preprojective algebras.
