Let F be a non-archimedean local field, of characteristic 0. Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over F and q be a non-degenerate quadratic form on V. Denote G the special orthogonal group of (V,q). Let W a non-degenerate hyperplane of V, denote H the special orthogonal group of W. Let \pi, resp. \sigma, an admissible irreducible representation of G(F), resp. H(F). Denote m(\sigma,\pi) the dimension of the complex space Hom_{H(F)}(\pi_{| H(F)},\sigma). It's know that m(\sigma,\pi)=0 or 1. In a first paper, we have defined another term m_{geom}(\sigma,\pi). It's an explicit sum of integrals of functions that can be deduced from the characters of \sigma and \pi. Assume that \pi and \sigma are tempered. Then we prove the equality m(\sigma,\pi)=m_{geom}(\sigma,\pi). This generalize the result of the first paper, where \pi was supercuspidal. As in this paper, the previous equality implies as corollary (assuming certain properties of tempered L-packets) a weak form of the local Gross-Prasad conjecture, now for pairs of tempered L-packets.
