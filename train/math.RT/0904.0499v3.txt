We construct the finite dimensional simple integral modules for the (degenerate) affine Hecke-Clifford algebra (AHCA). Our construction includes an analogue of Zelevinsky's segment representations, a complete combinatorial description of the simple calibrated modules, and a classification of the simple integral modules. Additionally, we construct an analogue of the Arakawa-Suzuki functor for the Lie superalgebra of type Q.
