Let F be either R or C. Let (\pi,V) be an irreducible admissible smooth \Fre representation of GL(2n,F). A Shalika functional \phi:V \to \C is a continuous linear functional such that for any g\in GL_n(F), A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F) and v\in V we have  \phi[\pi g & A 0 & g)v] = \exp(2\pi i \re(\tr (g^{-1}A))) \phi(v). In this paper we prove that the space of Shalika functionals on V is at most one dimensional. For non-Archimedean F (of characteristic zero) this theorem was proven in [JR].
