Let \Phi be a classical root system and k be a field of sufficiently large characteristic. Let G be the classical group over k with the root system \Phi, U be its maximal unipotent subgroup and \mathfrak{u} be the Lie algebra of U. Let D be an orthogonal subset of \Phi and \Omega be a coadjoint orbit of U associated with D. We construct a polarization of \mathfrak{u} at the canonical form on \Omega. We also find the dimension of \Omega in terms of the Weyl group of \Phi. As a corollary, we determine all possible dimensions of irreducible complex represenations of the group U for the case of finite field k.
