We present a categorification of four mutation finite cluster algebras by the cluster category of the category of coherent sheaves over a weighted projective line of tubular weight type. Each of these cluster algebras which we call tubular is associated to an elliptic root system. We show that via a cluster character the cluster variables are in bijection with the positive real Schur roots associated to the weighted projective line. In one of the four cases this is achieved by the approach to cluster algebras of Fomin-Shapiro-Thurston using a 2-sphere with 4 marked points whereas in the remaining cases it is done by the approach of Geiss-Leclerc-Schroer using preprojective algebras.
