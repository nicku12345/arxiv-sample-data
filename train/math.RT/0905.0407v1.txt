We review Koszul duality in representation theory of category  \cal O , especially we give a new presentation of the Koszul duality functor. Combining this with work of Backelin, we show that the translation and Zuckerman functors are Koszul dual to each other, thus verifying a conjecture of Bernstein, Frenkel and Khovanov. Finally we use Koszul duality to give a short proof of the Enright-Shelton equivalence.
