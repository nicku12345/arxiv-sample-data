We study t-analogs of string functions for integrable highest weight representations of the affine Kac-Moody algebra A_1^{(1)}. We obtain closed form formulas for certain t-string functions of levels 2 and 4. As corollaries, we obtain explicit identities for the corresponding affine Hall-Littlewood functions, as well as higher-level generalizations of Cherednik's Macdonald and Macdonald-Mehta constant term identities.
