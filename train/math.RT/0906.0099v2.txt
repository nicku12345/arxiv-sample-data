We survey some important results concerning the finite--dimensional representations of the loop algebra of a simple complex Lie algebra, and their twisted loop subalgebras. In particular, we review the parametrization and description of the Weyl modules and of the irreducible finite--dimensional representations of such algebras, describe a block decomposition of the (non--semisimple) category of their finite--dimensional representations, and conclude with recent developments in the representation theory of multiloop algebras.
