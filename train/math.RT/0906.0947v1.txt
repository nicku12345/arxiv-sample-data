In this paper, as the first step towards classification of simple weight modules with finite dimensional weight spaces over Witt algebras W_n, we explicitly describe supports of such modules. We also obtain some descriptions on the support of an arbitrary simple weight module over a \Z^n-graded Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} having a root space decomposition \oplus_{\alpha\in\Z^n}\mathfrak {g}_\alpha with respect to the abelian subalgebra \mathfrak {g}_0, with the property [\mathfrak{g}_\alpha,\mathfrak {g}_\beta]= \mathfrak {g}_{\alpha+\beta} for all \alpha,\beta\in\Z^n, \alpha\neq \beta (this class contains the algebra W_n).
