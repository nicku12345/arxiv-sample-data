In an earlier paper by Kazhdan and the author, a map from the set of unipotent classes in a reductive connected group over C to the conjugacy classes in the Weyl group was defined. Here we present some experimental evidence for a possibly alternative definition of that map in terms of the pieces in certain partitions of the flag manifold.
