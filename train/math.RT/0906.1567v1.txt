We describe in the paper the graded centers of the derived categories of the derived discrete algebras. In particular, we prove that if A is a derived discrete algebra, then the reduced part of the graded center of the derived category of A is nontrivial if and only if A has infinite global dimension. Moreover, we show that the nilpotent part of the graded center is controlled by the objects for which the Auslander--Reiten translation coincides with a power of the suspension functor.
