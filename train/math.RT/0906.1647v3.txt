Let A and B be finite-dimensional k-algebras over a field k such that A/\rad(A) and B/\rad(B) are separable. In this note, we consider how to transfer a stable equivalence of Morita type between A and B to that between eAe and fBf, where e and f are idempotent elements in A and in B, respectively. In particular, if the Auslander algebras of two representation-finite algebras A and B are stably equivalent of Morita type, then A and B themselves are stably equivalent of Morita type. Thus, combining a result with Liu and Xi, we see that two representation-finite algebras A and B over a perfect field are stably equivalent of Morita type if and only if their Auslander algebras are stably equivalent of Morita type. Moreover, since stable equivalence of Morita type preserves n-cluster tilting modules, we extend this result to n-representation-finite algebras and n-Auslander algebras studied by Iyama.
