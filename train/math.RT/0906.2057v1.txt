Let \pi be an unitary irreducible representation of a Lie group G. \pi defines a moment set I_\pi, subset of the dual \mathfrak g^* of the Lie algebra of G. Unfortunately, I_\pi does not characterize \pi. However, we sometimes can find an overgroup G^+ for G, and associate, to \pi, a representation \pi^+ of G^+ in such a manner that I_{\pi^+} characterizes \pi, at least for generic representations \pi. If this construction is based on polynomial functions with degree at most 2, we say that G^+ is a quadratic overgroup for G. In this paper, we prove the existence of such a quadratic overgroup for many different classes of G.
