For a connected complex semi-simple Lie group G and a fixed pair (B, B^-) of opposite Borel subgroups of G, we determine when the intersection of a conjugacy class C in G and a double coset BwB^- is non-empty, where w is in the Weyl group W of G. The question comes from Poisson geometry, and our answer is in terms of the Bruhat order on W and an involution \mc \in W associated to C. We study properties of the elements \mc. For G = SL(n+1, \Cset), we describe \mc explicitly for every conjugacy class C, and for the case when w \in W is an involution, we also give an explicit answer to when C \cap (BwB) is non-empty.
