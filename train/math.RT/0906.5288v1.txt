Let \Lambda be an artin algebra with representation dimension equal to three and M an Auslander generator of \Lambda. We show how, under certain assumptions, we can mutate M to get a new Auslander generator whose endomorphism ring is derived equivalent to the endomorphism ring of M. We apply our results to selfinjective algebras with radical cube zero of infinite representation type, where we construct an infinite set of Auslander generators.
