We give a simple combinatorial criterion allowing to recognize whether a string (or, more generally, a special biserial) algebra is a laura algebra or not. We also show that a special biserial algebra is laura if and only if it has a finite number of isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules which have projective dimension and injective dimension greater than or equal to two, solving a conjecture ok Skowronski for special biserial algebras.
