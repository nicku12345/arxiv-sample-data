This is my PhD thesis submitted to the Weizmann Institute of Science. It is based on the papers [AG08c], [AG08d], [AGRS07], [AGS08], [AGS09], [Aiz08] and [SZ08].   This thesis includes an introduction to Gelfand pairs and invariant distributions, a list of tools to work with invariant distributions oriented towards proving Gelfand property and a proof that the pair (GL(n+1,F),GL(n,F)) is a strong Gelfand pair.   Namely, we prove that if \pi is an irreducible admissible smooth representation of GL(n+1,F) and \rho is an irreducible admissible smooth representation of GL(n,F) then   dim Hom_{GL(n,F)}(\pi,\rho)\leq 1.
