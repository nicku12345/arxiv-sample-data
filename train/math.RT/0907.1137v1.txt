Let G be a connected semi-simple algebraic group of adjoint type over an algebraically closed field, and let \overline{G} be the wonderful compactification of G. For a fixed pair (B, B^-) of opposite Borel subgroups of G, we look at intersections of Lusztig's G-stable pieces and the B^-\times B-orbits in \overline{G}, as well as intersections of B \times B-orbits and B^- \times B^--orbits in \overline{G}. We give explicit conditions for such intersections to be non-empty, and in each case, we show that every non-empty intersection is smooth and irreducible, that the closure of the intersection is equal to the intersection of the closures, and that the non-empty intersections form a strongly admissible partition of \overline{G}.
