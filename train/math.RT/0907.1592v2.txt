We determine the structure of the semisimple group algebra of certain groups over the rationals and over those finite fields where the Wedderburn decompositions have the least number of simple components. We apply our work to obtain similar information about the loop algebras of indecomposable RA loops and to produce negative answers to the isomorphism problem over various fields.
