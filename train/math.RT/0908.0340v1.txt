The lowest two-sided cell of the extended affine Weyl group W_e is the set \{w \in W_e: w = x \cdot w_0 \cdot z, \text{for some} x,z \in W_e\}, denoted W_{(\nu)}. We prove that for any w \in W_{(\nu)}, the canonical basis element \C_w can be expressed as \frac{1}{[n]!} \chi_\lambda({\y}) \C_{v_1 w_0} \C_{w_0 v_2}, where \chi_\lambda({\y}) is the character of the irreducible representation of highest weight \lambda in the Bernstein generators, and v_1 and v_2^{-1} are what we call primitive elements. Primitive elements are naturally in bijection with elements of the finite Weyl group W_f \subseteq W_e, thus this theorem gives an expression for any \C_w, w \in W_{(\nu)} in terms of only finitely many canonical basis elements. After completing this paper, we realized that this result was first proved by Xi in \cite{X}. The proof given here is significantly different and somewhat longer than Xi's, however our proof has the advantage of being mostly self-contained, while Xi's makes use of results of Lusztig from \cite{L Jantzen} and Cells in affine Weyl groups I-IV and the positivity of Kazhdan-Lusztig coefficients.
