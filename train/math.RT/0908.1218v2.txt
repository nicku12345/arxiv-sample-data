We provide a categorical interpretation of a well-known identity from linear algebra as an isomorphism of certain functors between triangulated categories arising from finite dimensional algebras.   As a consequence, we deduce that the Serre functor of a finite dimensional triangular algebra A has always a lift, up to shift, to a product of suitably defined reflection functors in the category of perfect complexes over the trivial extension algebra of A.
