The main purpose of this paper is to describe a symmetry in the set genuine parameters for even rank nonlinear Spin groups in type B at certain half-integral infinitesimal characters. This symmetry is used to establish a duality of the corresponding generalized Hecke modules and ultimately results in a character multiplicity duality of the induced genuine characters.
