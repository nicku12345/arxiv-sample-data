In this short paper, we study n-representation-finite algebras from the viewpoint of the fractionally Calabi-Yau property. We shall show that all n-representation-finite algebras are twisted fractionally Calabi-Yau. We also show that for any \ell>0, twisted \frac{n(\ell-1)}{\ell}-Calabi-Yau algebras of global dimension at most n are n-representation-finite. As an application, we give a construction of n-representation-finite algebras using the tensor product.
