We study the action of a real-reductive group G=K\exp(\lie{p}) on real-analytic submanifold X of a K\"ahler manifold Z. We suppose that the action of G extends holomorphically to an action of the complexified group G^\mbb{C} such that the action of a maximal Hamiltonian subgroup is Hamiltonian. The moment map \mu induces a gradient map \mu_\lie{p}\colon X\to\lie{p}. We show that \mu_\lie{p} almost separates the K--orbits if and only if a minimal parabolic subgroup of G has an open orbit. This generalizes Brion's characterization of spherical K\"ahler manifolds with moment maps.
