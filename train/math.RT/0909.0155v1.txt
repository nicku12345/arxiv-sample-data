We study Klyachko models of {\rm SL}(n, F), where F is a nonarchimedean local field. In particular, using results of Klyachko models for {\rm GL}(n, F) due to Heumos, Rallis, Offen and Sayag, we give statements of existence, uniqueness, and disjointness of Klyachko models for admissible representations of {\rm SL}(n, F), where the uniqueness and disjointness are up to specified conjugacy of the inducing character, and the existence is for unitarizable representations in the case F has characteristic 0. We apply these results to relate the size of an L-packet containing a given representation of {\rm SL}(n, F) to the type of its Klyachko model, and we describe when a self-dual unitarizable representation of {\rm SL}(n, F) is orthogonal and when it is symplectic.
