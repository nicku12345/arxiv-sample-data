Let p>3 be a prime, f a positive integer and Q_{p^f} the unramified extension of Q_p of degree f. After Breuil and Paskunas, to a generic semi-simple continue modulo p representation of the absolute Galois group of Q_{p^f}, we can associate a parameterized family of smooth admissible modulo p representations of GL_2(Q_{p^f}). In this article, we prove that there are more parameters than those known.
