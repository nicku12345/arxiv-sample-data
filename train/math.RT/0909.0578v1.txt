Given \Gamma a finite subgroup of \mathbf{SL}_3\mathbb{C}, we determine how an arbitrary finite dimensional irreducible representation of \mathbf{SL}_3\mathbb{C} decomposes under the action of \Gamma. To the subgroup \Gamma we attach a generalized Cartan matrix C_\Gamma. Then, inspired by B. Kostant, we decompose the Coxeter element of the Kac-Moody algebra attached to C_\Gamma as a product of reflections of a special form, thereby suggesting an algebraic form for the McKay correspondence in dimension 3.
