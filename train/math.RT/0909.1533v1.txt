We prove the conjectural endoscopic transfer of L-packets for the local Langlands correspondence for pure inner forms of unramified p-adic groups and depth-zero parameters established by DeBacker and Reeder. More precisely, we show that under mild conditions on the residual characteristic, endoscopic induction identifies an unstable character of such an L-packet with the stable character of the corresponding endoscopic L-packet.
