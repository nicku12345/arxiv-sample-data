We consider the variety of nilpotent elements in the dual of the Lie algebra of a reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field. We propose a definition of a partition of this variety into smooth locally closed smooth subvarieties indexed by the unipotent classes in the corresponding group over complex numbers. We obtain explicit results in type A,C and D.
