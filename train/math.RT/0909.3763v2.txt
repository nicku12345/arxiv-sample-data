We discuss Euler characteristics for finitely generated modules over Iwasawa algebras. We show that the Euler characteristic of a module is well-defined whenever the 0th homology group is finite if and only if the relevant compact p-adic Lie group is finite-by-nilpotent and that in this case all pseudo-null modules have trivial Euler characteristic. We also prove some other results relating to the triviality of Euler characteristics for pseudo-null modules.   We also prove some analogous results for the Akashi series of Coates et al.
