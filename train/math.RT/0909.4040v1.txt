We investigate the representations and the structure of Hecke algebras associated to certain finite complex reflection groups. We first describe computational methods for the construction of irreducible representations of these algebras, including a generalization of the concept of W-graph to the situation of complex reflection groups. We then use these techniques to find models for all irreducible representations in the case of complex reflection groups of dimension at most three. Using these models we are able to verify some important conjectures on the structure of Hecke algebras.
