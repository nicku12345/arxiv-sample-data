This paper is a representation-theoretic extension of Part I. It has been inspired by three recent developments: surface cluster algebras studied by Fomin-Shapiro-Thurston, the mutation theory of quivers with potentials initiated by Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky, and string modules associated to arcs on unpunctured surfaces by Assem-Brustle-Charbonneau-Plamondon. Modifying the latter construction, to each arc and each ideal triangulation of a bordered marked surface we associate in an explicit way a representation of the quiver with potential constructed in Part I, so that whenever two ideal triangulations are related by a flip, the associated representations are related by the corresponding mutation.
