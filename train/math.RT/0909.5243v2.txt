Using Lusztig's geometric classification, we find the reducibility points of a standard module for the affine Hecke algebra, in the case when the inducing data is generic. This recovers the known result of Muic-Shahidi for representations of split p-adic groups with Iwahori-spherical Whittaker vectors. We also give a necessary (insufficient) condition for reducibility in the non-generic case.
