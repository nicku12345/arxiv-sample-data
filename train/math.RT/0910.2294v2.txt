Let d and m be two natural numbers of distinct parities. Let \pi be an admissible irreducible tempered representation of GL(d,F), where F is a p-adic field. We assume that \pi is self-dual. Then we can extend \pi as a representation \tilde{\pi} of a non-connected group GL(d,F)\rtimes \{1,\theta\}. Let \rho be a representation of GL(m,F). We assume that it has similar properties as \pi. Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro and Shalika have defined the factor \epsilon(s,\pi\times\rho,\psi). We prove that we can compute \epsilon(1/2,\pi\times\rho,\psi) by an integral formula where occur the characters of \tilde{\pi} and \tilde{\rho}. It's similar to the formula which, for special orthogonal groups, computes the multiplicities appearing in the local Gross-Prasad conjecture.
