In this paper, we describe and study a mathematical framework for cryo-elecron microscopy. The main result, is a a proof of the admissability (correctness) and the numerical stability of the intrinsic reconstitution algorithm which was introduced by Singer and Shkolnisky in [7]. In addition, we explain how the various numerical observations reported in that work, follow from basic representation theoretic principles.
