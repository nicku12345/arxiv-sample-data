In this article we study the interplay between algebro-geometric notions related to \pi-points and structural features of the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of a finite group scheme. We show that \pi-points give rise to a number of new invariants of the AR-quiver on one hand, and exploit combinatorial properties of AR-components to obtain information on \pi-points on the other. Special attention is given to components containing Carlson modules, constantly supported modules, and endo-trivial modules.
