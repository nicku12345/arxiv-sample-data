We consider the set \Irr(W) of (complex) irreducible characters of a finite Coxeter group W. The Kazhdan--Lusztig theory of cells gives rise to a partition of \Irr(W) into "families" and to a natural partial order \leq_{\cLR} on these families. Following an idea of Spaltenstein, we show that \leq_{\cLR} can be characterised (and effectively computed) in terms of standard operations in the character ring of W. If, moreover, W is the Weyl group of an algebraic group G, then \leq_{\cLR} can be interpreted, via the Springer correspondence, in terms of the closure relation among the "special" unipotent classes of G.
