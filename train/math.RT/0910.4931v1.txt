We study the Schur elements and the a-function for cyclotomic Hecke algebras. As a consequence, we show the existence of canonical basic sets, as defined by Geck-Rouquier, for certain complex reflection groups. This includes the case of finite Weyl groups for all choices of parameters (in characteristic 0).
