For semisimple Lie superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, whose category of finite dimensional super representations is semisismple, we classify all irreducible super representations for which the alternating or symmetric square representation is irreducible or decomposes into an irreducible representation and a trivial representation.
