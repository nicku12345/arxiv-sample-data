This paper studies the existence of Auslander-Reiten sequences in subcategories of mod A, where A is a finite dimensional algebra over a field. The two main theorems give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Auslander-Reiten sequences in subcategories.   Let M be a subcategory of mod A closed under extensions and direct summands, and let X be an indecomposable module in M such that Ext^{1}(X, X') is not zero for some X' in M. Then the following are equivalent:   (i) DTrX has a precover in the stable category of mod A,   (ii) There exists an Auslander-Reiten sequence 0 --> U --> W --> X --> 0 in M.   We also have the dual result of the above theorem.
