Let k be a field, and let \Lambda be a finite dimensional k-algebra. We prove that if \Lambda is a self-injective algebra, then every finitely generated \Lambda-module V whose stable endomorphism ring is isomorphic to k has a universal deformation ring R(\Lambda,V) which is a complete local commutative Noetherian k-algebra with residue field k. If \Lambda is also a Frobenius algebra, we show that R(\Lambda,V) is stable under taking syzygies. We investigate a particular Frobenius algebra \Lambda_0 of dihedral type, as introduced by Erdmann, and we determine R(\Lambda_0,V) for every finitely generated \Lambda_0-module V whose stable endomorphism ring is isomorphic to k.
