We give a combinatorial description of the Springer correspondence for classical Lie algebras \mathfrak{g} of type B,C or D and their duals \mathfrak{g}^* in characteristic 2. The combinatorics used here is of the same kind as those appearing in the description of (generalized) Springer correspondence for unipotent case of classical groups G by Lusztig in odd characteristic and by Lusztig and Spaltentstein in characteristic 2. It is very nice that this combinatorics gives a unified description for (generalized) Springer correspondences of classical groups in all cases, namely, in G, \mathfrak{g} and \mathfrak{g}^* in all characteristics. Moreover, it gives rise to close formulas for computing the correspondences.
