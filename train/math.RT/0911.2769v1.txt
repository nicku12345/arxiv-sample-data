We compute the first cohomology of the ortosymplectic Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{osp}(1|2) on the (1,1)-dimensional real superspace with coefficients in the superspace \frak{D}_{\lambda,\nu;\mu} of bilinear differential operators acting on weighted densities. This work is the simplest superization of a result by Bouarroudj [Cohomology of the vector fields Lie algebras on \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1 acting on bilinear differential operators, International Journal of Geometric Methods in Modern Physics   (2005), {\bf 2}; N 1, 23-40].
