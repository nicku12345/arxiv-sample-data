Given a linear representation \rho : \mathfrak{g} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{g}\ell(V) of a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}, one can define a linear representation \rho_m : \mathfrak{g}_m \longrightarrow \mathfrak{g}\ell(V^m) of the generalized Takiff algebra \mathfrak{g}_m. It is proved here that the vector fields defined by \rho_m on V^m do have the Dixmier property if those defined by \rho have the same property. Examples where the result applies are given and in particular, those of the adjoint or coadjoint representations of Takiff algebras.
