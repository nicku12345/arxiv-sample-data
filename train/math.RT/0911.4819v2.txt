Associated with some finite dimensional algebras of global dimension at most 2, a generalized cluster category was introduced in \cite{Ami3}, which was shown to be triangulated and 2-Calabi-Yau when it is \Hom-finite. By definition, the cluster categories of \cite{Bua} are a special case. In this paper we show that a large class of 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories, including those associated with elements in Coxeter groups from \cite{Bua2}, are triangle equivalent to generalized cluster categories. This was already shown for some special elements in \cite{Ami3}.
