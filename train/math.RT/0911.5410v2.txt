Let Q be an acyclic quiver. Associated with any element w of the Coxeter group of Q, triangulated categories \underline{\Sub}\Lambda_w were introduced in \cite{Bua2}. There are shown to be triangle equivalent to generalized cluster categories \Cc_{\Gamma_w} associated to algebras \Gamma_w of global dimension \leq 2 in \cite{ART}. For w satisfying a certain property, called co-c-sortable, other algebras A_w of global dimension \leq 2 are constructed in \cite{AIRT} with a triangle equivalence \Cc_{A_w}\simeq \underline{\Sub}\Lambda_w. The main result of this paper is to prove that the algebras \Gamma_w and A_w are derived equivalent when w is co-c-sortable. The proof uses the 2-APR-tilting theory introduced in \cite{IO}.
