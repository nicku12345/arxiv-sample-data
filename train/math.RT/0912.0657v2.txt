Let Q be the 3-Kronecker quiver, i.e., Q has two vertices, labeled by 1 and 2, and three arrows from 2 to 1. Fix an algebraically closed field k. Let \mathcal{C} be a regular component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver containing an indecomposable module X with dimension (1,1) or (2,1). Using the properties of the Fibonacci numbers, we show that the Gabriel-Roiter measures of the indecomposable modules in \mathcal{C} are uniquely determined by the dimension vectors. In other words, two indecomposable modules in \mathcal{C} are not isomorphic if and only if their Gabriel-Roiter measures are different.
