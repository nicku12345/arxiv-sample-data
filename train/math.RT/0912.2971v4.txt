In this paper we study the second Hochschild cohomology group of the preprojective algebra of type D_4 over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic 2. We also calculate the second Hochschild cohomology group of a non-standard algebra which arises as a socle deformation of this preprojective algebra and so show that the two algebras are not derived equivalent. This answers a question raised by Holm and Skowro\'nski.
