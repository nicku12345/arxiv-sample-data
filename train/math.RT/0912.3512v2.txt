Let G be a semisimple, simply connected linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0. In a recent paper [4], Doty introduces the notion of r-minuscule weight and exhibits a tensor product factorization of a corresponding tilting module under the assumption p >= 2h-2, where h is the coxeter number. We remove this restriction and consider some variations involving the more general notion of (p,r)-minuscule weights.
