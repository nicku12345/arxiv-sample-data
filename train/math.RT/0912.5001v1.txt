Let \Lambda be an artin algebra and X a finitely generated \Lambda-module. Iyama has shown that there exists a module Y such that the endomorphism ring \Gamma of X\oplus Y is quasi-hereditary, with a heredity chain of length n, and that the global dimension of \Gamma is bounded by this n. In general, one only knows that a quasi-hereditary algebra with a heredity chain of length n must have global dimension at most 2n-2. We want to show that Iyama's better bound is related to the fact that the ring \Gamma he constructs is not only quasi-hereditary, but even left strongly quasi-hereditary: By definition, the left strongly quasi-hereditary algebras are the quasi-hereditary algebras with all standard left modules of projective dimension at most~1.
