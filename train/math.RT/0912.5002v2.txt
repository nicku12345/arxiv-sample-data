Let \Lambda be a finite-dimensional k-algebra with k algebraically closed. Bongartz has recently shown that the existence of an indecomposable \Lambda-module of length n > 1 implies that also indecomposable \Lambda-modules of length n-1 exist. Using a slight modification of his arguments, we strengthen the assertion as follows: If there is an indecomposable module of length n, then there is also an accessible one. Here, the accessible modules are defined inductively, as follows: First, the simple modules are accessible. Second, a module of length n \ge 2 is accessible provided it is indecomposable and there is a submodule or a factor module of length n-1 which is accessible.
