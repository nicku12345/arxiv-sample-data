Let \Lambda be an artin algebra. The aim of this paper is to outline a strong relationship between the Gabriel-Roiter inclusions and the Auslander-Reiten theory. If X is a Gabriel-Roiter submodule of Y, then Y is shown to be a factor module of an indecomposable module M such that there exists an irreducible monomorphism X \to M. We also will prove that the monomorphisms in a homogeneous tube are Gabriel-Roiter inclusions, provided the the tube contains a module whose endomorphism ring is a division ring.
