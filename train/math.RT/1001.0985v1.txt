In this paper we use topological techniques to construct generalized trace and modified dimension functions on ideals in certain ribbon categories. Examples of such ribbon categories naturally arise in representation theory where the usual trace and dimension functions are zero, but these generalized trace and modified dimension functions are non-zero. Such examples include categories of finite dimensional modules of certain Lie algebras and finite groups over a field of positive characteristic and categories of finite dimensional modules of basic Lie superalgebras over the complex numbers. These modified dimensions can be interpreted categorically and are closely related to some basic notions from representation theory.
