Let A be a tame hereditary algebra over a finite field k with q elements, and {\bar{A}} be the duplicated algebra of A. In this paper, we investigate the structure of Ringel-Hall algebra \mathscr{H} (\bar{A}) and of the corresponding composition algebra \mathscr{C} (\bar{A}). As an application, we prove the existence of Hall polynomials g_{XY}^M for any \bar{A}-modules M, X and Y with X and Y indecomposable if A is a tame quiver k-algebra, then we also obtain some Lie subalgebras induced by \bar{A}.
