Let H^*(\calB_e) be the cohomology of the Springer fibre for the nilpotent element e in a simple Lie algebra \g, on which the Weyl group W acts by the Springer representation. Let \Lambda^i V denote the ith exterior power of the reflection representation of W. We determine the degrees in which \Lambda^i V occurs in the graded representation H^*(\calB_e), under the assumption that e is regular in a Levi subalgebra and satisfies a certain extra condition which holds automatically if \g is of type A, B, or C. This partially verifies a conjecture of Lehrer--Shoji, and extends the results of Solomon in the e=0 case and Lehrer--Shoji in the i=1 case. The proof proceeds by showing that (H^*(\calB_e) \otimes \Lambda^* V)^W is a free exterior algebra on its subspace (H^*(\calB_e)\otimes V)^W.
