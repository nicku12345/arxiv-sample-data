In this paper, various polynomial representations of strange classical Lie superalgebras are investigated. It turns out that the representations for the algebras of type P are indecomposable, and we obtain the composition series of the underlying modules. As modules of the algebras of type Q, the polynomial algebras are decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible submodules.
