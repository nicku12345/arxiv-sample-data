Let G be a connected semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and let \th be an automorphism of G. We give a characterization of \th-twisted spherical conjugacy classes in G by a formula for their dimensions in terms of certain elements in the Weyl group of G, generalizing a result of N. Cantarini, G. Carnovale, and M. Costantini when \th is the identity automorphism. For G simple and \th an outer automorphism of G, we also classify the Weyl group elements that appear in the dimension formula.
