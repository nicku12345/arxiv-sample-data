Let Q be a wild n-Kronecker quiver, i.e., a quiver with two vertices, labeled by 1 and 2, and n\geq 3 arrows from 2 to 1. The indecomposable regular modules with preprojective Gabriel-Roiter submodules, in particular, those \tau^{-i}X with \udim X=(1,c) for i\geq 0 and some 1\leq c\leq n-1 will be studied. It will be shown that for each i\geq 0 the irreducible monomorphisms starting with \tau^{-i}X give rise to a sequence of Gabriel-Roiter inclusions, and moreover, the Gabriel-Roiter measures of those produce a sequence of direct successors. In particular, there are infinitely many GR-segments, i.e., a sequence of Gabriel-Roiter measures closed under direct successors and predecessors. The case n=3 will be studied in detail with the help of Fibonacci numbers. It will be proved that for a regular component containing some indecomposable module with dimension vector (1,1) or (1,2), the Gabriel-Roiter measures of the indecomposable modules are uniquely determined by their dimension vectors.
