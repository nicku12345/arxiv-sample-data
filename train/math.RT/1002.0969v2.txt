The irreducible representations of the Witt algebra W are completely known. A classification of the irreducible U_\chi(W)--modules was first established by Chang and later simplified by Strade. The aim of this article is to give a classification of the extensions of the simple U_\chi(W)--modules having p--character \chi of height -1,0,1 and p-1 where p denotes the characteristic of the ground field.
