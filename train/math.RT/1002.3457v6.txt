Let \Lambda be a dominant integral weight of level k for the affine Lie algebra \mathfrak g and let \alpha be a non-negative integral combination of simple roots. We address the question of whether the weight \eta=\Lambda-\alpha lies in the set P(\Lambda) of weights in the irreducible highest-weight module with highest weight \Lambda. We give a non-recursive criterion in terms of the coefficients of \alpha modulo an integral lattice kM, where M is the lattice parameterizing the abelian normal subgroup T of the Weyl group. The criterion requires the preliminary computation of a set no larger than the fundamental region for kM, and we show how this set can be efficiently calculated.
