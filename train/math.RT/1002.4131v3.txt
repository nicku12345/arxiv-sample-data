Let Q be an acyclic quiver and \Lambda be the complete preprojective algebra of Q over an algebraically closed field k. To any element w in the Coxeter group of Q, Buan, Iyama, Reiten and Scott have introduced and studied in \cite{Bua2} a finite dimensional algebra \Lambda_w=\Lambda/I_w. In this paper we look at filtrations of \Lambda_w associated to any reduced expression \mathbf{w} of w. We are especially interested in the case where the word \mathbf{w} is c-sortable, where c is a Coxeter element. In this situation, the consecutive quotients of this filtration can be related to tilting kQ-modules with finite torsionfree class.
