Let Q be a connected quiver with no oriented cycles, k the field of complex numbers and P a projective representation of Q. We study the adjoint action of the automorphism group \Aut_{kQ} P on the space of radical endomorphisms \radE_{kQ}P. Using generic equivalence, we show that the quiver Q has the property that there exists a dense open \Aut_{kQ} P-orbit in \radE_{kQ} P, for all projective representations P, if and only if Q is a Dynkin quiver. This gives a new characterisation of Dynkin quivers.
