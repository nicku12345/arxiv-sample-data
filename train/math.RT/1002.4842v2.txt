In association with a finite dimensional algebra A of global dimension two, we consider the endomorphism algebra of A, viewed as an object in the triangulated hull of the orbit category of the bounded derived category, in the sense of Amiot. We characterize the algebras A of global dimension two such that its endomorphism algebra is isomorphic to a cluster-tilted algebra with a cyclically oriented quiver.Furthermore, in the case that the cluster tilted algebra with a cyclically oriented quiver is of Dynkin or extended Dynkin type then A is derived equivalent to a hereditary algebra of the same type.
