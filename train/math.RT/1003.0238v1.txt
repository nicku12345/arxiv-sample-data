We discuss some connections between the closure \bar F of a Steinberg fiber in the wonderful compactification of an adjoint group and the affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties X_w(1) in the affine flag variety. Among other things, we describe the emptiness/nonemptiness pattern of X_w(1) if the translation part of w is quasi-regular. As a by-product, we give a new proof of the explicit description of \bar F, first obtained in \cite{H1}.
