We introduce thread quivers as an (infinite) generalization of quivers, and show that every k-linear (k algebraically closed) hereditary category with Serre duality and enough projectives is equivalent to the category of finitely presented representations of a thread quiver. In this way, we obtain an explicit construction of a new class of hereditary categories with Serre duality.
