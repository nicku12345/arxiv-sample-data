Suppose that Q is a finite quiver and G\subseteq \Aut(Q) is a finite group, k is an algebraic closed field whose characteristic does not divide the order of G. For any algebra \Lambda=kQ/{\mathcal {I}}, \mathcal {I} is an arbitrary ideal of path algebra kQ, we give all the indecomposable \Lambda G-modules from indecomposable \Lambda-modules when G is abelian. In particular, we apply this result to the deformed preprojective algebra \Pi_{Q}^{\lambda}, and get a reflection functor for the module category of \Pi_{Q}^{\lambda}G. Furthermore, we construct a new quiver Q_{G} and prove that \Pi_{Q}^{\lambda}G is Morita equivalent to \Pi_{Q_{G}}^{\eta} for some \eta.
