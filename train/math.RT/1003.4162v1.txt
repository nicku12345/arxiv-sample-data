Let Q be an algebraic group with q=\Lie Q and V a Q-module. The index of V is the minimal codimension of the Q-orbits in the dual space V^*. There is a general inequality, due to Vinberg, relating the index of V and the index of a Q_v-module V/q.v for v\in V. A pair (Q,V) is said to have GIB if Vinberg's inequality turns into an equality for all v\in V. In this article, we are interested in the GIB property of \theta-representations, where \theta is a finite order automorphism of a simple Lie algebra g. An automorphism of order m defines a Z/mZ-grading g=g_0+g_1+...+g_{m-1}. If G_0 is the identity component of G^\theta, then it acts on \gt g_1 and this action is called a \theta-representation. We classify inner automorphisms of gl_n and all finite order autmorphisms of the exceptional Lie algebras such that (G_0,g_1) has GIB and g_1 contains a semisimple element.
