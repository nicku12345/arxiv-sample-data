In this paper we consider the Hecke algebra \mathcal {H} associated to an extended affine Weyl group of type \widetilde{B_2}. We give some interesting formulas on C_{rt}S_{\lambda}, which imply some relations between the Kazhdan-Lusztig coefficients \mu (y,w) and representations of some algebraic groups. Here C_{rt} is one element in the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis of \mathcal {H} and S_{\lambda} is an element in the center of \mathcal {H}.
