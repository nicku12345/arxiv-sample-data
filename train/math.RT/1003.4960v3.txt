A triangulated category is said to be Calabi-Yau of dimension d if the dth power of its suspension is a Serre functor. We determine which stable categories of self-injective algebras A of finite representation type are Calabi-Yau and compute their Calabi-Yau dimensions. We achieve this by studying the minimal projective resolution of the stable Auslander algebra of A over its enveloping algebra, and use covering theory to reduce to (generalized) preprojective algebras of Dynkin graphs. We also describe how this problem can be approached by realizing the stable categories in question as orbit categories of the bounded derived categories of hereditary algebras.
