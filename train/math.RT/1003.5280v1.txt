We present a way to associate an algebra B_G (\Upsilon)  with every pseudo reflection group G. When G is a Coxeter group of simply-laced type we show B_G (\Upsilon) is isomorphic to the generalized Brauer algebra of simply-laced type introduced by Cohen,Gijsbers and Wales[10]. We prove B_G (\Upsilon) has a cellular structure and be semisimple for generic parameters when G is a rank 2 Coxeter group. In the process of construction we introduce a Cherednik type connection for BMW algebras and a generalization of Lawrence-Krammer representation to complex braid groups associated with all pseudo reflection groups.
