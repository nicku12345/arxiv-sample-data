We study selfadjoint functors acting on categories of finite dimensional modules over finite dimensional algebras with an emphasis on functors satisfying some polynomial relations. Selfadjoint functors satisfying several easy relations, in particular, idempotents and square roots of a sum of identity functors, are classified. We also describe various natural constructions for new actions using external direct sums, external tensor products, Serre subcategories, quotients and centralizer subalgebras.
