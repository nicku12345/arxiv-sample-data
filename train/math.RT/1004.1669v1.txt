Let g be a semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic 0 and O be a nilpotent orbit in g. Then Orb is a symplectic algebraic variety and one can ask whether it is possible to quantize \Orb (in an appropriate sense) and, if so, how to classify the quantizations. On the other hand, for the pair (g,O) one can construct an associative algebra W called a (finite) W-algebra. The goal of this paper is to clarify a relationship between quantizations of O (and of its coverings) and 1-dimensional W-modules. In the first approximation, our result is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two. The result is not new: it was discovered (in a different form) by Moeglin in the 80's.
