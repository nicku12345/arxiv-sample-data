The orbits of the group B of upper-triangular matrices acting on 2-nilpotent complex matrices via conjugation are classified via oriented link patterns, generalizing A. Melnikov's classification of the B-orbits on upper-triangular such matrices. The orbit closures as well as the "building blocks" of minimal degenerations of orbits are described. The classification uses the theory of representations of finite-dimensional algebras. Furthermore, we initiate the study of the B-orbits on arbitrary nilpotent matrices.
