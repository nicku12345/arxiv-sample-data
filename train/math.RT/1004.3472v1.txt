A GR-segment for an artin algebra is a sequence of Gabriel-Roiter measures, which is closed under direct predecessors and successors. The number of the GR-segments indexed by natural numbers \mathbb{N} and integers \mathbb{Z} probably relates to the representation types of artin algebras. Let k be an algebraically closed field and Q be a tame quiver (of type \widetilde{\mathbb{A}}_n, \widetilde{\mathbb{D}}_n, \widetilde{\mathbb{E}}_6, \widetilde{\mathbb{E}}_7, or \widetilde{\mathbb{E}}_8). Let b be the number of the isomorphism classes of the exceptional quasi-simple modules over the path algebra \Lambda=kQ. We show that the number of the \mathbb{N}- and \mathbb{Z}-indexed GR-segments in the central part for Q is bounded by b+1. Therefore, there are at most b+3 GR segments.
