We construct the Hasse diagrams G_2 and G_3 for the closure ordering on the sets of congruence classes of 2\times 2 and 3\times 3 complex matrices. In other words, we construct two directed graphs whose vertices are 2\times 2 or, respectively, 3\times 3 canonical matrices under congruence and there is a directed path from A to B if and only if A can be transformed by an arbitrarily small perturbation to a matrix that is congruent to B.   A bundle of matrices under congruence is defined as a set of square matrices A for which the pencils A+\lambda A^T belong to the same bundle under strict equivalence. In support of this definition, we show that all matrices in a congruence bundle of 2\times 2 or 3\times 3 matrices have the same properties with respect to perturbations. We construct the Hasse diagrams G_2^{\rm B} and G_3^{\rm B} for the closure ordering on the sets of congruence bundles of 2\times 2 and, respectively, 3\times 3 matrices. We find the isometry groups of 2\times 2 and 3\times 3 congruence canonical matrices.
