For each square complex matrix, V. I. Arnold constructed a normal form with the minimal number of parameters to which a family of all matrices B that are close enough to this matrix can be reduced by similarity transformations that smoothly depend on the entries of B. Analogous normal forms were also constructed for families of complex matrix pencils by A. Edelman, E. Elmroth, and B. Kagstrom, and contragredient matrix pencils (i.e., of matrix pairs up to transformations (A,B)-->(S^{-1}AR,R^{-1}BS)) by M. I. Garcia-Planas and V. V. Sergeichuk. In this paper we give other normal forms for families of matrices, matrix pencils, and contragredient matrix pencils; our normal forms are block triangular.
