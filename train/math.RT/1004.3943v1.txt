We give two new criteria for a basic algebra to be biserial. The first one states that an algebra is biserial iff all subalgebras of the form eAe where e is supported by at most 4 vertices are biserial. The second one gives some condition on modules that must not exist for a biserial algebra. These modules have properties similar to the module with dimension vector (1,1,1,1) for the path algebra of the quiver D_4. Both criteria generalize criteria for an algebra to be Nakayama. They rely on the description of a basic biserial algebra in terms of quiver and relations given by R. Vila-Freyer and W. Crawley- Boevey.
