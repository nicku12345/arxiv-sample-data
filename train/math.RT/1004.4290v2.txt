We prove that the Jacquet restriction functor for a parabolic subgroup of a reductive group over a non-Archimedean local field is right adjoint to the parabolic induction functor for the opposite parabolic subgroup, in the generality of smooth group representations on R-modules for any unital ring R in which the residue field characteristic is invertible.   Correction: it turned out that the paper contains a mistake (in Lemma 3.4), which the authors have been unable to fix. This renders the proof of the main theorem incomplete.
