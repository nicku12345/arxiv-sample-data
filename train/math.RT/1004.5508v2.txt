We consider a category of continuous Hilbert space representations and a category of smooth Frechet representations, of a real Jacobi group G. By Mackey's theory, they are respectively equivalent to certain categories of representations of a real reductive group \widetilde L. Within these categories, we show that the two functors of taking smooth vectors for G, and for \widetilde L, are consistent with each other. By using Casselman-Wallach's theory of smooth representations of real reductive groups, we define matrix coefficients for distributional vectors of certain representations of G. We also formulate Gelfand-Kazhdan criteria for Jacobi groups which could be used to prove the multiplicity one theorem for Fourier-Jacobi models.
