We contribute to the classification of finite dimensional algebras under stable equivalence of Morita type. More precisely we give a classification of the class of Erdmann's algebras of dihedral, semi-dihedral and quaternion type and obtain as byproduct the validity of the Auslander-Reiten conjecture for these classes of algebras.
