Using combinatorics of Young tableaux, we give an explicit construction of irreducible graded modules over Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras R and their cyclotomic quotients R^{\lambda} of type A_{n}. Our construction is compatible with crystal structure. Let {\mathbf B}(\infty) and {\mathbf B}(\lambda) be the U_q(\slm_{n+1})-crystal consisting of marginally large tableaux and semistandard tableaux of shape \lambda, respectively. On the other hand, let {\mathfrak B}(\infty) and {\mathfrak B}(\lambda) be the U_q(\slm_{n+1})-crystals consisting of isomorphism classes of irreducible graded R-modules and R^{\lambda}-modules, respectively. We show that there exist explicit crystal isomorphisms \Phi_{\infty}: {\mathbf B}(\infty) \overset{\sim} \longrightarrow {\mathfrak B}(\infty) and \Phi_{\lambda}: {\mathbf B}(\lambda) \overset{\sim} \longrightarrow {\mathfrak B}(\lambda).
