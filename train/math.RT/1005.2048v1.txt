We prove the Plancherel formula for Whittaker functions on a reductive p-adic group. This a sequel to our work on Paley-Wiener theorem. Our proof is close to the proof written by Waldspurger of the Harish-Chandra Plancherel formula for smooth functions on the group and use many of his results. One simplification is the easy proof of the Fourier transfom, which follows from a result of Joseph Bernstein.
