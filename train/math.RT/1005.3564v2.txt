We prove the existence of an m-cluster tilting object in a generalized m-cluster category which is (m+1)-Calabi-Yau and Hom-finite, arising from an (m+2)-Calabi-Yau dg algebra. This is a generalization of the result for the {m = 1} case in Amiot's Ph.~D.~thesis. Our results apply in particular to higher cluster categories associated to suitable finite-dimensional algebras of finite global dimension, and higher cluster categories associated to Ginzburg dg categories coming from suitable graded quivers with superpotential.
