We define the Higgs algebra \mathcal{H}_\P1 of the projective line, as a convolution algebra of constructible functions on the global nilpotent cone \underline{\Lambda}_\P1, a lagrangian substack of the Higgs bundle T^*\Coh_\P1, where \Coh_\P1 is the stack of coherent sheaves on \P1. We prove that \mathcal{H}_\P1 is isomorphic to (some completion of) U^+(\hat{sl}_2). We use this geometric realization to define a semicanonical basis of U^+(\hat{sl}_2), indexed by irreducible components of \underline{\Lambda}_\P1. We also construct a combinatorial data on this set of irreducible components in the spirit of \cite{KS}, which is an affine analog of a crystal. We call it a loop crystal and give some of its properties.
