In this paper we extend our previous results on wrapping Brownian motion and heat kernels onto compact Lie groups to various symmetric spaces, where a global generalisation of Rouvi\`ere's formula and the e-function are considered. Additionally, we extend some of our results to complex Lie groups, and certain non-compact symmetric spaces.
