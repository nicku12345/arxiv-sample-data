In this paper, we study the restriction of an irreducible unitary representation \pi of the universal covering \widetilde{Sp}_{2n}(\mb R) to a Heisenberg maximal parabolic group \tilde P. We prove that if \pi|_{\tilde P} is irreducible, then \pi must be a highest weight module or a lowest weight module. This is in sharp constrast with the GL_n(\mathbb R) case. In addition, we show that for a unitary highest or lowest weight module, \pi|_{\tilde P} decomposes discretely. We also treat the groups U(p,q) and O^*(2n).
