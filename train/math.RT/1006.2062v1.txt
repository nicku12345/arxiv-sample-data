We describe a new method to determine faithful representations of small dimension for a finite dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra. We give various applications of this method. In particular we find a new upper bound on the minimal dimension of a faithful module for the Lie algebras being counter examples to a well known conjecture of J. Milnor.
