We investigate several categories of integrable sl(\infty)-, o(\infty)-, sp(\infty)-modules. In particular, we prove that the category of integrable sl(\infty)-, o(\infty)-, sp(\infty)-modules with finite-dimensional weight spaces is semisimple. The most interesting category we study is the category \widetilde{\mathrm{Tens}}_{\mathfrak{g}} of tensor modules. Its objects M are defined as integrable modules of finite Loewy length such that the algebraic dual M^* is also integrable and of finite Loewy length.   We prove that the simple objects of \widetilde{\mathrm{Tens}}_{\mathfrak{g}} are precisely the simple tensor modules, i.e. the simple subquotients of the tensor algebra of the direct sum of the natural and conatural representations.   We also study injectives in \widetilde{\mathrm{Tens}}_{\mathfrak{g}} and compute the Ext^1's between simple modules. Finally, we characterize a certain subcategory \mathrm{Tens}_{\mathfrak{g}} of \widetilde{\mathrm{Tens}}_{\mathfrak{g}} as the unique minimal abelian full subcategory of the category of integrable modules which contains a non-trivial module and is closed under tensor product and algebraic dualization.
