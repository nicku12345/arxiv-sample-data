We give a new bijective interpretation of the Cauchy identity for Schur operators which is a commutation relation between two formal power series with operator coefficients. We introduce a plactic algebra associated with the Kashiwara's extremal weight crystals over the Kac-Moody algebra of type A_{+\infty}, and construct a Knuth type correspondence preserving the plactic relations. This bijection yields the Cauchy identity for Schur operators as a homomorphic image of its associated identity for plactic characters of extremal weight crystals, and also recovers the Sagan and Stanley's correspondence for skew tableaux as its restriction.
