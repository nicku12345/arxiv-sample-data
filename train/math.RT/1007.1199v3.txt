In this paper, we show that every quasiorder R induces a Nelson algebra \mathbb{RS} such that the underlying rough set lattice RS is algebraic. We note that \mathbb{RS} is a three-valued {\L}ukasiewicz algebra if and only if R is an equivalence. Our main result says that if \mathbb{A} is a Nelson algebra defined on an algebraic lattice, then there exists a set U and a quasiorder R on U such that \mathbb{A} \cong \mathbb{RS}.
