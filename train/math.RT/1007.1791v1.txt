Let R be the regular representation of a finite abelian group G and let C_n denote the cyclic group of order n. For G=C_n, we compute the Poincare series of all C_n-isotypic components in S^{\cdot} R\otimes \wedge^{\cdot} R (the symmetric tensor exterior algebra of R). From this we derive a general reciprocity and some number-theoretic identities. This generalises results of Fredman and Elashvili-Jibladze. Then we consider the Cayley table, M_G, of G and some generalisations of it. In particular, we prove that the number of formally different terms in the permanent of M_G equals (S^n R)^G, where n is the order of G.
