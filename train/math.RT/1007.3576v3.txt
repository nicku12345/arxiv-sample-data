Let F be a non--Archimedean locally compact field ({\rm car}(F)\geq 0), {\bf G} be a connected reductive group defined over F, \theta be an F--automorphism of {\bf G}, and \omega be a character of {\bf G}(F). We fix a Haar measure dg on {\bf G}(F). For a smooth irreducible (\theta,\omega)--stable complex representation \pi of {\bf G}(F), that is such that \pi\circ \theta\simeq \pi\otimes \omega, the choice of an isomorphism A from \pi\otimes \omega to \pi\circ \theta defines a distribution \Theta_\pi^A, called the \og (A--)twisted character of \pi\fg: for a compactly supported locally constant function f on {\bf G}(F), we put \Theta_\pi^A(f)={\rm trace}(\pi(fdg)\circ A). In this paper, we study these distributions \Theta_\pi^A, without any restrictive hypothesis on F, {\bf G} or \theta. We prove in particular that the restriction of \Theta_\pi^A on the open dense subset of {\bf G}(F) formed of those elements which are \theta--quasi--regular is given by a locally constant function, and we describe how this function behaves with respect to parabolic induction and Jacquet restriction. This leads us to take up again the Steinberg theory of automorphisms of an algebraic group, from a rationnal point of view.
