Let N be the Heisenberg group. We consider left-invariant multiplicity free subspaces of L^2(N). We prove a necessary and sufficient density condition in order that such subspaces possess the interpolation property with respect to a class of discrete subsets of N that includes the integer lattice. We exhibit a concrete example of a subspace that has interpolation for the integer lattice, and we also prove a necessary and sufficient condition for shift invariant subspaces to possess a singly-generated orthonormal basis of translates.
