Let R be a root datum with affine Weyl group W^e, and let H = H (R,q) be an affine Hecke algebra with positive, possibly unequal, parameters q. Then H is a deformation of the group algebra \mathbb C [W^e], so it is natural to compare the representation theory of H and of W^e.   We define a map from irreducible H-representations to W^e-representations and we show that, when extended to the Grothendieck groups of finite dimensional representations, this map becomes an isomorphism, modulo torsion. The map can be adjusted to a (nonnatural) continuous bijection from the dual space of H to that of W^e. We use this to prove the affine Hecke algebra version of a conjecture of Aubert, Baum and Plymen, which predicts a strong and explicit geometric similarity between the dual spaces of H and W^e.   An important role is played by the Schwartz completion S = S (R,q) of H, an algebra whose representations are precisely the tempered H-representations. We construct isomorphisms \zeta_\epsilon : S (R,q^\epsilon) \to S (R,q) (\epsilon >0) and injection \zeta_0 : S (W^e) = S (R,q^0) \to S (R,q), depending continuously on \epsilon.   Although \zeta_0 is not surjective, it behaves like an algebra isomorphism in many ways. Not only does \zeta_0 extend to a bijection on Grothendieck groups of finite dimensional representations, it also induces isomorphisms on topological K-theory and on periodic cyclic homology (the first two modulo torsion). This proves a conjecture of Higson and Plymen, which says that the K-theory of the C^*-completion of an affine Hecke algebra H (R,q) does not depend on the parameter(s) q.
