We characterize locally semisimple subalgebras \l of \sl_\infty, \so_\infty, and \sp_\infty which are Levi components of parabolic subalgebras. Given \l, we characterize the parabolic subalgebras \p such that \l is a Levi component of \p. When the set of such self-normalizing parabolic subalgebras \p is finite, we prove an estimate on its cardinality. We consider various examples which highlight the differences from the case of parabolic subalgebras of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras.
