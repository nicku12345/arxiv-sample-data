The Lawrence-Krammer representation was used in 2000 to show the linearity of the braid group. The problem had remained open for many years. The fact that the Lawrence-Krammer representation of the braid group is reducible for some complex values of its two parameters is now known, as well as the complete description of these values under some restrictions on one of the parameters. It is also known that when the representation is reducible, the action on a proper invariant subspace is an Iwahori-Hecke algebra action. In this paper, we prove a theorem of classification for the invariant subspaces of the Lawrence-Krammer space. We classify the proper invariant subspaces in terms of Specht modules. We fully describe them in terms of dimension and spanning vectors in the Lawrence-Krammer space.
