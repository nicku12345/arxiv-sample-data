We propose a new realization, using Harish-Chandra bimodules, of the Serre functor for the BGG category \mathcal{O} associated to a semi-simple complex finite dimensional Lie algebra. We further show that our realization carries over to classical Lie superalgebras in many cases. Along the way we prove that category \mathcal{O} and its parabolic generalizations for classical Lie superalgebras are categories with full projective functors. As an application we prove that in many cases the endomorphism algebra of the basic projective-injective module in (parabolic) category \mathcal{O} for classical Lie superalgebras is symmetric. As a special case we obtain that in these cases the algebras describing blocks of the category of finite dimensional modules are symmetric. We also compute the latter algebras for the superalgebra \mathfrak{q}(2).
