The Harish-Chandra--Howe local character expansion expresses the characters of reductive, p-adic groups in terms of Fourier transforms of nilpotent orbital integrals on their Lie algebras, and Murnaghan--Kirillov theory expresses many characters of reductive, p-adic groups in terms of Fourier transforms of semisimple orbital integrals (also on their Lie algebras). In many cases, the evaluation of these Fourier transforms seems intractable; but, for \operatorname{SL}_2, the nilpotent orbital integrals have already been computed. In this paper, we use a variant of Huntsinger's integral formula, and the theory of p-adic special functions, to compute semisimple orbital integrals.
