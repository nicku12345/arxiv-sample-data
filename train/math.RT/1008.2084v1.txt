We define and investigate the concept of the groupoid representation induced by a representation of the isotropy subgroupoid. Groupoids in question are locally compact transitive topological groupoids. We formulate and prove the imprimitivity theorem for such representations which is a generalization of the classical Mackey's theorem known from the theory of group representations.
