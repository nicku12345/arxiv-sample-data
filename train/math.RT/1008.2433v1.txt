We obtain a realization of the Lie superalgebra D(2, 1 ; \alpha) in differential operators on the supercircle S^{1|2} and in 4\times 4 matrices over a Weyl algebra. A contraction of D(2, 1 ; \alpha) is isomorphic to the universal central extension \hat{\p\s\l}(2|2) of \p\s\l(2|2). We realize it in 4\times 4 matrices over the associative algebra of pseudodifferential operators on S^1. Correspondingly, there exists a three-parameter family of irreducible representations of \hat{\p\s\l}(2|2) in a (2|2)--dimensional complex superspace.
