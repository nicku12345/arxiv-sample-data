We describe the infinitesimal deformations of the standard embedding of the Lie superalgebra D(2, 1 ; \alpha) into the Poisson superalgebra of pseudodifferential symbols on S^{1|2}. We show that for the standard embedding of D(2, 1 ; \alpha) into the Poisson superalgebra of differential operators on S^{1|2}, the infinitesimal deformations correspond to formal deformations. For the embedding of D(2, 1 ; \alpha) into the derived contact superconformal algebra {K}'(4), the infinitesimal deformations are formal deformations.
