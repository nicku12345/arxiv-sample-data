We reformulate the inductive McKay condition, from Isaacs-Malle-Navarro, and apply the new criterion to simple groups of Lie type, when the prime is the defining characteristic p. Thereby we make use of a recent result of Maslowski. This proves that these simple group satisfy the inductive McKay condition for p. In the non simply-laced types and non-classical types this reproves earlier results by Brunat and Brunat-Himstedt.
