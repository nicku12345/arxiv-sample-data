We prove spectral analogues of the classical strong multiplicity one theorem for newforms. Let \Gamma_1 and \Gamma_2 be uniform lattices in a semisimple group G. Suppose all but finitely many irreducible unitary representations (resp. spherical) of G occur with equal multiplicities in L^{2}(\Gamma_1 \backslash G) and L^{2}(\Gamma_2 \backslash G). Then L^{2}(\Gamma_1 \backslash G) \cong L^{2}(\Gamma_2 \backslash G) as G - modules (resp. the spherical spectra of L^{2}(\Gamma_1 \backslash G) and L^{2}(\Gamma_2 \backslash G) are equal).
