Let V be a finite-dimensional FG-module, where F is a field of prime characteristic p and G is a group. We show that, when r is not a power of p, the Lie power L^r(V) has a direct summand B^r(V) which is a direct summand of the tensor power V^{\otimes r} and which satisfies \dim B^r(V)/\dim L^r(V) \to 1 as r \to \infty. Similarly, for the same values of r, we obtain a projective submodule C(r) of the Lie module \Lie(r) over F such that \dim C(r)/\dim \Lie(r) \to 1 as r \to \infty.
