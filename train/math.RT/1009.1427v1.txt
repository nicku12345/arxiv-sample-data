Simple-minded systems in stable module categories are defined by orthogonality and generating properties so that the images of the simple modules under a stable equivalence form such a system. Simple-minded systems are shown to be invariant under stable equivalences; thus the set of all simple-minded systems is an invariant of a stable module category. The simple-minded systems of several classes of algebras are described and connections to the Auslander-Reiten conjecture are pointed out.
