We show that a finite connected quiver Q with no oriented cycles is tame if and only if for each dimension vector \mathbf{d} and each integral weight \theta of Q, the moduli space \mathcal{M}(Q,\mathbf{d})^{ss}_{\theta} of \theta-semi-stable \mathbf{d}-dimensional representations of Q is just a projective space. In order to prove this, we show that the tame quivers are precisely those whose weight spaces of semi-invariants satisfy a certain log-concavity property. Furthermore, we characterize the tame quivers as being those quivers Q with the property that for each Schur root \mathbf{d} of Q, the field of rational invariants k(rep(Q,\mathbf{d}))^{GL(\mathbf{d})} is isomorphic to k or k(t). Next, we extend this latter description to canonical algebras. More precisely, we show that a canonical algebra \Lambda is tame if and only if for each generic root \mathbf{d} of \Lambda and each indecomposable irreducible component C of rep(\Lambda,\mathbf{d}), the field of rational invariants k(C)^{GL(\mathbf{d})} is isomorphic to k or k(t). Along the way, we establish a general reduction technique for studying fields of rational invariants on Schur irreducible components of representation varieties.
