We show that Kerov's central limit theorem related to the fluctuations of Young diagrams under the Plancherel measure extends to the case of Schur-Weyl measures, which are the probability measures on partitions associated to the representations of the symmetric groups S_n on tensor products of vector spaces V^{\otimes n} (cf. arXiv:math/0006111). More precisely, the fluctuations are exactly the same up to a translation of the diagrams along the x-axis. Our proof is inspired by the one given by Ivanov and Olshanski in arXiv:math/0304010 for the Plancherel measure, and it relies on the combinatorics of the algebra of observable of diagrams. We also use Sniady's theory of cumulants of observables, cf. arXiv:math/0501112.
