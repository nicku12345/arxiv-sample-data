If a partition \lambda of size n is chosen randomly according to the Plancherel measure P_n[\lambda] = (\dim \lambda)^2/n!, then as n goes to infinity, the rescaled shape of \lambda is with high probability very close to a non-random continuous curve \Omega known as the Logan-Shepp-Kerov-Vershik curve. Moreover, the rescaled deviation of \lambda from this limit shape can be described by an explicit generalized gaussian process. In this paper, we investigate the analoguous problem when \lambda is chosen with probability proportional to \dim \lambda instead of (\dim \lambda)^2. We shall use very general arguments due to Ivanov and Olshanski for the first and second order asymptotics (cf. arXiv:math/0304010); these arguments amount essentially to a method of moments in a noncommutative setting. The first order asymptotics of the Gelfand measures turns out to be the same as for the Plancherel measure; on the contrary, the fluctuations are different (and bigger), although they involve the same generalized gaussian process. Many of our computations relie on the enumeration of involutions and square roots in S_n.
