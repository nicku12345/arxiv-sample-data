We show the q-analog of a well-known result of Farahat and Higman: in the center of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra H_{n,q}, if (a_{\lambda\mu}^{\nu}(n,q))_\nu is the set of structure constants involved in the product of two Geck-Rouquier conjugacy classes \Gamma_{\lambda,n} and \Gamma_{\mu,n}, then each coefficient a_{\lambda\mu}^{\nu}(n,q) depends on n and q in a polynomial way. Our proof relies on the construction of a projective limit of the Hecke algebras; this projective limit is inspired by the Ivanov-Kerov algebra of partial permutations.
