Let \mathfrak{g} be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra and M be a \mathfrak{g}-module. The Fernando-Kac subalgebra of \mathfrak{g} associated to M is the subset \mathfrak{g}[M]\subset\mathfrak{g} of all elements g\in\mathfrak{g} which act locally finitely on M. A subalgebra \mathfrak{l}\subset\mathfrak{g} for which there exists an irreducible module M with \mathfrak{g}[M]=\mathfrak{l} is called a Fernando-Kac subalgebra of \mathfrak{g}. A Fernando-Kac subalgebra of \mathfrak{g} is of finite type if in addition M can be chosen to have finite Jordan-H\"older \mathfrak{l}-multiplicities. Under the assumption that \mathfrak{g} is simple, I. Penkov has conjectured an explicit combinatorial criterion describing all Fernando-Kac subalgebras of finite type which contain a Cartan subalgebra. In the present paper we prove this conjecture for \mathfrak{g}\neq E_8.
