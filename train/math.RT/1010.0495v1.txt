Let g be the Lie algebra of a connected, simply connected semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of sufficiently large positive characteristic. We study the compatibility between the Koszul grading on the restricted enveloping algebra (Ug)_0 of g constructed in a previous paper, and the structure of Frobenius algebra of (Ug)_0. This answers a question raised to the author by W. Soergel.
