Let \Lambda be an Artin algebra. A GR segment of \Lambda is a sequence of GR measures which is closed under direct successors and direct predecessors. The number of the GR segments was conjectured to relate to the representation type of \Lambda. In this paper, let k be an algebraically closed field and \Lambda be a finite-dimensional hereditary k-algebra. We show that \Lambda admits infinitely many GR segments if and only if \Lambda is of wild representation type. Thus the finiteness of the number of the GR segments might be an alternative characterization of the tameness of finite dimensional algebras over algebraically closed fields. Therefore, this might give a possibility to generalize Drozd's tameness and wildness to arbitrary Artin algebras.
