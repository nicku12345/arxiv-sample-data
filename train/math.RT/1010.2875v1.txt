Discrete series Whittaker functions on Spin(2n, 2) are studied. The dimensions of the space of both algebraic and continuous Whittaker models are explicitly determined. They are described by a sum of dimensions of irreducible representations of Spin(2n-3, 2). Also obtained are the Mellin-Barnes type integral formulas of the Whittaker functions associated with minimal K-type vectors.
