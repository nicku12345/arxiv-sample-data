In this paper we evaluate Chebyshev polynomials of the second-kind on a class of symmetric integer matrices, namely on adjacency matrices of simply laced Dynkin and extended Dynkin diagrams. As an application of these results we explicitly calculate minimal projective resolutions of simple modules of symmetric algebras with radical cube zero that are of finite and tame representation type.
