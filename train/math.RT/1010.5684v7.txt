For any Carter diagram \Gamma containing 4-cycle, we introduce the partial Cartan matrix B_L, which is similar to the Cartan matrix associated with a Dynkin diagram. A linkage diagram is obtained from \Gamma by adding one root together with its bonds such that the resulting subset of roots is linearly independent. The linkage diagrams connected under the action of dual partial Weyl group (associated with B_L) constitute the linkage system, which is similar to the weight system arising in the representation theory of the semisimple Lie algebras. For Carter diagrams E_6(a_i) and E_6 (resp. E_7(a_i) and E_7; resp. D_n(a_i) and D_n), the linkage system has, respectively, 2, 1, 1 components, each of which contains, respectively, 27, 56, 2n elements. Numbers 27, 56 and 2n are well-known dimensions of the smallest fundamental representations of semisimple Lie algebras, respectively, for E_6, E_7 and D_n. The 8-cell "spindle-like" linkage subsystems called loctets play the essential role in describing the linkage systems. It turns that weight systems also can be described by means of loctets.
