Let \pi, \pi' be tempered representations of an affine Hecke algebra with positive parameters. We study their Euler--Poincar\'e pairing EP (\pi,\pi'), the alternating sum of the dimensions of the Ext-groups. We show that EP (\pi,\pi') can be expressed in a simple formula involving an analytic R-group, analogous to a formula of Arthur in the setting of reductive p-adic groups. Our proof applies equally well to affine Hecke algebras and to reductive groups over nonarchimedean local fields of arbitrary characteristic.
