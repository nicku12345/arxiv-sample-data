The generalized p-characters for the restricted Lie color are defined. The simplicity of the induced modules for the FP triples are determined. As applications, we have obtained an analogue of the Kac-Weisfiler theorem for the algebraic Lie color algebra cgl(V), also determined the simplicity of the baby Verma modules for cgl(V).
