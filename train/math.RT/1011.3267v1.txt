Let G be a complex simple Lie group and let \g = \hbox{\rm Lie}\,G. Let S(\g) be the G-module of polynomial functions on \g and let \hbox{\rm Sing}\,\g be the closed algebraic cone of singular elements in \g. Let {\cal L}\s S(\g) be the (graded) ideal defining \hbox{\rm Sing}\,\g and let 2r be the dimension of a G-orbit of a regular element in \g. Then {\cal L}^k = 0 for any k<r. On the other hand, there exists a remarkable G-module M\s {\cal L}^r which already defines \hbox{\rm Sing}\,\g. The main results of this paper are a determination of the structure of M.
