In this paper, we describe the irreducible representations in category O of the rational Cherednik algebra H_c(G_12,h) associated to the complex reflection group G_12 with reflection representation h for an arbitary complex parameter c. In particular, we determine the irreducible finite dimensional representations and compute their characters.
