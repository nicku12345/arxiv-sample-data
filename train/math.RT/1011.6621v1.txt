A holomorphic continuation of Jacquet type integrals for parabolic subgroups with abelian nilradical is studied. Complete results are given for generic characters with compact stabilizer and arbitrary representations induced from admissible representations. A description of all of the pertinent examples is given. These results give a complete description of the Bessel models corresponding to compact stabilizer.
