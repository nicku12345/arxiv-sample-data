The u-homology formulas for unitarizable modules at negative levels over classical Lie algebras of infinite rank of types gl(n), sp(2n) and so(2n) are obtained. As a consequence, we recover the Enright's formulas for three Hermitian symmetric pairs of classical types (SU(p; q); SU(p) X SU(q)), (Sp(2n);U(n)) and (SO*(2n);U(n)).
