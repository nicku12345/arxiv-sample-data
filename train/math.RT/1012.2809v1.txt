The main result of this article is an application of the theory of invariant convex cones of Lie algebras to the study of unitary representations of Lie supergroups. It also includes an exposition of recent results of the second author on the classification of irreducible unitary representations of nilpotent Lie supergroups using the method of coadjoint orbits.
