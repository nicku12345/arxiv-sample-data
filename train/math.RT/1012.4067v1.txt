In this thesis, we investigate the asymptotics of random partitions chosen according to probability measures coming from the representation theory of the symmetric groups S_n and of the finite Chevalley groups GL(n,F_q) and Sp(2n,F_q). More precisely, we prove laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for the q-Plancherel measures of type A and B, the Schur-Weyl measures and the Gelfand measures. Using the RSK algorithm, it also gives results on longest increasing subsequences in random words. We develop a technique of moments (and cumulants) for random partitions, thereby using the polynomial functions on Young diagrams in the sense of Kerov and Olshanski. The algebra of polynomial functions, or observables of Young diagrams is isomorphic to the algebra of partial permutations; in the last part of the thesis, we try to generalize this beautiful construction.
