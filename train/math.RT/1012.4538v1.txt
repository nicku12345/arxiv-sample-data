We propose a relative trace formula approach and state the corresponding fundamental lemma toward the global restriction problem involving Bessel or Fourier-Jacobi periods of unitary groups \mathrm{U}_n\times\mathrm{U}_m, extending the work of Jacquet-Rallis for m=n-1 (which is a Bessel period). In particular, when m=0, we recover a relative trace formula proposed by Flicker concerning Kloosterman/Fourier integrals on quasi-split unitary groups. As evidence for our approach, we prove the fundamental lemma for \mathrm{U}_n\times\mathrm{U}_n in positive characteristics.
