By using perverse sheaves on representation spaces of quivers over k[t]/(t^n) and jet schemes over flag varieties, we construct a geometric composition algebra \mathbf K under Lusztig's framework on geometric realizations of the negative part of quantum algebras. Simple perverse sheaves in \mathbf K form the canonical basis of \mathbf K. The relationships among the algebra \mathbf K, the composition algebra of locally projective representations of quivers over k[t]/(t^n) and quantum generalized Kac-Moody algebra are provided.
