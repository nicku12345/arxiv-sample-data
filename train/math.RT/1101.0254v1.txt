The Lie module of the group algebra FS_n of the symmetric group is known to be not projective if and only if the characteristic p of F divides n. We show that in this case its non-projective summands belong to the principal block of FS_n.   Let V be a vector space of dimension m over F, and let L^n(V) be the n-th homogeneous part of the free Lie algebra on V; this is a polynomial representation of GL_m(F) of degree n, or equivalently, a module of the Schur algebra S(m,n). Our result implies that, when m \geq n, every summand of L^n(V) which is not a tilting module belongs to the principal block of S(m,n), by which we mean the block containing the n-th symmetric power of V.
