Let \frak g be a reductive Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and \frak k be a reductive in \frak g-subalgebra. Let M be a finitely generated (possibly, infinite-dimensional) \frak g-module. We say that M is a (\frak g, \frak k)-module if M is a direct sum of a (possibly, infinite) amount of simple finite-dimensional \frak k-modules. We say that M is of finite type if M is a (\frak g, \frak k)-module and Hom_\frak k(V, M)<\infty for any simple \frak k-module V.   Let X be a variety of all Borel subalgebras of \frak g. Let M be a finitely generated (\frak g, \frak k)-module of finite type. In this article we prove that M is holonomic, i.e. M is governed by some subvariety L_M\subset X and some local system S_M on it. Furthermore we provide a finite list in which L_M necessarily appear.
