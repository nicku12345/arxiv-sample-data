The paper presents a subclass of the class of MD5-algebras and MD5-groups, i.e. five dimensional solvable Lie algebras and Lie groups such that their orbits in the co-adjoint representation (K-orbits) are orbits of zero or maximal dimension. The main result of the paper is the classification up to an isomorphism of all MD5-algebras with the non-commutative derived ideal. With this result, we have the complete classification of 5-dimensional solvable Lie algebras.
