Let G be a complex simply-connected semisimple Lie group and let \g= \hbox{\rm Lie}\,G. Let \g = \n_- +\hh + \n be a triangular decomposition of \g. The authors in [LW] introduce a very nice representation theory idea for the construction of certain elements in \hbox{\rm cent}\,U(n). A key lemma in [LW] is incorrect but the idea is in fact valid. In our paper here we modify the construction so as to yield the desired elements in \hbox{\rm cent}\,U(\n).
