Generalizing the proof -- by Hecht and Schmid -- of Osborne's conjecture we prove an Archimedean (and weaker) version of a theorem of Colette Moeglin. The result we obtain is a precise Archimedean version of the general principle -- stated by the second author -- according to which {\it a local Arthur packet contains the corresponding local L-packet and representations which are more tempered.}
