This paper deals with the problem of factorizing integer powers of the Laplace operator acting on functions taking values in higher spin representations. This is a far-reaching generalization of the well-known fact that the square of the Dirac operator is equal to the Laplace operator. Using algebraic properties of projections of Stein-Weiss gradients, i.e. generalized Rarita-Schwinger and twistor operators, we give a sharp upper bound on the order of polyharmonicity for functions with values in a given representation with half-integral highest weight.
