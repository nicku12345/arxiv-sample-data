We study the homomorphism spaces between Specht modules for the Hecke algebras \h of type A. We prove a cellular analogue of the kernel intersection theorem and a q-analogue of a theorem of Fayers and Martin and apply these results to give an algorithm which computes the homomorphism spaces \Hom_{\h}(S^\mu,S^\lambda) for certain pairs of partitions \lambda and \mu. We give an explicit description of the homomorphism spaces \Hom_\h(S^\mu,S^\lambda) where \h is an algebra over the complex numbers, \lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2) and \mu is an arbitrary partition with \mu_1 \geq \lambda_2.
