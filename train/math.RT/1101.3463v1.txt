We study the Segal-Bargmann transform, or the heat transform, H_t for a compact symmetric space M=U/K. We prove that H_t is a unitary isomorphism H_t : L^2(M) \to \cH_t (M_\C) using representation theory and the restriction principle. We then show that the Segal-Bargmann transform behaves nicely under propagation of symmetric spaces. If \{M_n=U_n/K_n,\iota_{n,m}\}_n is a direct family of compact symmetric spaces such that M_m propagates M_n, m\ge n, then this gives rise to direct families of Hilbert spaces \{L^2(M_n),\gamma_{n,m}\} and \{\cH_t(M_{n\C}),\delta_{n,m}\} such that H_{t,m}\circ \gamma_{n,m}=\delta_{n,m}\circ H_{t,n}. We also consider similar commutative diagrams for the K_n-invariant case. These lead to isometric isomorphisms between the Hilbert spaces \varinjlim L^2(M_n)\simeq \varinjlim \mathcal{H} (M_{n\mathbb{C}}) as well as \varinjlim L^2(M_n)^{K_n}\simeq \varinjlim \mathcal{H} (M_{n\mathbb{C}})^{K_n}.
