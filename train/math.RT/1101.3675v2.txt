Cluster categories have been introduced by Buan, Marsh, Reineke, Reiten and Todorov in order to categorify Fomin-Zelevinsky cluster algebras. This survey motivates and outlines the construction of a generalization of cluster categories, and explains different applications of these new categories in representation theory.
