nspired by the work of J\orgensen [J], we define a (upper-, lower-) symmetric recollements; and give a one-one correspondence between the equivalent classes of the upper-symmetric recollements and one of the lower-symmetric recollements, of a triangulated category. Let \m = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} A&M 0&B \end{smallmatrix}\right) with bimodule _AM_B. We construct an upper-symmetric abelian category recollement of \m-mod; and a symmetric triangulated category recollement of \underline {\m\mbox{-}\mathcal Gproj} if A and B are Gorenstein and _AM and M_B are projective.
