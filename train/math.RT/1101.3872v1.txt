The monomorphism category \mathcal S_n(\mathcal X) is introduced, where \mathcal X is a full subcategory of the module category A-mod of Artin algebra A. The key result is a reciprocity of the monomorphism operator \mathcal S_n and the left perpendicular operator ^\perp: for a cotilting A-module T, there is a canonical construction of a cotilting T_n(A)-module {\rm \bf m}(T), such that \mathcal S_n(^\perp T) = \ ^\perp {\rm \bf m}(T).   As applications, \mathcal S_n(\mathcal X) is a resolving contravariantly finite subcategory in T_n(A)-mod with \hat{\mathcal S_n(\mathcal X)} = T_n(A)-mod if and only if \mathcal X is a resolving contravariantly finite subcategory in A-mod with \hat{\mathcal X} = A-mod. For a Gorenstein algebra A, the category T_n(A)\mbox{-}\mathcal Gproj of Gorenstein-projective T_n(A)-modules can be explicitly determined as \mathcal S_n(^\perp A). Also, self-injective algebras A can be characterized by the property T_n(A)\mbox{-}\mathcal Gproj = \mathcal S_n(A). Using \mathcal S_n(A)= \ ^\perp {\rm \bf m}(D(A_A)), a characterization of \mathcal S_n(A) of finite type is obtained.
