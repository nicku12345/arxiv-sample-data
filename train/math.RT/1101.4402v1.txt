We revisit with another view point the construction by R. Brylinski and B. Kostant of minimal representations of simple Lie groups. We start from a pair (V,Q), where V is a complex vector space and Q a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 on V. The manifold \Xi  is an orbit of a covering of {\rm Conf}(V,Q), the conformal group of the pair (V,Q), in a finite dimensional representation space. By a generalized Kantor-Koecher-Tits construction we obtain a complex simple Lie algebra \goth g, and furthermore a real form {\goth g}_{\bboard R}. The connected and simply connected Lie group G_{\bboard R} with {\rm Lie}(G_{\bboard R})={\goth g}_{\bboard R} acts unitarily on a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions defined on the manifold \Xi
