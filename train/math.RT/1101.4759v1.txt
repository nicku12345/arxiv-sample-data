We construct spherical subgroups in infinite-dimensional classical groups G (usually they are not symmetric and their finite-dimensional analogs are not spherical). We present a structure of a semigroup on double cosets L\setminus G/L for various subgroups L in G, moreover these semigroups act in spaces of L-fixed vectors in unitary representations of G. We also obtain semigroup envelops of groups G generalizing constructions of operator colligations.
