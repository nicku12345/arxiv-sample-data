Let G be a semisimple Lie group and let \g =\n_- +\hh +\n be a triangular decomposition of \g= \hbox{Lie}\,G. Let \b =\hh +\n and let H,N,B be Lie subgroups of G corresponding respectively to \hh,\n and \b. We may identify \n_- with the dual space to \n. The coadjoint action of N on \n_- extends to an action of B on \n_-. There exists a unique nonempty Zariski open orbit X of B on \n_-. Any N-orbit in X is a maximal coadjoint orbit of N in \n_-. The cascade of orthogonal roots defines a cross-section \r_-^{\times} of the set of such orbits leading to a decomposition X = N/R\times \r_-^{\times}. This decomposition, among other things, establishes the structure of S(\n)^{\n} as a polynomial ring generated by the prime polynomials of H-weight vectors in S(\n)^{\n}. It also leads tothe multiplicity 1 of H weights in S(\n)^{\n}.
