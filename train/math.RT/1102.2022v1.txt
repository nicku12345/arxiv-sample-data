We study the right regular representation on the space L^2(N_0\setminus G;\psi) where G is a quasi-split p-adic group and \psi a non-degenerate unitary character of the unipotent subgroup N_0 of a minimal parabolic subgroup of G. We obtain the direct integral decomposition of this space into its constituent representations. In particular, we deduce that the discrete spectrum of L^2(N_0\setminus G;\psi) consists precisely of \psi generic discrete series representations and derive the Plancherel formula for L^2(N_0\setminus G;\psi).
