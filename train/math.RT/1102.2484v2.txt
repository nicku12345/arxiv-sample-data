In this article, we consider indecomposable Specht modules with abelian vertices. We show that the corresponding partitions are necessarily p^2-cores where p is the characteristic of the underlying field. Furthermore, in the case of p\geq 3, or p=2 and \mu is 2-regular, we show that the complexity of the Specht module S^\mu is precisely the p-weight of the partition \mu. In the latter case, we classify Specht modules with abelian vertices. For some applications of the above results, we extend a result of M. Wildon and compute the vertices of the Specht module S^{(p^p)} for p\geq 3.
