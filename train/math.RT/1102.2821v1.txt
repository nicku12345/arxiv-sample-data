In this paper we study the derived category of sheaves on the affine Grassmannian of a complex reductive group G, contructible with respect to the stratification by G(C[[x]])-orbits. Following ideas of Ginzburg and Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov-Ginzburg, we describe this category (and a mixed version) in terms of coherent sheaves on the nilpotent cone of its Langlands dual reductive group. We also show, in the mixed case, that restriction to the nilpotent cone of a Levi subgroup corresponds to hyperbolic localization on affine Grassmannians.
