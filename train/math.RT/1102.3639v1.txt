Let \zeta be a complex \ellth root of unity for an odd integer \ell>1. For any complex simple Lie algebra \mathfrak g, let u_\zeta=u_\zeta({\mathfrak g}) be the associated "small" quantum enveloping algebra. In general, little is known about the representation theory of quantum groups (resp., algebraic groups) when l (resp., p) is smaller than the Coxeter number h of the underlying root system. For example, Lusztig's conjecture concerning the characters of the rational irreducible G-modules stipulates that p \geq h. The main result in this paper provides a surprisingly uniform answer for the cohomology algebra \opH^\bullet(u_\zeta,{\mathbb C}) of the small quantum group. When \ell>h, this cohomology algebra has been calculated by Ginzburg and Kumar \cite{GK}. Our result requires powerful tools from complex geometry and a detailed knowledge of the geometry of the nullcone of \mathfrak g. In this way, the methods point out difficulties present in obtaining similar results for the restricted enveloping algebra u in small characteristics, though they do provide some clarification of known results there also. Finally, we establish that if M is a finite dimensional u_\zeta-module, then \opH^\bullet(u_\zeta,M) is a finitely generated \opH^\bullet(u_\zeta,\mathbb C)-module, and we obtain new results on the theory of support varieties for u_\zeta.
