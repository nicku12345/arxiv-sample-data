We provide formulas for the denominator and superdenominator of a basic classical type Lie superalgebra for any set of positive roots. We establish a connection between certain sets of positive roots and the theory of reductive dual pairs of real Lie groups. As an application of our formulas, we recover the Theta correspondence for compact dual pairs. Along the way we give an explicit description of the real forms of basic classical type Lie superalgebras.
