Let \mathcal{N}_{\mathfrak{g}^*} be the variety of nilpotent elements in the dual of the Lie algebra of a reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field. In \cite{Lu2} Lusztig proposes a definition of a partition of \mathcal{N}_{\mathfrak{g}^*} into smooth locally closed subvarieties (which are indexed by the unipotent classes in the corresponding group over complex numbers) and gives explicit results in types A, C and D. We discuss type B in this note.
