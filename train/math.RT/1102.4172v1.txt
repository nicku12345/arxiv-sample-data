The Kazhdan-Lusztig parameters are important parameters in the representation theory of p-adic groups and affine Hecke algebras. We show that the Kazhdan-Lusztig parameters have a definite geometric structure, namely that of the extended quotient T//W of a complex torus T by a finite Weyl group W. More generally, we show that the corresponding parameters, in the principal series of a reductive p-adic group with connected centre, admit such a geometric structure. This confirms, in a special case, our recently formulated geometric conjecture. In the course of this study, we provide a unified framework for Kazhdan-Lusztig parameters on the one hand, and Springer parameters on the other hand. Our framework contains a complex parameter s, and allows us to interpolate between s = 1 and s = \sqrt q. When s = 1, we recover the parameters which occur in the Springer correspondence; when s = \sqrt q, we recover the Kazhdan-Lusztig parameters.
