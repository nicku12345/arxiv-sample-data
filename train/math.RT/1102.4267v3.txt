We determine the numerical invariants of blocks with defect group D_{2^n}\times C_{2^m}, where D_{2^n} denotes a dihedral group of order 2^n and C_{2^m} denotes a cyclic group of order 2^m. This generalizes Brauer's results for m=0. As a consequence, we prove Brauer's k(B)-conjecture, Olsson's conjecture (and more generally Eaton's conjecture), Brauer's height zero conjecture, the Alperin-McKay conjecture, Alperin's weight conjecture and Robinson's ordinary weight conjecture for these blocks. Moreover, we show that the gluing problem has a unique solution in this case.
