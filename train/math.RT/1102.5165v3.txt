We construct and investigate the structure of the Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras R and their cyclotomic quotients R^\lambda which give a categrification of quantum generalized Kac-Moody algebras. Let U_\A(\g) be the integral form of the quantum generalized Kac-Moody algebra associated with a Borcherds-Cartan matrix A=(a_{ij})_{i,j \in I} and let K_0(R) be the Grothedieck group of finitely generated projective graded R-modules. We prove that there exists an injective algebra homomorphism \Phi: U_\A^-(\g) \to K_0(R) and that \Phi is an isomorphism if a_{ii}\ne 0 for all i\in I. Let B(\infty) and B(\lambda) be the crystals of U_q^-(\g) and V(\lambda), respectively, where V(\lambda) is the irreducible highest weight U_q(\g)-module. We denote by \mathfrak{B}(\infty) and \mathfrak{B}(\lambda) the isomorphism classes of irreducible graded modules over R and R^\lambda, respectively. If a_{ii}\ne 0 for all i\in I, we define the U_q(\g)-crystal structures on \mathfrak{B}(\infty) and \mathfrak{B}(\lambda), and show that there exist crystal isomorphisms \mathfrak{B}(\infty) \simeq B(\infty) and \mathfrak{B}(\lambda) \simeq B(\lambda). One of the key ingredients of our approach is the perfect basis theory for generalized Kac-Moody algebras.
