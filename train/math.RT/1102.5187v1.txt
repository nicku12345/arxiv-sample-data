Intrigued by a well-known theorem of Mathieu's on Harish-Chandra modules over the Virasoro algebra, we give an analogous result for a class of Block type Lie algebras \BB, where the parameter q is a nonzero complex number. We also classify quasifinite irreducible highest weight \BB-modules and irreducible \BB-modules of the intermediate series. In particular, we obtain that an irreducible \BB-module of the intermediate series may be a nontrivial extension of a \Vir-module of the intermediate series if q is half of a negative integer, where \Vir is a subalgebra of \BB isomorphic to the Virasoro algebra.
