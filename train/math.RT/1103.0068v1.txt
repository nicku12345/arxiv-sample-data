This paper will prove that: 1. G has a block only having linear ordinary characters if and only if G is a p-nilpotent group with an abelian Sylow p-subgroup; 2. G has a block only having linear Brauer characters if and only if O_{p'}(G)\leq O_{p'p}(G)=HO_{p'}(G)= \textrm{Ker}(B_{0}^{*}) \leq O_{p'pp'}=G, where H=G^{'}O^{p'}(G), \textrm{Ker}(B_{0}^{*})=\bigcap_{\lambda \in \textrm{IBr}(B_{0})} \textrm{Ker}(V_{\lambda}), B_{0} is the principal block of G and V_{\lambda} is the F[G]-module affording the Brauer character \lambda; 3. if G satisfies the conditions above, then for any block algebra B of G, we have  \frac{\textrm{Dim}_{F}(B)}{|D|}= \sum_{\phi \in \textrm{IBr}(B)}\phi(1)^{2} where D is the defect group of B.
