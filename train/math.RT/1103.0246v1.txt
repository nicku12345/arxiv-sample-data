Let F be a field of characteristic p. We show that \Hom_{F\Sigma_n}(S^\lambda, S^\mu) can have arbitrarily large dimension as n and p grow, where S^\lambda and S^\mu are Specht modules for the symmetric group \Sigma_n. Similar results hold for the Weyl modules of the general linear group. Every previously computed example has been at most one-dimensional, with the exception of Specht modules over a field of characteristic two. The proof uses the work of Chuang and Tan, providing detailed information about the radical series of Weyl modules in Rouquier blocks.
