Deligne has defined a category which interpolates among the representations of the various symmetric groups. In this paper we show Deligne's category admits a unique nontrivial family of modified trace functions. Such modified trace functions have already proven to be interesting in both low-dimensional topology and representation theory. We also introduce a graded variant of Deligne's category, lift the modified trace functions to the graded setting, and use them to recover the well-known invariant of framed knots known as the writhe.
