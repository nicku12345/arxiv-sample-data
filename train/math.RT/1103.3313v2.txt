Francois Rodier proved that it is possible to view smooth representations of certain totally disconnected abelian groups (the underlying additive group of a finite-dimensional p-adic vector space, for example) as sheaves on the Pontryagin dual group. For nonabelian totally disconnected groups, the appropriate dual space necessarily includes representations which are not one-dimensional, and does not carry a group structure. The general definition of the topology on the dual space is technically unwieldy, so we provide three different characterizations of this topology for a large class of totally disconnected groups (which includes, for example, p-adic unipotent groups), each with a somewhat different flavor. We then use these results to demonstrate some formal similarities between smooth representations and sheaves on the dual space, including a concrete description of the Bernstein center of the category of smooth representations.
