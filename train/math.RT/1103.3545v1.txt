Let \g be a finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra and \b a Borel subalgebra. Then \g acts on its exterior algebra \w\g naturally.   We prove that the maximal eigenvalue of the Casimir operator on \w\g is one third of the dimension of \g, that the maximal eigenvalue m_i of the Casimir operator on \w^i\g is increasing for 0\le i\le r, where r is the number of positive roots, and that the corresponding eigenspace M_i is a multiplicity-free \g-module whose highest weight vectors corresponding to certain ad-nilpotent ideals of \b. We also obtain a result describing the set of weights of the irreducible representation of \g with highest weight a multiple of \rho, where \rho is one half the sum of positive roots.
