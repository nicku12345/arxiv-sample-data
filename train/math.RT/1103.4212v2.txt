Based on Garland's work, in this paper we construct the Eisenstein series on the adelic loop groups over a number field, induced from either a cusp form or a quasi-character which is assumed to be unramified. We compute the constant terms, prove their absolute and uniform convergence under the affine analog of Godement's criterion. For the case of quasi-characters the resulting formula is an affine Gindikin-Karpelevich formula. Then we prove the convergence of Eisenstein series themselves in certain analogs of Siegel subsets.
