In this article we connect topics from convex and integral geometry with well known topics in representation theory of semisimple Lie groups by showing that the Cos^\lamda and Sin^\lambda-transforms on the Grassmann manifolds Gr_p(K)=SU (n+1,K)/S (U (p,K)\times U (n+1-p,K)) are standard intertwining operators between certain generalized principal series representations induced from a maximal parabolic subgroup P_p of SL (n+1,K). The index {}_p indicates the dependence of the parabolic on p. The general results of Knapp and Stein and Vogan and Wallach then show that both transforms have meromorphic extension to C and are invertible for generic \lambda\in C. Furthermore, known methods from representation theory combined with a Selberg type integral allow us to determine the K-spectrum of those operators.
