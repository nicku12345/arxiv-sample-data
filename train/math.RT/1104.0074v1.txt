Given a measure \bar\mu on a locally symmetric space Y=\Gamma\backslash G/K, obtained as a weak-{*} limit of probability measures associated to eigenfunctions of the ring of invariant differential operators, we construct a measure \mu on the homogeneous space X=\Gamma\backslash G which lifts \bar\mu and which is invariant by a connected subgroup A_{1}\subset A of positive dimension, where G=NAK is an Iwasawa decomposition. If the functions are, in addition, eigenfunctions of the Hecke operators, then \mu is also the limit of measures associated to Hecke eigenfunctions on X. This generalizes previous results of the author and A.\ Venkatesh to the case of "degenerate" limiting spectral parameters.
