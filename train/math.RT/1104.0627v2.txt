We show that every two-term tilting complex over an Artin algebra has a tilting module over a certain factor algebra as a homology group. Also, we determine the endomorphism algebra of such a homology group, which is given as a certain factor algebra of the endomorphism algebra of the two-term tilting complex. Thus, every derived equivalence between Artin algebras given by a two-term tilting complex induces a derived equivalence between the corresponding factor algebras.
