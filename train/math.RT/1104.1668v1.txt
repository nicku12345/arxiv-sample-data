Let \fg be the Lie superalgebra \fgl(m,n). Algorithms for computing the composition factors and multiplicities of Kac modules for \fg were given by the second author in 1996, and by J. Brundan in 2003.   We give a combinatorial proof of the equivalence between the two algorithms. The proof uses weight and cap diagrams introduced by Brundan and C. Stroppel, and cancelations between paths in a graph \mathcal{G} defined using these diagrams. Each vertex of \mathcal{G} corresponds to a highest weight of a finite dimensional simple module, and each edge is weighted by a nonnegative integer. If \mathcal{E} is the subgraph of \mathcal{G} obtained by deleting all edges of positive weight, then \mathcal{E} is the graph that describes non-split extensions between simple highest weight modules.   We also give a procedure for finding the composition factors of any Kac module, without cancelation. This procedure leads to a second proof of the main result.
