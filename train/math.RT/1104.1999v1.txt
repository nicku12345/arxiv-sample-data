In earlier work, Barchini, Kable, and Zierau constructed a number of conformally invariant systems of differential operators associated to Heisenberg parabolic subalgebras in simple Lie algebras. The construction was systematic, but the existence of such a system was left open in two cases, namely, the \Omega_3 system for type A_2 and type D_4. Here, such a system is shown to exist for both cases. The construction of the system may also be interpreted as giving an explicit homomorphism between generalized Verma modules.
