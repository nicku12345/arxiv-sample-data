For each pair of complex symmetric matrices (A,B) we provide a normal form with a minimal number of independent parameters, to which all pairs of complex symmetric matrices (\widetilde{A},\widetilde{B}), close to (A,B) can be reduced by congruence transformation that smoothly depends on the entries of \widetilde{A} and \widetilde{B}. Such a normal form is called a miniversal deformation of (A,B) under congruence. A number of independent parameters in the miniversal deformation of a symmetric matrix pencil is equal to the codimension of the congruence orbit of this symmetric matrix pencil and is computed too. We also provide an upper bound on the distance from (A,B) to its miniversal deformation.
