The most singular residues of the standard meromorphic family of trilinear conformally invariant forms on \mathcal C^\infty_c(\mathbb R^d) are computed. Their expression involves covariant bidifferential operators (generalized Rankin Cohen operators), for which new formul\ae \ are obtained. The main tool is a Bernstein-Sato identity for the kernel of the forms.
