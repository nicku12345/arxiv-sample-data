We give a classification of the triples (g,g',q) such that Zuckerman's derived functor (g,K)-module A_q(\lambda) for a \theta-stable parabolic subalgebra q is discretely decomposable with respect to a reductive symmetric pair (g,g'). The proof is based on the criterion for discretely decomposable restrictions by the first author and on Berger's classification of reductive symmetric pairs.
