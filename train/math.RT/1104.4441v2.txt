Motivated by the structure of the algebras associated to the blocks of the BGG-category O we define a subclass of quasi-hereditary algebras called 1-quasi-hereditary. Many properties of these algebras only depend on the defining partial order. In particular, we can determine the quiver and the form of the relations. Moreover, if the Ringel dual of a 1-quasi-hereditary algebra is also 1-quasi-hereditary, then the structure of the characteristic tilting module can be computed.
