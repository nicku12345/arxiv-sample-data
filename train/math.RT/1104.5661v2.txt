Let M be a flat manifold. We say that M has R_\infty property if the Reidemeister number R(f) = \infty for every homeomorphism f \colon M \to M. In this paper, we investigate a relation between the holonomy representation \rho of a flat manifold M and the R_\infty property. In case when the holonomy group of M is solvable we show that, if \rho has a unique \mathbb{R}-irreducible subrepresentation of odd degree, then M has R_\infty property. The result is related to conjecture 4.8 from [1].   [1] K. Dekimpe, B. De Rock, P. Penninckx, \emph{The R_{\infty} property for infra-nilmanifolds}, Topol.
