For two different natural definitions of Casimir operators for simple Lie algebras we show that their eigenvalues in the adjoint representation can be expressed polynomially in the universal Vogel's parameters \alpha, \beta, \gamma and give explicit formulae for the generating functions of these eigenvalues.
