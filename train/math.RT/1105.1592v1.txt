In this article, we give a simple explicit construction of an affine slice for the coadjoint action of a certain class of biparabolic (also called seaweed) subalgebras of a semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. In particular, this class includes all Borel subalgebras.
