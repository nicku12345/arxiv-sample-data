A diagram obtained from the Carter diagram \Gamma by adding one root together with its bonds such that the resulting subset of roots is linearly independent is said to be the {\it linkage diagram}. Given a linkage diagram, we associate the linkage labels vector, which is introduced like the vector of Dynkin labels. Similarly to the dual Weyl group, we introduce the group W^{\vee}_L associated with \Gamma, and we call it the dual partial Weyl group. The linkage labels vectors connected under the action of W^{\vee}_L constitute the linkage system \mathscr{L}(\Gamma), which is similar to the weight system arising in the representation theory of the semisimple Lie algebras. The Carter theorem states that every element of a Weyl group W is expressible as the product of two involutions. We give the proof of this theorem based on the description of the linkage system \mathscr{L}(\Gamma) and semi-Coxeter orbits of linkage labels vectors for any Carter diagram \Gamma. The main idea of the proof is based on the fact that, with a few exceptions, in each semi-Coxeter orbit there is a special linkage diagram -- called {\it unicolored}, for which the decomposition into the product of two involutions is trivial.
