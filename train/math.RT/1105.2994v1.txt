Let A be a finite dimensional hereditary algebra over a field k and A^{(1)} the duplicated algebra of A. We first show that the global dimension of endomorphism ring of tilting modules of A^{(1)} is at most 3. Then we investigate embedding tilting quiver \mathscr{K}(A) of A into tilting quiver \mathscr{K}(A^{(1)}) of A^{(1)}. As applications, we give new proofs for some results of D.Happel and L.Unger, and prove that every connected component in \mathscr{K}({A}) has finite non-saturated points if A is tame type, which gives a partially positive answer to the conjecture of D.Happel and L.Unger in [10]. Finally, we also prove that the number of arrows in \mathscr{K}({A}) is a constant which does not depend on the orientation of Q if Q is Dynkin type.
