We find for each simple finitary Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} a category \mathbb{T}_\mathfrak{g} of integrable modules in which the tensor product of copies of the natural and conatural modules are injective. The objects in \mathbb{T}_\mathfrak{g} can be defined as the finite length absolute weight modules, where by absolute weight module we mean a module which is a weight module for every splitting Cartan subalgebra of \mathfrak{g}. The category \mathbb{T}_\mathfrak{g} is Koszul in the sense that it is antiequivalent to the category of locally unitary finite-dimensional modules over a certain direct limit of finite-dimensional Koszul algebras. We describe these finite-dimensional algebras explicitly. We also prove an equivalence of the categories \mathbb{T}_{o(\infty)} and \mathbb{T}_{sp(\infty)} corresponding respectively to the orthogonal and symplectic finitary Lie algebras o(\infty), sp(\infty).
