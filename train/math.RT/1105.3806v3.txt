Let \Omega=G/K be a bounded symmetric domain and S=K/L its Shilov boundary. We consider the action of G on sections of a homogeneous line bundle over \Omega and the corresponding eigenspaces of G-invariant differential operators. The Poisson transform maps hyperfunctions on the S to the eigenspaces. We characterize the image in terms of twisted Hua operators. For some special parameters the Poisson transform is of Szeg\"o type mapping into the relative discrete series; we compute the corresponding elements in the discrete series.
