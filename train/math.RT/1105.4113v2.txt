For a Weyl group W, we give a simple closed formula (valid on elliptic conjugacy classes) for the character of the representation of W in each A-isotypic component of the full homology of a Springer fiber. We also give a formula (valid again on elliptic conjugacy classes) of the W-character of an irreducible discrete series representation with real central character of a graded affine Hecke algebra with arbitrary parameters. In both cases, the Pin double cover of W and the Dirac operator for graded affine Hecke algebras play key roles.
