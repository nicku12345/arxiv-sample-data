We obtain a closed formula for the v-decomposition numbers d_{\lambda\mu}(v) arising from the canonical basis of the Fock space representation of U_v(\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}_e), where the partition \lambda is obtained from \mu by moving some nodes in its Young diagram, all of which having the same e-residue. We also show that when these v-decomposition numbers are evaluated at v=1, we obtain the corresponding decomposition numbers for the Schur algebras and symmetric groups.
