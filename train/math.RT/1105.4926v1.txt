In this paper we extend a result for representations of the Additive group G_a given in [3] to the Heisenberg group H_1. Namely, if p is greater than 2d then all d-dimensional characteristic p representations for H_1 can be factored into commuting products of representations, with each factor arising from a representation of the Lie algebra of H_1, one for each of the the representation's Frobenius layers. In this sense, for a fixed dimension and large enough p, all representations for H_1 look generically like representations for direct powers of it over a field of characteristic zero.   The reader may consult chapter 13 of [1] for a fuller account of what follows.
