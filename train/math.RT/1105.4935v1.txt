It is generally believed (and for the most part is probably true) that Lie theory, in contrast to the characteristic zero case, is insufficient to tackle the representation theory of algebraic groups over prime characteristic fields. However, in this paper we show that, for a large and important class of unipotent algebraic groups (namely the unipotent upper triangular groups U_n), and under a certain hypothesis relating the characteristic p to both n and the dimension d of a representation (specifically, p \geq \text{max}(n,2d)), Lie theory is completely sufficient to determine the representation theory of these groups. To finish, we mention some important analogies (both functorial and cohomological) between the characteristic zero theories of these groups and their `generic' representation theory in characteristic p.
