Let H be the fixed point group of a rational involution \si of a reductive p-adic group of charactersistic different from 2(this new version allows to remove the hypothesis on the characteristic of the residue field, see Proposition 2.3 and section 10). Let P be a \si-parabolic subgroup of G  i.e. such that \si(P) is opposite to P. We denote by M the intersection with \si(P). Kato and Takano on one hand, Lagier on the other hand associated canonically to an H-form, i.e. an H-fixed linear form, \xi, on a smooth admissible G-module, V, a linear form on the Jacquet module j_P(V) of V along P which is fixed by M\cap H. We call this operation constant term of H-fixed linear forms. This constant term is linked to the asymptotic behaviour of the generalized coefficients with respect to \xi.   P. Blanc and the second author defined a family of H-fixed linear forms on certain parabolically induced representations, associated to an M\cap H-fixed linear form, \eta, on the space of the inducing representation.   The purpose of this article is to describe the constant term of these H-fixed linear forms. Also it is shown that when \eta is square integrable, i.e. when the generalized coefficients of \eta are square integrable, the corresponding family of H-fixed linear forms on the induced representations is a family of tempered, in a suitable sense, of H-fixed linear forms.
