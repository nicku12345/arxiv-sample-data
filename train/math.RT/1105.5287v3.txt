Let K be an arbitrary field of characteristic not equal to 2. Let m, n\in\N and V an m dimensional orthogonal space over K. There is a right action of the Brauer algebra \bb_n(m) on the n-tensor space V^{\otimes n} which centralizes the left action of the orthogonal group O(V). Recently G.I. Lehrer and R.B. Zhang defined certain quasi-idempotents E_i in \bb_n(m) (see (\ref{keydfn})) and proved that the annihilator of V^{\otimes n} in \bb_n(m) is always equal to the two-sided ideal generated by E_{[(m+1)/2]} if \ch K=0 or \ch K>2(m+1). In this paper we extend this theorem to arbitrary field K with \ch K\neq 2 as conjectured by Lehrer and Zhang. As a byproduct, we discover a combinatorial identity which relates to the dimensions of Specht modules over symmetric groups of different sizes and a new integral basis for the annihilator of V^{\otimes m+1} in \bb_{m+1}(m).
