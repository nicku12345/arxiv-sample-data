We study the category \cal I_{\gr} of graded representations with finite--dimensional graded pieces for the current algebra \lie g\otimes\bc[t] where \lie g is a simple Lie algebra. This category has many similarities with the category \cal O of modules for \lie g and in this paper, we formulate and study an analogue of the famous BGG duality. We recall the definition of the projective and simple objects in \cal I_{\gr} which are indexed by dominant integral weights. The role of the Verma modules is played by a family of modules called the global Weyl modules. We show that in the case when \lie g is of type \lie{sl}_2, the projective module admits a flag in which the successive quotients are finite direct sums of global Weyl modules. The multiplicity with which a particular Weyl module occurs in the flag is determined by the multiplicity of a Jordan--Holder series for a closely associated family of modules, called the local Weyl modules. We conjecture that the result remains true for arbitrary simple Lie algebras. We also prove some combinatorial product--sum identities involving Kostka polynomials which arise as a consequence of our theorem.
