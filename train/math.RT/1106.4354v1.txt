We construct two families of refinements of the (projectivized) support variety of a finite dimensional module M for a finite group scheme G. For an arbitrary finite group scheme, we associate a family of {\it non maximal rank varieties} \Gamma^j(G)_M, 1\leq j \leq p-1, to a kG-module M. For G infinitesimal, we construct a finer family of locally closed subvarieties V^{\ul a}(G)_M of the variety of one parameter subgroups of G for any partition \ul a of \dim M. For an arbitrary finite group scheme G, a kG-module M of constant rank, and a cohomology class \zeta in \HHH^1(G,M) we introduce the {\it zero locus} Z(\zeta) \subset \Pi(G). We show that Z(\zeta) is a closed subvariety, and relate it to the non-maximal rank varieties. We also extend the construction of Z(\zeta) to an arbitrary extension class \zeta \in \Ext^n_G(M,N) whenever M and N are kG-modules of constant Jordan type.
