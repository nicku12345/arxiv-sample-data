We initiate the study of representations of elementary abelian p-groups via restrictions to truncated polynomial subalgebras of the group algebra generated by r nilpotent elements, k[t_1,..., t_r]/(t^p_1,..., t_r^p). We introduce new geometric invariants based on the behavior of modules upon restrictions to such subalgebras. We also introduce modules of constant radical and socle type generalizing modules of constant Jordan type and provide several general constructions of modules with these properties. We show that modules of constant radical and socle type lead to families of algebraic vector bundles on Grassmannians and illustrate our theory with numerous examples.
