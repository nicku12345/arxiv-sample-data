Let G be a finite group of Lie type and \ell be a prime which is not equal to the defining characteristic of G. In this note we discuss some open problems concerning the \ell-modular irreducible representations of G. We also establish a strengthening of the results in [13] on the classification of the \ell-modular principal series representations of G.
