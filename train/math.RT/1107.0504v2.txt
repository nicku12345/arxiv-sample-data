We study rational Cherednik algebras over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. We first prove several general results about category O, and then focus on rational Cherednik algebras associated to the general and special linear group over a finite field of the same characteristic as the underlying algebraically closed field. For such algebras we calculate the characters of irreducible representations with trivial lowest weight.
