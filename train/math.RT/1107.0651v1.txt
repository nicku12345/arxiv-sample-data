Let G_o be a semisimple Lie group, let K_o be a maximal compact subgroup of G_o and let \mathfrak{k}\subset\mathfrak{g} denote the complexification of their Lie algebras. Let G be the adjoint group of \mathfrak{g} and let K be the connected Lie subgroup of G with Lie algebra ad(\mathfrak{k}). If U(\mathfrak{g}) is the universal enveloping algebra of \mathfrak{g} then U(\mathfrak{g})^K will denote the centralizer of K in U(\mathfrak{g}). Also let P:U(\mathfrak{g})\longrightarrow U(\mathfrak{k})\otimes U(\mathfrak{a}) be the projection map corresponding to the direct sum U(\mathfrak{g})=\bigl(U(\mathfrak{k})\otimes U(\mathfrak{a})\bigr)\oplus U(\mathfrak{g})\mathfrak{n} associated to an Iwasawa decomposition of G_o adapted to K_o. In this paper we give a characterization of the image of U(\mathfrak{g})^K under the injective antihomorphism P:U(\mathfrak{g})^K\longrightarrow U(\mathfrak{k})^M\otimes U(\mathfrak{a}), considered by Lepowsky, when G_o is locally isomorphic to F_4.
