We establish some results in local harmonic analysis which are necessary for Arthur's invariant trace formula for coverings of connected reductive groups. More precisely, for local coverings we will study (1) the Plancherel formula and its preparations, (2) the normalization of intertwining operators subject to Arthur's conditions, (3) the local behavior of characters of admissible representations in the nonarchimedean case, and (4) the genuine part of the invariant local trace formula. As a byproduct of the invariant local trace formula, we deduce the density of tempered characters for coverings.
