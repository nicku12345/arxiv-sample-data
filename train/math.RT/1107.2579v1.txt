Let \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}_{\bar{0}}\oplus \mathfrak{g}_{\bar{1}} be a classical Lie superalgebra and \mathcal{F} be the category of finite dimensional \mathfrak{g}-supermodules which are completely reducible over the reductive Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}_{\bar{0}}. In an earlier paper the authors demonstrated that for any module M in \mathcal{F} the rate of growth of the minimal projective resolution (i.e., the complexity of M) is bounded by the dimension of \mathfrak{g}_{\bar{1}}. In this paper we compute the complexity of the simple modules and the Kac modules for the Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{gl}(m|n). In both cases we show that the complexity is related to the atypicality of the block containing the module.
