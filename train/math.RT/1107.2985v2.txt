In this paper, we consider n-perforated Yoneda algebras for n-angulated categories, and show that, under some conditions, n-angles induce derived equivalences between the quotient algebras of n-perforated Yoneda algebras. This result generalizes some results of Hu, K\"{o}nig and Xi. And it also establishes a connection between higher cluster theory and derived equivalences. Namely, in a cluster tilting subcategory of a triangulated category, an Auslander-Reiten n-angle implies a derived equivalence between two quotient algebras. This result can be compared with the fact that an Auslander-Reiten sequence suggests a derived equivalence between two algebras which was proved by Hu and Xi.
