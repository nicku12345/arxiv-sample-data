Let A be a finite dimensional hereditary algebra over an algebraically closed field k, T_2(A)=(\begin{array}{cc}A&0 A&A\end{array}) be the triangular matrix algebra and A^{(1)}=(\begin{array}{cc}A&0 DA&A\end{array}) be the duplicated algebra of A respectively. We prove that {\rm rep.dim}\ T_2(A) is at most three if A is Dynkin type and {\rm rep.dim}\ T_2(A) is at most four if A is not Dynkin type. Let T be a tilting A-\module and \ol{T}=T\oplus\ol{P} be a tilting A^{(1)}-\module. We show that \End_{A^{(1)}} \ol{T} is representation finite if and only if the full subcategory \{(X,Y,f)\ |\ X\in {\rm mod}\ A, Y\in\tau^{-1}\mathscr{F}(T_A)\cup{\rm add}\ A\} of {\rm mod \ T_2(A)} is of finite type, where \tau is the Auslander-Reiten translation and \mathscr{F}(T_A) is the torsion-free class of {\rm mod}\ A associated with T. Moreover, we also prove that {\rm rep.dim\ End}_{A^{(1)}}\ {\ol T} is at most three if A is Dynkin type.
