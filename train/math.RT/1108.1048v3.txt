We give an explicit construction of irreducible modules over Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras R and their cyclotomic quotients R^{\lambda} for finite classical types using a crystal basis theoretic approach. More precisely, for each element v of the crystal B(\infty) (resp. B(\lambda)), we first construct certain modules \nabla(\mathbf{a};k) labeled by the adapted string \mathbf{a} of v. We then prove that the head of the induced module \ind \big(\nabla(\mathbf{a};1) \boxtimes...\boxtimes \nabla(\mathbf{a};n)\big) is irreducible and that every irreducible R-module (resp. R^{\lambda}-module) can be realized as the irreducible head of one of the induced modules \ind (\nabla(\mathbf{a};1) \boxtimes...\boxtimes \nabla(\mathbf{a};n)). Moreover, we show that our construction is compatible with the crystal structure on B(\infty) (resp. B(\lambda)).
