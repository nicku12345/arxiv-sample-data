We introduce a class of non-commutative algebras that carry a non-commutative (geometric) cluster structure which are generated by identical copies of generalized Weyl algebras. Equivalent conditions for the finiteness of the set of the cluster variables of these cluster structures are provided. Some combinatorial data, called \textit{cluster strands,} arising from the cluster structure are used to construct irreducible representations of generalized Weyl algebras.
