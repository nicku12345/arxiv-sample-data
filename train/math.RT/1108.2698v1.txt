This paper builds on earlier work, where the authors described Whittaker modules for the Virasoro algebra. Using a framework of Batra and Mazorchuk, the current paper investigates a category of Virasoro algebra modules that includes Whittaker modules. Results in this paper include a classification of the simple modules in the category and a description of certain induced modules that are a natural generalization of simple Whittaker modules.
