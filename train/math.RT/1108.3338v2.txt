For p odd, the Lie group SO_0(p+1,p+1) has a family of unitary degenerate principal series representations realized on the space of real (p+1) by (p+1) skew symmetric matrices, similar to the Stein's complementary series for SL(2n,C) or Speh's representation for SL(2n,R). We consider their restriction on the subgroup G= SO(p+1,p) and prove that they are still irreducible and is equivalent to (a unitarization of) the principal series representation of G, and also irreducible under a maximal parabolic subgroup of G.
