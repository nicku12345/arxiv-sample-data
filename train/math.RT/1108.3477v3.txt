We find upper and lower bounds of the multiplicities of irreducible admissible representations \pi of a semisimple Lie group G occurring in the induced representations Ind_H^G\tau from irreducible representations \tau of a closed subgroup H.   As corollaries, we establish geometric criteria for finiteness of the dimension of Hom_G(\pi,Ind_H^G \tau) (induction) and of Hom_H(\pi|_H,\tau) (restriction) by means of the real flag variety G/P, and discover that uniform boundedness property of these multiplicities is independent of real forms and characterized by means of the complex flag variety.
