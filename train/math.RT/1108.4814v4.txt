Let G be a simple algebraic group defined over a finite field of good characteristic, with associated Frobenius endomorphism F. In this article we extend an observation of Lusztig, (which gives a numerical relationship between an ordinary character of G^F and its unipotent support), to the case where Z(G) is disconnected. We then use this observation in some applications to the ordinary character theory of G^F.
