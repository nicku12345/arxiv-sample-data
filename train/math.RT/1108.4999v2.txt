For a simply-connected simple algebraic group G over \C, we exhibit a subvariety of its affine Grassmannian that is closely related to the nilpotent cone of G, generalizing a well-known fact about GL_n. Using this variety, we construct a sheaf-theoretic functor that, when combined with the geometric Satake equivalence and the Springer correspondence, leads to a geometric explanation for a number of known facts (mostly due to Broer and Reeder) about small representations of the dual group.
