We apply the super duality formalism recently developed by the authors to obtain new equivalences of various module categories of general linear Lie superalgebras. We establish the correspondence of standard, tilting, and simple modules, as well as the identification of the u-homology groups, under these category equivalences. As an application, we obtain a complete solution of the irreducible character problem for some new parabolic BGG categories of gl(m|n)-modules, including the full BGG category of gl(m|2)-modules, in terms of type A Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.
