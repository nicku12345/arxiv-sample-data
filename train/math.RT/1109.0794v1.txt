Let k be a field, \tilde{G} a connected reductive k-quasisplit group, \Gamma a finite group that acts on \tilde{G} via k-automorphisms satisfying a quasi-semisimplicity condition, and G the connected part of the group of \Gamma-fixed points of \tilde{G}, also assumed k-quasisplit. In an earlier work, the authors constructed a canonical map \hat{\mathcal{N}} from the set of stable semisimple conjugacy classes in the dual G^*(k) to the set of such classes in \tilde{G}^*(k). We describe several situations where \hat{\mathcal{N}} can be refined to an explicit function on points, or where it factors through such a function.
