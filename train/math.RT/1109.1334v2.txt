The structure of Terwilliger algebras of wreath products by thin schemes or one-class schemes was studied in [A. Hanaki, K. Kim, Y. Maekawa, Terwilliger algebras of direct and wreath products of association schemes, J. Algebra 343 (2011) 195--200]. In this paper, we will consider the structure of Terwilliger algebras of wreath products by quasi-thin schemes. This gives a generalization of their result.
