Let A be a Poisson algebra and \Q(A) its quasi-Poisson enveloping algebra. In this paper, the Yoneda-Ext algebra \Ext^*_{\Q(A)}(A, A), which we call the quasi-Poisson cohomology algebra of A, is investigated. We construct a projective resolution of A as \Q(A)-modules, which enables to compute the quasi-Poisson cohomologies in a standard way. To simplify calculation, we also introduce the quasi-Poisson complex and apply to obtain quasi-Poisson cohomologies in some special cases.
