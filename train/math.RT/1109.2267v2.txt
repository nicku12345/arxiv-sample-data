In this paper we determine the second Hochschild cohomology group for a class of self-injective algebras of tame representation type namely, those which are standard one-parametric but not weakly symmetric. These were classifed up to derived equivalence by Bocian, Holm and Skowro\'nski. We connect this to the deformation of these algebras.
