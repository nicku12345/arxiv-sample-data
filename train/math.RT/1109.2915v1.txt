We show that a tilted algebra A is tame if and only if for each generic root \dd of A and each indecomposable irreducible component C of \module(A,\dd), the field of rational invariants k(C)^{\GL(\dd)} is isomorphic to k or k(x). Next, we show that the tame tilted algebras are precisely those tilted algebras A with the property that for each generic root \dd of A and each indecomposable irreducible component C \subseteq \module(A,\dd), the moduli space \M(C)^{ss}_{\theta} is either a point or just \mathbb P^1 whenever \theta is an integral weight for which C^s_{\theta}\neq \emptyset. We furthermore show that the tameness of a tilted algebra is equivalent to the moduli space \M(C)^{ss}_{\theta} being smooth for each generic root \dd of A, each indecomposable irreducible component C \subseteq \module(A,\dd), and each integral weight \theta for which C^s_{\theta} \neq \emptyset. As a consequence of this latter description, we show that the smoothness of the various moduli spaces of modules for a strongly simply connected algebra A implies the tameness of A.   Along the way, we explain how moduli spaces of modules for finite-dimensional algebras behave with respect to tilting functors, and to theta-stable decompositions.
