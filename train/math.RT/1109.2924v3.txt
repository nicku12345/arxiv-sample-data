We study the oriented exchange graph \textrm{EG}^\circ(\Gamma_{N}\,Q) of reachable hearts in the finite-dimensional derived category \mathcal{D}(\Gamma_{N}\,Q) of the CY-N Ginzburg algebra \Gamma_{N}Q associated to an acyclic quiver Q. We show that any such heart is induced from some heart in the bounded derived category \mathcal{D}(Q) via some `Lagrangian immersion' \mathcal{L}:\mathcal{D}(Q)\to\mathcal{D}(\Gamma_{N}\,Q). We build on this to show that the quotient of \textrm{EG}^\circ(\Gamma_{N}\,Q) by the Seidel-Thomas braid group is the exchange graph \textrm{CEG}_{N-1}(Q) of cluster tilting sets in the (higher) cluster category \mathcal{C}_{N-1}(Q). As an application, we interpret Buan-Thomas' coloured quiver for a cluster tilting set in terms of the Ext quiver of any corresponding heart in \mathcal{D}(\Gamma_{N}\,Q).
