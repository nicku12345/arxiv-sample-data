Suppose \mu is a partition of n and \lambda a composition of n, and let S^\mu, M^\lambda denote the Specht module and permutation module defined by Dipper and James for the Iwahori--Hecke algebra \mathscr{H}_n of the symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_n. We give an explicit fast algorithm for expressing a tableau homomorphism \hat\phi_A:S^\mu\to M^\lambda as a linear combination of semistandard homomorphisms. Along the way we provide a utility result related to removing rows from tableaux.
