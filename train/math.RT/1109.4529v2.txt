Let F be a local field and E/F be a separable extension of degree n. Regard T=\text{Res}_{E/F} \mathbb{G}_m as an elliptic maximal torus of G=\mathrm{GL}_n. We can construct an admissible embedding of L-groups {}^LT\hookrightarrow {}^LG using Langlands-Shelstad \chi-data. Such embedding gives rise to an induced representation of the Weil group W_F of F from a character of W_E. The relation between induced representations and admissible embeddings provides a different interpretation of the work of Bushnell-Henniart on the essentially tame local Langlands correspondence.
