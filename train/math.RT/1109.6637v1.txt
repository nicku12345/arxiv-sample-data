Let mathfrak{g} be a restricted Lie superalgebra over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>2. Let \mathfrak{u}(\mathfrak{g}) denote the restricted enveloping algebra of \mathfrak{g}. In this paper we prove that the cohomology ring \HH^\bullet(\fu(\fg), k) is finitely generated. This allows one to define support varieties for finite dimensional \fu(\fg)-supermodules. We also show that support varieties for finite dimensional \fu(\fg) supermodules satisfy the desirable properties of support variety theory.
