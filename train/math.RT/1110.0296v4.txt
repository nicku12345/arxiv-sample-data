We present (with proof) a new family of decomposable Specht modules for the symmetric group in characteristic 2. These Specht modules are labelled by partitions of the form (a,3,1^b), and are the first new examples found for thirty years. Our method of proof is to exhibit summands isomorphic to irreducible Specht modules, by constructing explicit homomorphisms between Specht modules.
