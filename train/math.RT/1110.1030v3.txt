We study the n-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with singular potential V_\lambda(x)=\lambda |x|^{-2}. Its solution space is studied as a global representation of \widetilde{SL(2,\R)}\times O(n). A special subspace of solutions for which the action globalizes is constructed via nonstandard induction outside the semisimple category. The space of K-finite vectors is calculated, obtaining conditions for \lambda so that this space is non-empty. The direct sum of solution spaces, over such admissible values of \lambda is studied as a representation of the 2n+1-dimensional Heisenberg group.
