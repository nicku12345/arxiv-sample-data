A unitary representation of a, possibly infinite dimensional, Lie group G is called semi-bounded if the corresponding operators id\pi(x) from the derived representations are uniformly bounded from above on some non-empty open subset of the Lie algebra g. Not every Lie group has non-trivial semibounded unitary representations, so that it becomes an important issue to decide when this is the case. In the present paper we describe a complete solution of this problem for the class of generalized oscillator groups, which are semidirect products of Heisenberg groups with a one-parameter group \gamma. For these groups it turns out that the existence of non-trivial semibounded representations is equivalent to the existence of so-called semi-equicontinuous non-trivial coadjoint orbits, a purely geometric condition on the coadjoint action. This in turn can be expressed by a positivity condition on the Hamiltonian function corresponding to the infinitesimal generator D of \gamma. A central point of our investigations is that we make no assumption on the structure of the spectrum of D. In particular, D can be any skew-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space.
