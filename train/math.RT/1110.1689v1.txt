In this notes, we will give an exposition of some results on the method of partial conjugation action. We first discuss the partial conjugation action of a parabolic subgroup of a Coxeter group. We then discuss some applications to Lusztig's G-stable pieces and its affine generalization. We also discuss some recent work on the \s-conjugacy classes of loop groups and affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties.
