For a finite group scheme G over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>0 we study G-modules M, which are defined in terms of properties of their pull-backs along p-points of G. We show that the corresponding subcategories strongly depend on the structure of G. The second part of the paper discusses recent work by Carlson-Friedlander-Suslin concerning the subcategory of equal images modules from the vantage point of Auslander-Reiten theory.
