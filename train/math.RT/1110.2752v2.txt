We define global Weyl modules for twisted loop algebras and analyze their high- est weight spaces, which are in fact isomorphic to Laurent polynomial rings in finitely many variables. We are able to show that the global Weyl module is a free module of finite rank over these rings. Furthermore we prove, that there exist injective maps from the global Weyl modules for twisted loop algebras into a direct sum of global Weyl modules for untwisted loop algebras. Relations between local Weyl modules for twisted and untwisted generalized current algebras are known; we provide for the first time a relation on global Weyl modules.
