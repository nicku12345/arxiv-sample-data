We introduce the notion of a generalized spin representation of the maximal compact subalgebra of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra in order to show that, if defined over a formally real field, every such subalgebra has a non-trivial reductive finite-dimensional quotient. The appendix illustrates how to compute the isomorphism types of these quotients for the real E_n series. In passing this provides an elementary way of determining the isomorphism types of the maximal compact subalgebras of the semisimple split real Lie algebras of types E_6, E_7, E_8.
