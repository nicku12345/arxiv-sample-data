The symplectic blob algebras are a family of finite dimensional noncommutative algebras over \mathbb{Z}[X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4,X_5,X_6] that can be defined in terms of planar diagrams in a way that extends the Temperley-Lieb and (ordinary) blob algebras.   In this paper we construct a new "tensor space" representation of the symplectic blob algebra \mathcal{A} \otimes \sba for each n \in \mathbb{N}, for \mathcal{A} a particular commutative ring with indeterminates. The form of this representation is motivated by the XXZ representation of the Temperley-Lieb algebra \TL_n \cite{jimbo86} and the related Martin-Woodcock representation of the blob algebra b_n \cite{martinwoodcock2003}. For k an algebraically closed field, and for any (\delta,\delta_L,\delta_R,\kappa_L,\kappa_R,\kappa) \in k^{6}, the algebra \sba specialises to a k-algebra \sba(\delta,\delta_L,\delta_R,\kappa_L,\kappa_R,\kappa). For any such specialisation, our representation passes to a \sba(\delta,\delta_L,\delta_R,\kappa_L,\kappa_R,\kappa)-module \mathcal{V}(n).
