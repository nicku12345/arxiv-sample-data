Let \Field be an algebraically closed field. For n \in \mathbb{N} and \delta, \delta_L, \delta_R, \kappa_L, \kappa_R, \kappa \in \Field, the symplectic blob algebra \sba(\delta, \delta_L, \delta_R, \kappa_L, \kappa_R, \kappa) is a finite dimensional non-commutative \Field-algebra that may be viewed as an extension of the Temperley-Lieb algebra.   In a previous paper, we defined, for any n \in \mathbb{N}, a tensor space module \tensor[_\sba]{\mathcal{V}(n)}{}. In this paper we generalise an argument used by Martin and Ryom-Hansen in their study of the (ordinary) blob algebra to show that when \sba is quasihereditary the module \tensor[_\sba]{\mathcal{V}(n)}{} is full-tilting.
