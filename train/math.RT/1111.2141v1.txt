Let g be a complex simple Lie algebra, and h be a Cartan subalgebra. In the end of 1990s, B. Kostant defined two filtrations on h, one using the Clifford algebras and the odd analogue of the Harish-Chandra projection hc: Cl(g) \to Cl(h), and the other one using the canonical isomorphism \check{h} = h^* (here \check{h} is the Cartan subalgebra in the simple Lie algebra corresponding to the dual root system) and the adjoint action of the principal sl2-triple. Kostant conjectured that the two filtrations coincide. The two filtrations arise in very different contexts, and comparing them proved to be a difficult task. Y. Bazlov settled the conjecture for g of type A using explicit expressions for primitive invariants in the exterior algebra of g. Up to now this approach did not lead to a proof for all simple Lie algebras. Recently, A. Joseph proved that the second Kostant filtration coincides with the filtration on h induced by the generalized Harish-Chandra projection (Ug \otimes g)^g \to Sh \otimes h and the evaluation at \rho \in h^*. In this note, we prove that Joseph's result is equivalent to the Kostant Conjecture. We also show that the standard Harish-Chandra projection Ug \to Sh composed with evaluation at \rho induces the same filtration on h.
