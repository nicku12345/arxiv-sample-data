Let \Bbbk be a commutative ring and I a category. As a generalization of a \Bbbk-category with a (pseudo) action of a group we consider a family of \Bbbk-categories with a (pseudo, lax, or oplax) action of I, namely an oplax functor from I to the 2-category of small \Bbbk-categories. We investigate derived equivalences of those oplax functors, and establish a Morita type theorem for them. This gives a base of investigations of derived equivalences of Grothendieck constructions of those oplax functors.
