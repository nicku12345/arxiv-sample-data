In recent work, Graham has constructed a variety with a map to the nilpotent cone which is similar in some ways to the Springer resolution. One aspect in which Graham's map differs is that it is not in general an isomorphism over the principal orbit, but rather the universal covering map. This map gives rise to a certain semisimple perverse sheaf on the nilpotent cone, and we discuss here the problem of describing the summands of this perverse sheaf. For type A_n, a key tool is a known combinatorial description of an affine paving of Springer fibers.
