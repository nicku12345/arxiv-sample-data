A complete system of pairwise orthogonal minimal idempotents for Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras is obtained by a consecutive evaluation of a rational function in several variables on sequences of quantum contents of up-down tableaux. A by-product of the construction is a one-parameter family of fusion procedures for Hecke algebras. Classical limits to two different fusion procedures for Brauer algebras are described.
