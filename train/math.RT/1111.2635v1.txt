Let G be a real quaternionic classical group \GL_n(\bH), \Sp(p,q) or \oO^*(2n). We define an extension \breve G of G with the following property: it contains G as a subgroup of index two, and for every x\in G, there is an element \breve g\in \breve G\setminus G such that \breve g x\breve{g}^{-1}=x^{-1}. This is similar to Moeglin-Vigneras-Waldspurger's extensions of non-quaternionic classical groups.
