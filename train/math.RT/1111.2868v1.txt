In this expository paper, we provide an overview of the Gelfand-Zeiltin integrable system on the Lie algebra of n\times n complex matrices \fgl(n,\C) introduced by Kostant and Wallach in 2006. We discuss results concerning the geometry of the set of strongly regular elements, which consists of the points where Gelfand-Zeitlin flow is Lagrangian. We use the theory of K_{n}=GL(n-1,\C)\times GL(1,\C)-orbits on the flag variety \mathcal{B}_{n} of GL(n,\C) to describe the strongly regular elements in the nilfiber of the moment map of the system. We give an overview of the general theory of orbits of a symmetric subgroup of a reductive algebraic group acting on its flag variety, and illustrate how the general theory can be applied to understand the specific example of K_{n} and GL(n,\C).
