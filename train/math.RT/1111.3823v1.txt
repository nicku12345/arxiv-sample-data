Given a complex simply connected simple algebraic group G of exceptional type and a maximal parabolic subgroup P \subset G, we classify all triples (G,P,H) such that H \subset G is a maximal reductive subgroup acting spherically on G/P. In addition we derive branching rules for \text{res}^G_H (V^*_{k\omega_i}), k \in \N, where \omega_i is the fundamental weight associated to P.   This is the first of two parts of a project to classify all such triples and corresponding branching rules for all simply connected simple algebraic groups.
