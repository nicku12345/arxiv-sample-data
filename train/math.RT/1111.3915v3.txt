We apply techniques introduced by Clerc, Kobayashi, Orsted and Pevzner to study the degenerate principal series of Sp(n,C). An explicit description of the K-types is provided and Knapp-Stein normalised operators are realised a symplectic Fourier transforms, and their K-spectrum explicitely computed. Reducibility phenomena are analysed in terms of K-types and eigenvalues of intertwining operators. We also construct a new model for these representations, in which Knapp-Stein intertwiners take an algebraic form.
