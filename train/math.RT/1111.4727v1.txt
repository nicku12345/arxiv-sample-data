Let G be a simply connected exponential solvable Lie group, H a closed connected subgroup, and let \tau be a representation of G induced from a unitary character \chi_f of H. The spectrum of \tau corresponds via the orbit method to the set G\cdot A_\tau / G of coadjoint orbits that meet the spectral variety A_\tau = f + \h^\perp. We prove that the spectral measure of \tau  is absolutely continuous with respect to the Plancherel measure if and only if H acts freely on some point of A_\tau. As a corollary we show that if G is nonunimodular, then \tau has admissible vectors if and only if the preceding orbital condition holds.
