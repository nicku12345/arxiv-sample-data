Let F be a non-Archimedean local field with finite residue field. Let \mathcal{A}^{et}_n(F) be the collection of isomorphism classes of essentially tame irreducible supercuspidal representations of \mathrm{GL}_n(F) studied by Bushnell-Henniart. It is known that we can parameterize \mathcal{A}^{et}_n(F) by the collection P_n(F) of equivalence classes of admissible pairs (E, \xi) consisting of a tamely ramified extension E/F of degree n and an F-admissible character \xi of E^\times. We are interested in a finite symplectic module V = V(\xi) arising from the construction of the supercuspidal representation from the character \xi. This module V is known to admit an orthogonal decomposition with respect to a symplectic form depending on \xi. We work with a fixed ambient module U containing V and show that U decomposes in a way analogous to the root space decomposition of the Lie algebra \mathfrak{gl}_n(F). We then obtain a complete orthogonal decomposition of the submodule V by restriction. Such decomposition relates the finite symplectic module of a supercuspidal and certain admissible embedding of L-groups. This relation provides a different interpretation on the essentially tame local Langlands correspondence.
