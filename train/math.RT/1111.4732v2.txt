Let F be a non-Archimedean local field and G be the general linear group \mathrm{GL}_n over F. Based on the previous results of the author, we can describe the Langlands parameter of an essentially tame supercuspidal representation of G(F) by those admissible embeddings of L-groups constructed by Langlands and Shelstad. We therefore provide a different interpretation on Bushnell and Henniart's essentially tame local Langlands correspondence.
