Let N be a step two connected and simply connected non commutative nilpotent Lie group which is square-integrable modulo the center. Let Z be the center of N. Assume that N=P\rtimes M such that P, and M are simply connected, connected abelian Lie groups, M acts non-trivially on P by automorphisms and \dim P/Z=\dim M. We study band-limited subspaces of L^2(N) which admit Parseval frames generated by discrete translates of a single function. We also find characteristics of band-limited subspaces of L^2(N) which do not admit a single Parseval frame. We also provide some conditions under which continuous wavelets transforms related to the left regular representation admit discretization, by some discrete set \Gamma\subset N. Finally, we show some explicit examples in the last section.
