We study the structure of the indecomposable direct summands of tensor products of two restricted simple SL_3(K)-modules, where K is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p \geq 5. We give a characteristic-free algorithm for the computation of the decomposition of such a tensor product into indecomposable modules.   The p<5 case for \SL_3(K) was studied in the authors' earlier paper. In this paper we show that for characteristics p\geq 5 all the indecomposable summands are rigid, in contrast to the situation in characteristic 3.
