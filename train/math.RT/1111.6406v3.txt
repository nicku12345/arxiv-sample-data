We consider spherical principal series representations of the semisimple Lie group of rank one G=SO(n, 1; \mathbb K), \mathbb K=\br, \bc, \bh. There is a family of unitarizable representations \pi_{\nu} of G for \nu in an interval on \mathbb R^+, the so-called complementary series, and subquotient or subrepresentations of G for \nu being negative integers. We consider the restriction of (\pi_{\nu}, G) under the subgroup H=SO(n-1, 1; \mathbb K). We prove the appearing of discrete components. The corresponding results for the exceptional Lie group F_{4(-20)} and its subgroup Spin(8,1) are also obtained.
