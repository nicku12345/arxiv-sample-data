In a recent preprint, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh considered the spectral decomposition of the space L^2(X), where X = H\G is a spherical variety and G is a real or p-adic group, and stated a conjecture describing this decomposition in terms of a dual group \check{G}_X associated to X. The main purpose of this paper is to verify the above conjecture in many cases when X, has low rank. In particular, we demonstrate this conjecture for many cases when X has rank 1, and also some cases when X has rank 2 or 3.
