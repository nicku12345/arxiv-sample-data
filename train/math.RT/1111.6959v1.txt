We prove a BGG type reciprocity law for the category of finite dimensional modules over algebraic supergroups satisfying certain conditions. The equivalent of a standard module in this case is a virtual module called Euler characteristic due to its geometric interpretation. In the orthosymplectic case, we also describe indecomposable projective modules in terms of those Euler characteristics.
