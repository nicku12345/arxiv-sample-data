Let K be a normal subgroup of the finite group H. To a block of a K-interior H-algebra we associate a group extension, and we prove that this extension is isomorphic to an extension associated to a block given by the Brauer homomorphism.   This may be regarded as a generalization and an alternative treatment of Dade's results "Block extensions" Section 12.
