We calculate all inequivalent irreducible representations of \S_4 by specifying the matrices for adjacent transpositions and indicating how to obtain general permutations in \S_4 from these transpositions. We employ standard Young tableaux methods as found in Sagan's \emph{The Symmetric Group: Representations, Combinatorial Algorithms, and Symmetric Functions} (2001).
