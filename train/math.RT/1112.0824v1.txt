Let W be an extended affine Weyl group. We prove that minimal length elements w_{\co} of any conjugacy class \co of W satisfy some special properties, generalizing results of Geck and Pfeiffer \cite{GP} on finite Weyl groups. We then introduce the "class polynomials" for affine Hecke algebra H and prove that T_{w_\co}, where \co runs over all the conjugacy classes of W, forms a basis of the cocenter H/[H, H]. We also classify the conjugacy classes satisfying a generalization of Lusztig's conjecture \cite{L4}.
