Let G_n=\operatorname{GL}_n(F), where F is a non-archimedean local field with residue characteristic p. Our starting point is the Bernstein-decomposition of the representation category of G_n over an algebraically closed field of characteristic \ell \neq p into blocks. In level zero, we associate to each block a replacement for the Iwahori-Hecke algebra which provides a Morita-equivalence just as in the complex case. Additionally, we will explain how this gives rise to a description of an arbitrary G_n-block in terms of simple G_m-blocks (for m\leq n), paralleling the approach of Bushnell and Kutzko in the complex setting.
