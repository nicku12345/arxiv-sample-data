Let G be the symplectic group, \Phi=C_n its root system, B\subset G its standard Borel subgroup, W the Weyl group of \Phi. To each involution \sigma\in W one can assign the B-orbit \Omega_{\sigma} contained in the dual space of the Lie algebra of the unipotent radical of B. We prove that \Omega_{\sigma} is contained in the Zariski closure of \Omega_{\tau} if and only of \sigma\leq\tau with respect to the Bruhat--Chevalley order. We also prove that \dim\Omega_{\sigma} is equal to l(\sigma), the length of \sigma in W.
