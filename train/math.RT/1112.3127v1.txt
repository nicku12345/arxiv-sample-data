We prove that the representation ring of the symmetric group on n letters is generated by the exterior powers of its natural (n-1)-dimensional representation. The proof we give illustrates a strikingly simple formula due to Y. Dvir. We provide an application and investigate a possible generalization of this result to some other reflection groups.
