Atypicality is a fundamental combinatorial invariant for simple supermodules of a basic Lie superalgebra. Boe, Nakano, and the author gave a conjectural geometric interpretation of atypicality via support varieties. Inspired by low dimensional topology, Geer, Patureau-Mirand, and the author gave a generalization of the Kac-Wakimoto atypicality conjecture. We prove both of these conjectures for the Lie superalgebra osp(m|2n).
