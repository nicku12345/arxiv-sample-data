In a recent preprint Kodiyalam and Verma give a particularly simple Gelfand model for the symmetric group that is built naturally on the space of involutions. In this manuscript we give a natural extension of Kodiyalam and Verma's model to a Gelfand model for Weyl groups of type B_{n} and D_{2n+1}. Then we define an explicit isomorphism between this Gelfand model and the polynomial model using a technique that we call telescopic decomposition.
