A square matrix is nonderogatory if its Jordan blocks have distinct eigenvalues. We give canonical forms (i) for nonderogatory complex matrices up to unitary similarity and (ii) for pairs of complex matrices up to similarity, in which one matrix has distinct eigenvalues. The types of these canonical forms are given by undirected and, respectively, directed graphs with no undirected cycles.
