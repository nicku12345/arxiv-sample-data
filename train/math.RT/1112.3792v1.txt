We find a new representation of the simple Lie algebra of type E_6 on the polynomial algebra in 16 variables, which gives a fractional representation of the corresponding Lie group on 16-dimensional space. Using this representation and Shen's idea of mixed product, we construct a functor from D_5-{\bf Mod} to E_6-{\bf Mod}. A condition for the functor to map a finite-dimensional irreducible D_5-module to an infinite-dimensional irreducible E_6-module is obtained. Our general frame also gives a direct polynomial extension from irreducible D_5-modules to irreducible E_6-modules. The obtained infinite-dimensional irreducible E_6-modules are ({\cal G},K)-modules in terms of Lie group representations. The results could be used in studying the quantum field theory with E_6 symmetry and symmetry of partial differential equations.
