We construct a new family of irreducible unitary representations of a finitely generated virtually free group L. We prove furthermore a general result concerning representations of Gromov hyperbolic groups that are weakly contained in the regular representation, thus implying that all the representations in this family can be realized on the boundary of L. As a corollary, we obtain an analogue of Herz majorization principle.
