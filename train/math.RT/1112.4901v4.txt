We give an AB-factorization of the supercharacter table of the group of n\times n unipotent upper triangular matrices over \FF_q, where A is a lower-triangular matrix with entries in \ZZ[q] and B is a unipotent upper-triangular matrix with entries in \ZZ[q^{-1}]. To this end we introduce a q deformation of a new power-sum basis of the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions in noncommutative variables. The factorization is obtain from the transition matrices between the supercharacter basis, the q-power-sum basis and the superclass basis. This is similar to the decomposition of the character table of the symmetric group S_n given by the transition matrices between Schur functions, monomials and power-sums.   We deduce some combinatorial results associated to this decomposition. In particular we compute the determinant of the supercharacter table.
