Let H be a finite dimensional hereditary algebra over an algebraically closed field, and let \mathcal{C}_{H} be the corresponding cluster category. We give a description of the (standard) fundamental domain of \mathcal{C}_{H}  in the bounded derived category \mathcal{D}^{b}(H), and of the cluster-tilting objects, in terms of the category \mod\Gamma \ of finitely generated modules over a suitable tilted algebra % \Gamma . Furthermore, we apply this description to obtain (the quiver of) an arbitrary cluster-tilted algebra.
