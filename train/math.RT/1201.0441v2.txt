We present an easily applicable sufficient condition for standard Koszul algebras to be Koszul with respect to \Delta. If a quasi-hereditary algebra \L is Koszul with respect to \Delta, then \L and the Yoneda extension algebra of \Delta are Koszul dual in a sense explained below, implying in particular that their bounded derived categories of finitely generated graded modules are equivalent. We also prove that the extension algebra of \Delta is Koszul in the classical sense.
