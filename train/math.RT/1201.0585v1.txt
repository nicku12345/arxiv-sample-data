In 1979, Kazhdan and Lusztig developed a combinatorial theory associated with Coxeter groups. They defined in particular partitions of the group in left and two-sided cells. In 1983, Lusztig generalized this theory to Hecke algebras of Coxeter groups with unequal parameters. We propose a definition of left cells and two-sided cells for complex reflection groups, based on ramification theory for Calogero-Moser spaces. These spaces have been defined via rational Cherednik algebras by Etingof and Ginzburg. We conjecture that these coincide with Kazhdan-Lusztig cells, for real reflection groups. Counterparts of families of irreducible characters have been studied by Gordon and Martino, and we provide here a version of left cell representations. The Calogero-Moser cells will be studied in details in a forthcoming paper, providing thus several results supporting our conjecture.
