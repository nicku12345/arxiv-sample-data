Tropical friezes are the tropical analogues of Coxeter-Conway frieze patterns. In this note, we study them using triangulated categories. A tropical frieze on a 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated category \mathcal{C} is a function satisfying a certain addition formula. We show that when \mathcal{C} is the cluster category of a Dynkin quiver, the tropical friezes on {\mathcal{C}} are in bijection with the n-tuples in {\mathbb{Z}}^n, any tropical frieze f on \mathcal{C} is of a special form, and there exists a cluster-tilting object such that f simultaneously takes non-negative values or non-positive values on all its indecomposable direct summands. Using similar techniques, we give a proof of a conjecture of Ringel for cluster-additive functions on stable translation quivers.
