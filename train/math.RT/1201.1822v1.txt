We study higher cluster tilting objects in generalized higher cluster categories arising from dg algebras of higher Calabi-Yau dimension. Taking advantage of silting mutations of Aihara-Iyama, we obtain a class of m-cluster tilting objects in generalized m-cluster categories. For generalized m-cluster categories arising from strongly (m+2)-Calabi-Yau dg algebras, by using truncations of minimal cofibrant resolutions of simple modules, we prove that each almost complete m-cluster tilting P-object has exactly m+1 complements with periodicity property. This leads us to the conjecture that each liftable almost complete m-cluster tilting object has exactly m+1 complements in generalized m-cluster categories arising from m-rigid good completed deformed preprojective dg algebras.
