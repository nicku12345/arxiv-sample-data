We establish a connection between planar rook algebras and tensor representations \VV^{\otimes k} of the natural two-dimensional representation \VV of the general linear Lie superalgebra \gl. In particular, we show that the centralizer algebra \maths{End}_{\gl}(\VV^{\otimes k}) is the planar rook algebra \CC \mathsf{P}_{k-1} for all k \geq 1, and we exhibit an explicit decomposition of \VV^{\otimes k} into irreducible \gl-modules. We obtain similar results for the quantum enveloping algebra \UU_\qq(\gl) and its natural two-dimensional module \VV_\qq.
