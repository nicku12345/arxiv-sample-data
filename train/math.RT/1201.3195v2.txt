This paper shows a new phenomenon in higher cluster tilting theory. For each positive integer d, we exhibit a triangulated category C with the following properties.   On the one hand, the d-cluster tilting subcategories of C have very simple mutation behaviour: Each indecomposable object has exactly d mutations. On the other hand, the weakly d-cluster tilting subcategories of C which lack functorial finiteness can have much more complicated mutation behaviour: For each 0 <= \ell <= d-1, we show a weakly d-cluster tilting subcategory T_{\ell} which has an indecomposable object with precisely \ell mutations.   The category C is the algebraic triangulated category generated by a (d+1)-spherical object and can be thought of as a higher cluster category of Dynkin type A infinity.
