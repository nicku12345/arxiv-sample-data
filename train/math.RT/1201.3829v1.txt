We study primitive ideals in the enveloping algebra of finitary locally finite infinite-dimensional complex Lie algebras. In particular we investigate the annihilators of the simple objects in the category of tensor modules. This category has been studied in \cite{PStyr} and \cite{PS}. Moreover we prove that a simple tensor module is completely determined by its annihilator and we introduce a partial order on pairs of Young diagrams that we use to describe the inclusions between the annihilators of the simple tensor modules.
