We present three examples of Green biset functors for which their simple modules can be parametrized. These are particular cases of a conjecture by Serge Bouc classifying the simple modules over a Green biset functor A, that generalizes the classification of simple biset functors. We also prove this conjecture under certain hypothesis for A.
