Let G be a complex simply-connected semisimple Lie group and let \g=\hbox{\rm Lie}\,G. Let \g = \n_- +\hh + \n be a triangular decomposition of \g. One readily has that \hbox{\rm Cent}\,U(\n) is isomorphic to the ring S(\n)^{\n} of symmetric invariants. Using the cascade {\cal B} of strongly orthogonal roots, some time ago we proved (see [K]) that S(\n)^{\n} is a polynomial ring \Bbb C[\xi_1,...,\xi_m] where m is the cardinality of {\cal B}. The authors in [LW] introduce a very nice representation-theoretic method for the construction of certain elements in S(\n)^{\n}. A key lemma in [LW] is incorrect but the idea is in fact valid. In our paper here we modify the construction so as to yield these elements in S(\n)^{\n} and use the [LW] result to prove a theorem of Tony Joseph.
