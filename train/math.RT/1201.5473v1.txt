We find a new representation of the simple Lie algebra of type E_7 on the polynomial algebra in 27 variables, which gives a fractional representation of the corresponding Lie group on 27-dimensional space. Using this representation and Shen's idea of mixed product, we construct a functor from E_6-{\bf Mod} to E_7-{\bf Mod}. A condition for the functor to map a finite-dimensional irreducible E_6-module to an infinite-dimensional irreducible E_7-module is obtained. Our general frame also gives a direct polynomial extension from irreducible E_6-modules to irreducible E_7-modules. The obtained infinite-dimensional irreducible E_7-modules are ({\cal G},K)-modules in terms of Lie group representations. The results could be used in studying the quantum field theory with E_7 symmetry and symmetry of partial differential equations.
