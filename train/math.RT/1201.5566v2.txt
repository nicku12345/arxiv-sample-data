We introduce the computer algebra package {\sf PyCox}, written entirely in the {\sf Python} language. It implements a set of algorithms - in a spirit similar to the older {\sf CHEVIE} system - for working with Coxeter groups and Hecke algebras. This includes a new variation of the traditional algorithm for computing Kazhdan--Lusztig cells and W-graphs, which works efficiently for all finite groups of rank \leq 8 (except E_8). We also discuss the computation of Lusztig's leading coefficients of character values and distinguished involutions (which works for E_8 as well). Our experiments suggest a re-definition of Lusztig's "special" representations which, conjecturally, should also apply to the unequal parameter case.
