The transfer factors for standard endoscopy involve, among other things, the Langlands-Shelstad splitting invariant. This note introduces a twisted version of that splitting invariant. The twisted splitting invariant is then used to define a better twisted factor \Delta_I. In addition we correct a sign error in the definition of twisted transfers. There are two ways to correct the sign error. One way yields twisted transfer factors \Delta' that are compatible with the classical Langlands correspondence. The other way yields twisted transfer factors \Delta_D that are compatible with a renormalized version of the Langlands correspondence.
