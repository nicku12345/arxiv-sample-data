Let \mathfrak{g} be a finite-dimensional real or complex Lie algebra, and let \mu \in \mathfrak{g}^{*}. In the first part of the paper, the relation is discussed between the derived algebra of the stabilizer of \mu and the set of coadjoint orbits which have the same dimension as the orbit of \mu. In the second part, semisimple Lie algebras are considered, and the relation is discussed between the derived algebra of a centralizer and sheets.
