For each finite, irreducible Coxeter system (W,S), Lusztig has associated a set of "unipotent characters" \Uch(W). There is also a notion of a "Fourier transform" on the space of functions \Uch(W) \to \RR, due to Lusztig for Weyl groups and to Brou\'e, Lusztig, and Malle in the remaining cases. This paper concerns a certain W-representation \varrho_{W} in the vector space generated by the involutions of W. Our main result is to show that the irreducible multiplicities of \varrho_W are given by the Fourier transform of a unique function \epsilon : \Uch(W) \to \{-1,0,1\}, which for various reasons serves naturally as a heuristic definition of the Frobenius-Schur indicator on \Uch(W). The formula we obtain for \epsilon extends prior work of Casselman, Kottwitz, Lusztig, and Vogan addressing the case in which W is a Weyl group. We include in addition a succinct description of the irreducible decomposition of \varrho_W derived by Kottwitz when (W,S) is classical, and prove that \varrho_{W} defines a Gelfand model if and only if (W,S) has type A_n, H_3, or I_2(m) with m odd. We show finally that a conjecture of Kottwitz connecting the decomposition of \varrho_W to the left cells of W holds in all non-crystallographic types, and observe that a weaker form of Kottwitz's conjecture holds in general. In giving these results, we carefully survey the construction and notable properties of the set \Uch(W) and its attached Fourier transform.
