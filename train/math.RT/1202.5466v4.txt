In this work infinitesimal deformations of the model filiform \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2-color Lie superalgebra have been studied. All the filiform \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2-color Lie superalgebras can be obtained by means of infinitesimal deformations, hence the importance of these. Thus, in particular, we give a family of filiform \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2-color Lie superalgebras via linearly integrable deformations.
