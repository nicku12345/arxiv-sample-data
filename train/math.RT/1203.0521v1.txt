We prove a conjecture in \cite{L} stating that certain polynomials P^{\sigma}_{y,w}(q) introduced in \cite{LV1} for twisted involutions in an affine Weyl group give (-q)-analogues of weight multiplicities of the Langlands dual group \check{G}. We also prove that the signature of a naturally defined hermitian form on each irreducible representation of \check{G} can be expressed in terms of these polynomials P^{\sigma}_{y,w}(q).
