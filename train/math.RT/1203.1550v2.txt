Let \sO be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field K and residue field k. A quasi-hereditary algebra \wA over \sO provides a bridge between the representation theory of the quasi-hereditary algebra \wA_K:=K\otimes \wA over the field K and the quasi-hereditary algebra A_k:=k\otimes_\sO\wA over k. In one important example, \wA_K--mod is a full subcategory of the category of modules for a quantum enveloping algebra while \wA_k--mod is a full subcategory of the category of modules for a reductive group in positive characteristic. This paper considers first the question of when the positively graded algebra \gr \wA:= \bigoplus_{n\geq 0}(\wA\cap\rad^n\wA_K)/(\wA\cap\rad^{n+1}\wA_K) is quasi-hereditary. A main result gives sufficient conditions that \gr\wA be quasi-hereditary. The main requirement is that each graded module \gr\wDelta(\lambda) arising from a \wA-standard (Weyl) module \wDelta(\lambda) have an irreducible head. An additional hypothesis requires that the graded algebra \gr \wA_K be quasi-hereditary, a property recently proved by us to hold in some important cases involving quantum enveloping algebras. In the case where \wA arises from regular dominant weights for a quantum enveloping algebra at a primitive pth root of unity for a prime p>2h-2 (where h is the Coxeter number), a second main result shows that \gr\wA is quasi-hereditary. The proof depends on previous work of the authors, including a continuation of the methods there involving tightly graded subalgebras, and a development of a quantum deformation theory over \sO, worthy of attention in its own right, extending the work of Andersen-Jantzen-Soergel. As we point out, this work provides an essential step in our work on p-filtrations of Weyl modules for reductive algebraic groups over fields of positive characteristic.
