We study the monoid of so called projection functors \p{S} attached to simple modules S of a finite dimensional algebra, which appear naturally in the study of torsion pairs. We determine defining relations in special cases of path algebras. For the linearly oriented Dynkin quiver of Type A, we get an isomorphism to the monoid of non-decreasing parking functions. Moreover we give an explicit isomorphism between the monoid algebra of non-decreasing parking functions and a certain incidence algebra independent of the field.
