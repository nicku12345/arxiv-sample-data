Let W_a be an affine Weyl group and \eta:W_a\longrightarrow W_0 be the natural projection to the corresponding finite Weyl group. We say that w\in W_a has finite Coxeter part if \eta(w) is conjugate to a Coxeter element of W_0. The elements with finite Coxeter part is a union of conjugacy classes of W_a. We show that for each conjugacy class \mathcal{O} of W_a with finite Coxeter part there exits a unique maximal proper parabolic subgroup W_J of W_a, such that the set of minimal length elements in \mathcal{O} is exactly the set of Coxeter elements in W_J. Similar results hold for twisted conjugacy classes.
