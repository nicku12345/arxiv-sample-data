Let \mathfrak{co}(J) be the conformal algebra of a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra J. We show that a (non-trivial) unitary highest weight \mathfrak{co}(J)-module has the smallest positive Gelfand-Kirillov dimension if and only if a certain quadratic relation is satisfied in the universal enveloping algebra U(\mathfrak{co}(J)_{\mathbb{C}}). In particular, we find an quadratic element in U(\mathfrak{co}(J)_{\mathbb{C}}). A prime ideal in U(\mathfrak{co}(J)_{\mathbb{C}}) equals the Joseph ideal if and only if it contains this quadratic element.
