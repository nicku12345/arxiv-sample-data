We give a correspondence between (n-1)-DTr-selfinjective algebras and algebras with dominant dimension and selinjective dimension being both n for any n bigger than 1 . Furthermore, we show the relation between the module categories of the two kinds of algebras. At last we show the sepcial condition n = 2.
