Given a cluster-tilted algebra B, we study its first Hochschild cohomology group HH^1(B) with coefficients in the B-B-bimodule B. If C is a tilted algebra such that B is the relation extension of C, then we show that if C is constrained, or else if B is tame, then HH^1(B) is isomorphic, as a k-vector space, to the direct sum of HH^1(C) with k^{n\_{B,C}}, where n\_{B,C} is an invariant linking the bound quivers of B and C. In the representation-finite case, HH^1(B) can be read off simply by looking at the quiver of B.
