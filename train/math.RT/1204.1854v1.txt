We study the PBW-filtration on the highest weight representations V(\la) of the Lie algebras of type {\tt A}_{n} and {\tt C}_{n}. This filtration is induced by the standard degree filtration on \U(\fn^-). In previous papers, the authors studied the filtration and the associated graded algebras and modules over the complex numbers. The aim of this paper is to present a proof of the results which holds over the integers and hence makes the whole construction available over any field.
