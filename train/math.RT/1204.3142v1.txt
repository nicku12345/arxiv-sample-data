In 1990, Beilinson-Lusztig-MacPherson (BLM) discovered a realization \cite[5.7]{BLM} for quantum \frak{gl}_n via a geometric setting of quantum Schur algebras. We will generailze their result to the classical affine case. More precisely, we first use Ringel-Hall algebras to construct an integral form {\mathcal U}_{\mathbb Z}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n) of {\mathcal U}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n), where {\mathcal U}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n) is the universal enveloping algebra of the loop algebra \hat{\frak{gl}}_n:=\frak{gl}_n(\mathbb Q)\otimes\mathbb Q[t,t^{-1}]. We then establish the stabilization property of multiplication for the classical affine Schur algebras. This stabilization property leads to the BLM realization of {\mathcal U}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n) and {\mathcal U}_{\mathbb Z}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n). In particular, we conclude that {\mathcal U}_{\mathbb Z}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n) is a \mathbb Z-Hopf subalgebra of {\mathcal U}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n). As a bonus, this method leads to an explicit \mathbb Z-basis for {\mathcal U}_{\mathbb Z}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n), and it yields explicit multiplication formulas between generators and basis elements for {\mathcal U}_{\mathbb Z}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n). As an application, we will prove that the natural algebra homomorphism from {\mathcal U}_{\mathbb Z}(\hat{\frak{gl}}_n) to the affine Schur algebra over \mathbb Z is surjective.
