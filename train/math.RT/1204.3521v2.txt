Let A be a character sheaf on a reductive connected group G over an algebraically closed field. Assuming that the characteristic is not bad, we show that for certain conjugacy classes D in G the restriction of A to D is a local system up to shift; we also give a parametrization of unipotent cuspidal character sheaves on G in terms of restrictions to conjugacy classes. Without restriction on characteristic we define canonical bijections from the set of unipotent character sheaves on G (and from the set of unipotent representations of the corresponding split reductive group over a finite field) to a set combinatorially defined in terms of the Weyl group.
