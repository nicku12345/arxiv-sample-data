Let W be a finite Weyl group and \sg be a non-trivial graph automorphism of W. We show a remarkable relation between the \sg-twisted involution module for W and the Frobenius--Schur indicators of the unipotent characters of a corresponding twisted finite group of Lie type. This extends earlier results of Lusztig-Vogan for the untwisted case and then allows us to state a general result valid for any finite group of Lie type. Inspired by recent work of Marberg, we also formally define Frobenius--Schur indicators for "unipotent characters" of twisted dihedral groups.
