Let G be a connected reductive p-adic group and let \theta be an automorphism of G of order at most two. Suppose \pi is an irreducible smooth representation of G that is taken to its dual by \theta. The space V of \pi then carries a non-zero bilinear form (\mspace{7mu},\mspace{6mu}), unique up to scaling, with the invariance property (\pi(g)v, \pi({}^{\theta}g)w) = (v,w), for g \in G and v, w \in V. The form is easily seen to be symmetric or skew-symmetric and we set \varepsilon_\theta(\pi) = \pm1 accordingly. We use Cassleman's pairing (in commonly observed circumstances) to express \varepsilon_\theta(\pi) in terms of certain Jacquet modules of \pi and thus, via the Langlands classification, reduce the problem of determining the sign to the case of tempered representations. For the transpose-inverse involution of the general linear group, we show that the associated signs are always one.
