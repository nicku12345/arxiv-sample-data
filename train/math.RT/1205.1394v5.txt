This article classifies the real forms of Lie Superalgebra by Vogan diagrams, developing Borel and de Seibenthal theorem of semisimple Lie algebras for Lie superalgebras. A Vogan diagram is a Dynkin diagram of triplet (\mathfrak{g}_{C},\mathfrak{h_{\bar{0}}},\triangle^{+}), where \mathfrak{g}_{C} is a real Lie superalgebra, \mathfrak{h_{\bar{0}}} cartan subalgebra, \triangle^{+} positive root system. Although the classification of real forms of contragradient Lie superalgebras is already done. But our method is a quicker one to classify.
