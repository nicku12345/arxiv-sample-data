Let k be an algebraically closed field. Given an extension A : B of finite-dimensional k- algebras, we establish criteria ensuring that the representation-theoretic notion of polynomial growth is preserved under ascent and descent. These results are then used to show that principal blocks of finite group schemes of odd characteristic are of polynomial growth if and only if they are Morita equivalent to trivial extensions of radical square zero tame hereditary algebras. In that case, the blocks are of domestic representation type and the underlying group schemes are closely related to binary polyhedral group schemes.
