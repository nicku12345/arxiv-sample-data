Let G be a complex simply-connected semisimple Lie group and let \frak{g}= Lie G. Let \frak{g} = \frak{n}_- +\frak{h} + \frak{n} be a triangular decomposition of \frak{g}. One readily has that Cent\,U({\frak n}) is isomorphic to the ring S({\frak n})^{{\frak\n}} of symmetric invariants. Using the cascade {\cal B} of strongly orthogonal roots, some time ago we proved that S({\frak n})^{{\frak n} is a polynomial ring \Bbb C [\xi_1,...,\xi_m] where m is the cardinality of {\cal B}. Using this result we establish that the maximal coadjoint of N = exp \frak {n} has codimension m. Let \frak {b}= \frak {h} + \frak {n} so that the corresponding subgroup B is a Borel subgroup of G. Let \ell = rank \frak{g}. Then in this paper we prove the theorem that the maximal coadjoint orbit of B has codimension \ell - m so that the following statements (1) and (2) are equivalent: (1) -1 is in the Weyl group of G (i.e., \ell = m), and (2), B has a nonempty open coadjoint orbit. We remark that a nilpotent or a semisimple group cannot have a nonempty open coadjoint orbit. Celebrated examples where a solvable Lie group has a nonempty open coadjoint orbit are due to Piatetski--Shapiro in his counterexample construction of a bounded complex homogeneous domain which is not of Cartan type.
