We consider the conjugation-action of an arbitrary upper-block parabolic subgroup of GL_n(C) on the variety of x-nilpotent complex matrices. We obtain a criterion as to whether the action admits a finite number of orbits and specify a system of representatives for the orbits in the finite case of 2-nilpotent matrices. Furthermore, we give a set-theoretic description of their closures and specify the minimal degenerations in detail for the action of the Borel subgroup. Concerning the action on the nilpotent cone, we obtain a generic normal form of the orbits which yields a U-normal form as well, here U is the standard unipotent subgroup. We describe generating (semi-) invariants for the Borel semi-invariant ring as well as for the U-invariant ring. The latter is described in more detail in terms of algebraic quotients by a special toric variety closely related.
