Let p,q,n be natural numbers such that p+q=n. Let \FF be either \CC, the complex numbers field, or \HH, the quaternionic division algebra. We consider the Heisenberg group N(p,q,\FF) defined as N(p,q,\FF)=\FF^{n}\times \mathfrak{Im}\FF, with group law given by (v,\zeta)(v',\zeta')=(v+v', \zeta+\zeta'-{1/2} \mathfrak{Im} B(v,v')), where B(v,w)=\sum_{j=1}^{p} v_{j}\bar{w_{j}} - \sum_{j=p+1}^{n} v_{j}\bar{w_{j}}. Let U(p,q,\FF) be the group of n\times n matrices with coefficients in \FF that leave invariant the form B. In this work we compute explicit fundamental solutions of some second order differential operators on N(p,q,\FF) which are canonically associated to the action of U(p,q,\FF).
