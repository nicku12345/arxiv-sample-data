It is proven that for any representation over a field of characteristic 0 of the non-abelian semidirect product of a cyclic group of prime order p and the group of order 3 the corresponding algebra of polynomial invariants is generated by elements of degree at most p+2. We also determine the exact degree bound for any separating system of the polynomial invariants of any representation of this group in characteristic not dividing 3p.
