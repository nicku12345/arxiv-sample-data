Given a connected reductive group \tilde{G} over a finite field k, and a semisimple k-automorphism \varepsilon of \tilde{G} of finite order, let G denote the connected part of the group of \varepsilon-fixed points. Then there exists a lifting from packets of representations of G(k) to packets for \tilde{G}(k). In the case of Deligne-Lusztig representations, we show that this lifting satisfies a character relation analogous to that of Shintani.
