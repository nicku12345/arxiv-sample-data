We study the homomorphisms between scalar generalized Verma modules. We conjecture that any homomorphism between is composition of elementary homomorphisms. The purpose of this article is to show the conjecture is affirmative for many parabolic subalgebras under the assumption that the infinitesimal characters are regular.
