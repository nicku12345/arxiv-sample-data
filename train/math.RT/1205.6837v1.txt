Let \H_n be the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of the symmetric group S_n, and let Z(\H_n) denote its centre. Let B={b_1,b_2,...,b_t} be a basis for Z(\H_n) over R=\Z[q,q^{-1}]. Then B is called \emph{multiplicative} if, for every i and j, there exists k such that b_ib_j= b_k. In this article we prove that there are no multiplicative bases for Z(\Z S_n) and Z(\H_n) when n\ge 3. In addition, we prove that there exist exactly two multiplicative bases for Z(\Z S_2) and none for Z(\H_2).
