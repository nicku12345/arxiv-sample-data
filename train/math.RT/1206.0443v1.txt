Kottwitz' conjecture is concerned with the intersections of Kazhdan--Lusztig cells with conjugacy classes of involutions in finite Coxeter groups. In joint work with Bonnaf\'e, we have recently found a way to prove this conjecture for groups of type B_n and D_n. The argument for type D_n relies on two ingredients which were used there without proof: (1) a strengthened version of the "branching rule" and (2) the consideration of "\diamond-twisted" involutions where \diamond is a graph automorphism. In this paper we deal with (1), (2) and complete the argument for type D_n; moreover, we establish Kottwitz' conjecture for \diamond-twisted involutions in all cases where \diamond is non-trivial.
