The restriction of a supercuspidal representation of SL_2(k), for k a local nonarchimedean field, to a maximal compact subgroup decomposes as a multiplicity-free direct sum of irreducible representations. We explicitly describe this decomposition in the case that the residual characteristic is odd, and determine how the spectrum of this decomposition varies as a function of the parameters describing the supercuspidal representation.
