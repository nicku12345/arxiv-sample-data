We study the relationship between n-cluster tilting modules over n representation finite algebras and the Euler forms. We show that the dimension vectors of cluster-indecomposable modules give the roots of the Euler form. Moreover, we show that cluster-indecomposable modules are uniquely determined by their dimension vectors. This is a generalization of Gabriel's theorem by cluster tilting theory. We call the above roots cluster-roots and investigate their properties. Furthermore, we provide the description of quivers with relations of n-APR tilts. Using this, we provide a generalization of BGP reflection functors.
