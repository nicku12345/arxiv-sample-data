Let \mathbb{H}^{n} be the (2n+1)-dimensional Heisenberg group, and let K be a compact subgroup of U(n), such that (K,\mathbb{H}^{n}) is a Gelfand pair. Also assume that the K-action on \mathbb{C}^n is polar. We prove a Hecke-Bochner identity associated to the Gelfand pair (K,\mathbb{H}^{n}). For the special case K=U(n), this was proved by Geller, giving a formula for the Weyl transform of a function f of the type f=Pg, where g is a radial function, and P a bigraded solid U(n)-harmonic polynomial. Using our general Hecke-Bochner identity we also characterize (under some conditions) joint eigenfunctions of all differential operators on \mathbb{H}^{n} that are invariant under the action of K and the left action of \mathbb{H}^{n}.
