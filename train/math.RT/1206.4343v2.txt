Recall that the Springer correspondence relates representations of the Weyl group to perverse sheaves on the nilpotent cone. We explain how to extend this to an equivalence between the triangulated category generated by the Springer perverse sheaves and the derived category of differential graded modules over a dg-ring related to the Weyl group.
