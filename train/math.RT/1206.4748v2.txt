Let A = \bigoplus_{i \geqslant 0} A_i be a graded locally finite k-algebra such that A_0 is an arbitrary finite-dimensional algebra satisfying a certain splitting condition. In this paper we develop a generalized Koszul theory preserving many classical results. Moreover, we define a quotient graded algebra \bar{A} = \bigoplus_{i \geqslant 0} \bar{A}_i and show that A is a generalized Koszul algebra if and only if \bar{A} is a classical Koszul algebra and a projective A_0-module. We also describe an application of this theory to the extension algebras of standard modules of standardly stratified algebras.
