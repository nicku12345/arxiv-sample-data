In the last two decades the structure of Extended Affine Lie algebras (EALA) is extensively studied. In explicitly constructing an EALA, the centerless Lie Torus play an important role. In this paper we consider the Universal central extension of a centerless Lie Torus and classify the irreducible integrable modules for them when the center acts non-trivially. They turn out to be "highest weight modules" for direct sum of finitely many affine Lie algebras.
