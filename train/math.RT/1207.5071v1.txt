The purpose of this paper is to prove Duflo's conjecture for (G,\pi, AN) where G is a simple Lie group of Hermitian type and \pi is a discrete series of G and AN is the maximal exponential solvable subgroup for an Iwasawa decomposition G=KAN. This is essentially reduced from the following general theorem we prove in this paper: let G be a connected semisimple Lie group . Then a strongly elliptic G-coadjoint orbit \mathcal{O} is holomorphic if and only if \text{p}(\mathcal{O}) is an open AN-coadjoint orbit, where \text{p} : \mathfrak{g}^* \longrightarrow (\mathfrak{a}\oplus\mathfrak{n})^* is the natural projection.
