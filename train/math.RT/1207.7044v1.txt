Given the nilpotent cone of a complex reductive Lie algebra, we consider its equivariant constructible derived category of sheaves with coefficients in an arbitrary field. This category and its subcategory of perverse sheaves play an important role in Springer theory and the theory of character sheaves. We show that the composition of the Fourier--Sato transform on the Lie algebra followed by restriction to the nilpotent cone restricts to an autoequivalence of the derived category of the nilpotent cone. In the case of GL_n, we show that this autoequivalence can be regarded as a geometric version of Ringel duality for the Schur algebra.
