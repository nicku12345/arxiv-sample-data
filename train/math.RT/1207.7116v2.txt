We classify irreducible representations of the special linear groups in positive characteristic with small weight multiplicities with respect to the group rank and give estimates for the maximal weight multiplicities. For the natural embeddings of the classical groups, inductive systems of representations with totally bounded weight multiplicities are classified. An analogue of the Steinberg tensor product theorem for arbitrary indecomposable inductive systems for such embeddings is proved.
