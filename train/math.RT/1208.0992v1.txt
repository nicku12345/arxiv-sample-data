We give an explicit description of the restriction of discrete series representations of SU(2,1) to a Borel subgroup and to a maximal exponential solvable subgroup and we interpret our results in the framework of orbit method, Hamiltonian geometry and "\text{Spin}_{c}" quantization. Our results give a positive answer to a Duflo's conjecture for SU(2,1).
