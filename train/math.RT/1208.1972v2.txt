Inner ideals of simple locally finite dimensional Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 are described. In particular, it is shown that a simple locally finite dimensional Lie algebra has a non-zero proper inner ideal if and only if it is of diagonal type. Regular inner ideals of diagonal type Lie algebras are characterized in terms of left and right ideals of the enveloping algebra. Regular inner ideals of finitary simple Lie algebras are described.
