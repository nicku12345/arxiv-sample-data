Let  G  be a connected, simply connected semisimple algebraic group over the complex number field, and let  K  be the fixed point subgroup of an involutive automorphism of  G  so that  (G, K)  is a symmetric pair.   We take parabolic subgroups  P  of  G  and  Q  of  K  respectively and consider the product of partial flag varieties  G/P  and  K/Q  with diagonal  K -action, which we call a \emph{double flag variety for symmetric pair}. It is said to be \emph{of finite type} if there are only finitely many  K -orbits on it.   In this paper, we give a parametrization of  K -orbits on  G/P \times K/Q  in terms of quotient spaces of unipotent groups without assuming the finiteness of orbits. If one of  P \subset G  or  Q \subset K  is a Borel subgroup, the finiteness of orbits is closely related to spherical actions. In such cases, we give a complete classification of double flag varieties of finite type, namely, we obtain classifications of  K -spherical flag varieties  G/P  and  G -spherical homogeneous spaces  G/Q .
