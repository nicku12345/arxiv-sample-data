This paper considers Weyl modules for a simple, simply connected algebraic group over an algebraically closed field k of positive characteristic p\not=2. The main result proves, if p\geq 2h-2 (where h is the Coxeter number) and if the Lusztig character formula holds for all (irreducible modules with) regular restricted highest weights, then any Weyl module \Delta(\lambda) has a \Delta^p-filtration, namely, a filtration with sections of the form \Delta^p(\mu_0+p\mu_1):=L(\mu_0)\otimes\Delta(\mu_1)^{[1]}, where \mu_0 is restricted and \mu_1 is arbitrary dominant. In case the highest weight \lambda of the Weyl module \Delta(\lambda) is p-regular, the p-filtration is compatible with the G_1-radical series of the module. The problem of showing that Weyl modules have \Delta^p-filtrations was first proposed as a worthwhile ("w\"unschenswert") problem in Jantzen's 1980 Crelle paper.
