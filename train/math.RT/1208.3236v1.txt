We study the category of Z^l-graded modules with finite-dimensional graded pieces for certain Z+^l-graded Lie algebras. We also consider certain Serre subcategories with finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects. We construct projective resolutions for the simple modules in these categories and compute the Ext groups between simple modules. We show that the projective covers of the simple modules in these Serre subcategories can be regarded as multigraded generalizations of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules and give a recursive formula for computing their graded characters.
