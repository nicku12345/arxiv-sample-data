H. Garland constructed Eisenstein series on affine Kac-Moody groups over the field of real numbers. He established the almost everywhere convergence of these series, obtained a formula for their constant terms, and proved a functional equation for the constant terms. In a subsequent paper, the convergence of the Eisenstein series was obtained. In this paper, we define Eisenstein series on affine Kac-Moody groups over global function fields using an adelic approach. In the course of proving the convergence of these Eisenstein series, we also calculate a formula for the constant terms and prove their convergence and functional equations.
