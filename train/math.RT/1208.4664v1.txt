The smooth hermitian representations of a split reductive p-adic group whose restriction to a maximal hyperspecial compact subgroup contain a single K-type with Iwahori fixed vectors have been studied in [D. Barbasch, A. Moy, Classification of one K-type representations, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 351 (1999), no. 10, 4245-4261] in the more general setting of modules for graded affine Hecke algebras with parameters. We show that every such one K-type module has nonzero Dirac cohomology (in the sense of [D. Barbasch, D. Ciubotaru, P. Trapa, The Dirac operator for graded affine Hecke algebras, arXiv:1006.3822]), and use Dirac operator techniques to determine the semisimple part of the Langlands parameter for these modules, thus completing their classification.
