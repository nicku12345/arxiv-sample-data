We provide criteria for an Auslander-Reiten component having sections of a Krull-Schmidt category to be standard. Specializing to the category of finitely presented representations of a strongly locally finite quiver and its bounded derived category, we obtain many new types of standard Auslander-Reiten components. An application to the module category of a finite-dimensional algebra yields some interesting results.
