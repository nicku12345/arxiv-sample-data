Sometimes a hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra admits an automorphic correction, meaning a generalized Kac-Moody algebra with the same real simple roots and whose denominator function has good automorphic properties; these for example allow one to work out the root multiplicities. Gritsenko and Nikulin have formalized this in their theory of Lorentzian Lie algebras and shown that the real simple roots must satisfy certain conditions in order for the algebra to admit an automorphic correction. We classify the hyperbolic root systems of rank 3 that satisfy their conditions and have only finite many simple roots, or equivalently a timelike Weyl vector. There are 994 of them, with as many as 24 simple roots. Patterns in the data suggest that some of the non-obvious cases may be the richest.
