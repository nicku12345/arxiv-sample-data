We introduce continuous Frobenius categories. These are topological categories which are constructed using representations of the circle over a discrete valuation ring. We show that they are Krull-Schmidt with one indecomposable object for each pair of (not necessarily distinct) points on the circle. By putting restrictions on these points we obtain various Frobenius subcategories. The main purpose of constructing these Frobenius categories is to give a precise and elementary description of the triangulated structure of their stable categories. We show in arXiv:1209.1879 for which parameters these stable categories have cluster structure in the sense of [1] and we call these continuous cluster categories.
