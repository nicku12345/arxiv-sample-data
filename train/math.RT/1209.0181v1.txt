Let k be an algebraically closed field, and let \Lambda\ be an algebra of dihedral type of polynomial growth as classified by Erdmann and Skowro\'{n}ski. We describe all finitely generated \Lambda-modules V whose stable endomorphism rings are isomorphic to k and determine their universal deformation rings R(\Lambda,V). We prove that only three isomorphism types occur for R(\Lambda,V): k, k[[t]]/(t^2) and k[[t]].
