Let \mathcal{K}_n be the so-called wild Kronecker quiver, i.e., a quiver with one source and one sink and n\geq 3 arrows from the source to the sink. The following problems will be studied for an arbitrary regular component \mathcal{C} of the Auslander-Reiten quiver: (1) What is the relationship between dimension vectors and quasi-lengths of the indecomposable regular representations in \mathcal{C}? (2) For a given natural number d, is there an upper bound of the number of indecomposable representations in \mathcal{C} with the same length d? (3) When do the sets of the dimension vectors of indecomposable representations in different regular components coincide?
