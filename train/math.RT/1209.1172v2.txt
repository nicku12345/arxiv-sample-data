Let W be a complex reflection group, acting on a complex vector space H. Kato has recently introduced the notion of a "Kostka system," which is a certain collection of finite-dimensional W-equivariant modules for the symmetric algebra on H. In this paper, we show that Kostka systems can be used to construct "exotic" t-structures on the derived category of finite-dimensional modules, and we prove a derived-equivalence result for these t-structures.
