In this paper we focus on the relations between the derived categories of a Koszul algebra and its Yoneda algebra, in particular we want to consider the cases where these categories are triangularly equivalent. We prove that the simply connected Koszul algebras are derived equivalent to their Yoneda algebras. We consider derived discrete Koszul algebras, and we give necessary and sufficient conditions for these Koszul algebras to be derived equivalent to their Yoneda algebras. Finally, we look at the Koszul algebras such that they are derived equivalent to a hereditary algebra. In the case that the hereditary algebra is tame, we characterize when these algebras are derived equivalent to their Yoneda algebras.
