We give a characterization of indecomposable exceptional modules over finite dimensional gentle algebras. As an application, we study gentle algebras arising from an unpunctured surface and show that a class of indecomposable modules related to curves without selfintersections, as exceptional modules, are uniquely determined by their dimension vectors.
