Let G be the group of F-points of a split connected reductive F-group over a non-Archimedean local field F of characteristic 0. Let \pi be an irreducible smooth self-dual representation of G. The space W of \pi carries a non-degenerate G-invariant bilinear form (\,,\,) which is unique up to scaling. The form is easily seen to be symmetric or skew-symmetric and we set \varepsilon({\pi})=\pm 1 accordingly. In this article, we show that \varepsilon{(\pi)}=1 when \pi is a generic representation of G with non-zero vectors fixed under an Iwahori subgroup I.
