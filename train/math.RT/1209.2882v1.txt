We classify the finite dimensional irreducible representations with integral central character of finite W-algebras U(\mathfrak g,e) associated to standard Levi nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras of types B and C. This classification is given explicitly in terms of the highest weight theory for finite W-algebras.
