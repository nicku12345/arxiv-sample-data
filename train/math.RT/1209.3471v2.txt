In this paper, we study the Green ring (or the representation ring) of Drinfeld quantum double D(H_4) of Sweedler's 4-dimensional Hopf algebra H_4. We first give the decompositions of the tensor products of finite dimensional indecomposable modules into the direct sum of indecomposable modules over D(H_4). Then we describe the structure of the Green ring r(D(H_4)) of D(H_4) and show that r(D(H_4)) is generated, as a ring, by infinitely many elements subject to a family of relations.
