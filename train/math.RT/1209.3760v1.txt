We prove an analogue of Koszul duality for category \mathcal{O} of a reductive group G in positive characteristic \ell larger than 1 plus the number of roots of G. However there are no Koszul rings, and we do not prove an analogue of the Kazhdan--Lusztig conjectures in this context. The main technical result is the formality of the dg-algebra of extensions of parity sheaves on the flag variety if the characteristic of the coefficients is at least the number of roots of G plus 2.
