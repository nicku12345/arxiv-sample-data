In this paper, we study certain ad-nilpotent subalgebras contained in the non-zero graded portion of a simple Z_n-graded Lie algebra. These subalgebras respect the grading on the Lie algebra and are modules for a Borel subalgebra for the grade-zero Lie subalgebra. We show that semisimple elements in such subalgebras lie in the center of the subalgebra, and we provide a classification of these subalgebras whose weight space decompositions have only non-zero weights.
