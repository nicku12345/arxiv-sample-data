If G is a reductive Lie group of Harish-Chandra class, H is a symmetric subgroup, and \pi is a discrete series representation of G, the authors give a condition on the pair (G,H) which guarantees that the direct integral decomposition of \pi|_H contains each irreducible representation of H with finite multiplicity. In addition, if G is a reductive Lie group of Harish-Chandra class, and H\subset G is a closed, reductive subgroup of Harish-Chandra class, the authors show that the multiplicity function in the direct integral decomposition of \pi|_H is constant along `continuous parameters'. In obtaining these results, the authors develop a new technique for studying multiplicities in the restriction \pi|_H via convolution with Harish-Chandra characters. This technique has the advantage of being useful for studying the continuous spectrum as well as the discrete spectrum.
