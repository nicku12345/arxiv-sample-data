We extend the classical Schur-Weyl duality between representations of the groups SL(n,\C) and \sN to the case of SL(n,\C) and the infinite symmetric group \sinf. Our construction is based on a "dynamic," or inductive, scheme of Schur-Weyl dualities. It leads to a new class of representations of the infinite symmetric group, which have not appeared earlier. We describe these representations and, in particular, find their spectral types with respect to the Gelfand-Tsetlin algebra.   The main example of such a representation acts in an incomplete infinite tensor product. As an important application, we consider the weak limit of the so-called Coxeter-Laplace operator, which is essentially the Hamiltonian of the XXX Heisenberg model, in these representations.
