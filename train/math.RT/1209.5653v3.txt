Let \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbb{R}} be a split real, simple Lie algebra with complexification \mathfrak{g}. Let G_{\mathbb{C}} be the connected, simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}, G_{\mathbb{R}} the connected subgroup of G_{\mathbb{C}} with Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbb{R}}, and G a covering group of G_{\mathbb{R}} with a maximal compact subgroup K. A complete classification of "small" K types is derived via Clifford algebras, and an analog, P^{\xi}, of Kostant's P^{\gamma} matrix is defined for a K type {\xi} of principal series admitting a small K type. For the connected, simply connected, split real forms of simple Lie types other than type C_n, a product formula for the determinant of P^{\xi} over the rank one subgroups corresponding to the positive roots is proved. We use these results to determine cyclicity of a small K type of principal series in the closed Langlands chamber and irreducibility of the unitary principal series admitting a small K type.
