By work of De Concini, Kac and Procesi the irreducible representations of the non-restricted specialization of the quantized enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra g at the roots of unity are parametrized by the conjugacy classes of a group G with Lie(G)=g. We show that there is a natural dimension preserving bijection between the sets of irreducible representations associated with conjugacy classes lying in the same Jordan class (decomposition class). We conjecture a relation for representations associated with classes lying in the same sheet of G, providing two alternative formulations. We underline some evidence and illustrate potential consequences.
