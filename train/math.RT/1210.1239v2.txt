These lecture notes are based on an introductory course given by the author at the summer school "Noncommutative Algebraic Geometry" at MSRI in June 2012. The emphasis throughout is on examples to illustrate the many different facets of symplectic reflection algebras. Exercises are included at the end of each lecture in order for the student to get a better feel for these algebras.
