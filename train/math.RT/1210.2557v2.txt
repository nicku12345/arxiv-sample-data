We analyse the recursive formula found for various Ext groups for \SL_2(k), k a field of characteristic p, and derive various generating functions for these groups. We use this to show that the growth rate for the cohomology of \SL_2(k) is at least exponential. In particular, \max \{\dim \Ext^i_{\SL_2(k)}(k, \Delta(a))\mid a,i \in \N \} has (at least) exponential growth for all p. We also show that \max \{\dim \Ext^i_{\SL_2(k)}(k, \Delta(a))\mid a\in \N \} for a fixed i is bounded.
