The representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras of type A at t=0 gives rise, by considering supports, to a natural family of smooth Lagrangian subvarieties of the Calogero-Moser space. The goal of this article is to make precise the relationship between these Lagrangians and Schubert cells in the adelic Grassmannian. In order to do this we show that the isomorphism, as constructed by Etingof and Ginzburg, from the spectrum of the centre of the rational Cherednik algebra to the Calogero-Moser space is compatible with the factorization property of both of these spaces. As a consequence, the space of homomorphisms between certain representations of the rational Cherednik algebra can be identified with functions on the intersection Schubert cells.
