This article is a contribution to a Festschrift for S. Helgason. After a biographical sketch, we survey some of his research on several topics in geometric and harmonic analysis during his long and influential career. While not an exhaustive presentation of all facets of his research, for those topics covered we include reference to the current status of these areas.
