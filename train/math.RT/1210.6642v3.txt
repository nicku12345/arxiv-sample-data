An arbitrary proper parabolic subalgebra {\mathfrak p} of a simple complex Lie algebra {\mathfrak g} induces an embedding {\mathfrak g}\hookrightarrow \mathbb W_n, and more generally an embedding {\mathfrak g}\hookrightarrow \mathbb W_n\otimes \operatorname{End}{} V, where \mathbb W_n is the Weyl algebra in n variables, n is the dimension of the nilradical of {\mathfrak p}, and V is an arbitrary {\mathfrak p}-module. We give an elementary proof of this known fact, report on a computer program computing the embeddings, and tabulate exceptional Lie algebra embeddings G_2 \hookrightarrow \mathbb W_5, F_4 \hookrightarrow \mathbb W_{15}, E_6 \hookrightarrow \mathbb W_{16}, E_7 \hookrightarrow\mathbb W_{27}, E_8 \hookrightarrow \mathbb W_{57} arising in this fashion.
