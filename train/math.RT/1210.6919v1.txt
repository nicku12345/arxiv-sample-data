Let G be a simply connected simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic p>0 with root system R, and let {\mathfrak g}={\cal L}(G) be its restricted Lie algebra. Let V be a finite dimensional {\mathfrak g}-module over K. For any point v\inV, the {\it isotropy subalgebra} of v in \mathfrak g is {\mathfrak g}_v=\{x\in{\mathfrak g}/x\cdot v=0\}. A restricted {\mathfrak g}-module V is called exceptional if for each v\in V the isotropy subalgebra {\mathfrak g}_v contains a non-central element (that is, {\mathfrak g}_v\not\subseteq {\mathfrak z(\mathfrak g)}). This work is devoted to classifying irreducible exceptional \mathfrak g-modules. A necessary condition for a \mathfrak g-module to be exceptional is found and a complete classification of modules over groups of exceptional type is obtained. For modules over groups of classical type, the general problem is reduced to a short list of unclassified modules. The classification of exceptional modules is expected to have applications in modular invariant theory and in classifying modular simple Lie superalgebras.
