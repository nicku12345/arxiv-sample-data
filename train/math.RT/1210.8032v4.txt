Let \ggg=\ggg_\bz+\ggg_\bo be a basic classical Lie superalgebra over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>2, and G be an algebraic supergroup satisfying \Lie(G)=\ggg, with the purely even subgroup G_\ev which is a reductive group. The center \cz:=\cz(\ggg) of the universal enveloping algebra of \ggg easily turns out to be a domain. In this paper, we prove that the quotient field of \cz coincides with that of the subalgebra generated by the G_{\ev}-invariant ring \cz^{G_\ev} of \cz and the p-center \cz_0 of U(\ggg_\bz).
