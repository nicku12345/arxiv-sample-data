We study branching multiplicity spaces of complex classical groups in terms of GL(2) representations. In particular, we show how combinatorics of GL(2) representations are intertwined to make branching rules under the restriction of GL(n) to GL(n-2). We also discuss analogous results for the symplectic and orthogonal groups.
