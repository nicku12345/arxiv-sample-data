Let G be a simple Lie Group with finite center, and let K\subset G be a maximal compact subgroup. We say that G is a Lie group of tube type if G/K is a hermitian symmetric space of tube type. For such a Lie group G, we can find a parabolic subgroup P=MAN, with given Langlands decomposition, such that N is abelian, and N admits a generic character with compact stabilizer. We will call any parabolic subgroup P satisfying this properties a Siegel parabolic.   Let (\pi,V) be an admissible, smooth, Fr\'echet representation of a Lie group of tube type G, and let P \subset G be a Siegel parabolic subgroup. If \chi is a generic character of N, let Wh_{\chi}(V)={\lambda:V \longrightarrow \mathbb{C} | \lambda(\pi(n)v)=\chi(n)v} be the space of Bessel models of V. After describing the classification of all the simple Lie groups of tube type, we will give a characterization of the space of Bessel models of an induced representation. As a corollary of this characterization we obtain a local multiplicity one theorem for the space of Bessel models of an irreducible representation of G.   As an application of this results we calculate the Bessel-Plancherel measure of a Lie group of tube type, L^2(N\backslash G;\chi), where \chi is a generic character of N. Then we use Howe's theory of dual pairs to show that the Plancherel measure of the space L^2(O(p-r,q-s)\backslash O(p,q)) is the pullback, under the \Theta lift, of the Bessel-Plancherel measure L^2(N\backslash Sp(m,\mathbb{R});\chi), where m=r+s and \chi is a generic character that depends on r and s.
