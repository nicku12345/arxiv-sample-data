We give a counterexample to the most optimistic analogue (due to Kleshchev and Ram) of the James conjecture for Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras associated to simply-laced Dynkin diagrams. The first counterexample occurs in type A_5 for p = 2 and involves the same singularity used by Kashiwara and Saito to show the reducibility of the characteristic variety of an intersection cohomology D-module on a quiver variety. Using recent results of Polo one can give counterexamples in type A in all characteristics.
