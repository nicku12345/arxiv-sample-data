For each integral dominant weight \lambda, we construct a twisted global section functor \Gamma^{\lambda} from the category of critical twisted D-modules on affine Grassmannian to the category of \lambda-regular modules of affine Lie algebra at critical level. We proved that \Gamma^{\lambda} is exact and faithful. This generalized the work of Frenkel and Gaitsgory in the case when \lambda=0.
