These are lecture notes for a one semester introductory course I gave at Indiana University. The goal was to make this exposition as clear and elementary as possible. A particular emphasis is given on examples involving SU(1,1). These notes are in part based on lectures given by my graduate advisor Wilfried Schmid at Harvard University and PQR2003 Euroschool in Brussels as well as other sources.
