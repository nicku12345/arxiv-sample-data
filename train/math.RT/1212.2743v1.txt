In part I we introduced the class {\mathcal E}_2 of Lie subgroups of Sp(2,\R) and obtained a classification up to conjugation (Theorem 1.1). Here, we determine for which of these groups the restriction of the metaplectic representation gives rise to a reproducing formula. In all the positive cases we characterize the admissible vectors with a generalized Calder\'on equation. They include products of 1D-wavelets, directional wavelets, shearlets, and many new examples.
