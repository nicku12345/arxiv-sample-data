Let C be a one- or two-sided Kazhdan--Lusztig cell in a Coxeter group (W,S), and let Reduced(C) denote the set of reduced expressions of all w in C, regarded as a language over the alphabet S. Casselman has conjectured that Reduced(C) is regular. In this paper we give a conjectural description of the cells when W is the group corresponding to a hyperbolic polygon, and show that our conjectures imply Casselman's.
