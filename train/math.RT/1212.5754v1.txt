Let \k be an algebraically closed field, let \A be a finite dimensional \k-algebra and let V be a \A-module with stable endomorphism ring isomorphic to \k. If \A is self-injective then V has a universal deformation ring R(\A,V), which is a complete local commutative Noetherian \k-algebra with residue field \k. Moreover, if \Lambda is also a Frobenius \k-algebra then R(\A,V) is stable under syzygies. We use these facts to determine the universal deformation rings of string \Ar-modules whose stable endomorphism ring isomorphic to \k, where \Ar is a symmetric special biserial \k-algebra that has quiver with relations depending on the four parameters  \bar{r}=(r_0,r_1,r_2,k) with r_0,r_1,r_2\geq 2 and k\geq 1.
