Let G_1,G_2 be real reductive groups and (\pi,V) a smooth, irreducible, admissible representation of G_1 \times G_2. We prove that (\pi,V) is the completed tensor product of (\pi_i,V_i), i=1,2, where (\pi_i,V_i) is a smooth,irreducible,admissible representation of G_i, i=1,2. We deduce this from the analogous theorem for Harish-Chandra modules, for which one direction was proven in [AG] and the other direction we prove here.   As a corollary, we deduce that strong Gelfand property for a pair H \subset G of real reductive groups is equivalent to the usual Gelfand property of the pair \Delta H \subset G \times H.
