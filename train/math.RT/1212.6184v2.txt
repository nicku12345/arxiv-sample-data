The aim of this paper is twofold. On one hand, we prove a slight generalization of the stability for Gorenstein categories in [SWSW] and [Huang]; and show that the relative Auslander algebra of a CM-finite algebra is CM-free. On the other hand, we describe the bounded derived category, and the Gorenstein defect category introduced in [BJO], via Gorenstein-projective objects; and we show that the Gorenstein defect category of a CM-finite algebra is triangle-equivalent to the singularity category of its relative Auslander algebra.
