A general framework of constructions of endoscopy correspondences via automorphic integral transforms for classical groups is formulated in terms of the Arthur classification of the discrete spectrum of square-integrable automorphic forms. This suggests a principle, which is called the (\tau,b)-theory of automorphic forms of classical groups, to reorganize and extend the series of work of Piatetski-Shapiro, Rallis, Kudla and others on standard L-functions of classical groups and theta correspondence.
