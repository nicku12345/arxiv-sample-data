We develop a reduction procedure which provides an equivalence (as highest weight categories) from an arbitrary block (defined in terms of the central character and the integral Weyl group) of the BGG category O for a general linear Lie superalgebra to an integral block of O for (possibly a direct sum of) general linear Lie superalgebras. We also establish indecomposability of blocks of O.
