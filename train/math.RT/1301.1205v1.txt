We construct combinatorial (involutory) Gelfand models for the following diagram algebras in the case when they are semi-simple: Brauer algebra, its partial analogue, walled Brauer algebra, its partial analogue, Temperley-Lieb algebra, its partial analogue, walled Temperley-Lieb algebra, its partial analogue, partition algebra and its Temperley-Lieb analogue.
