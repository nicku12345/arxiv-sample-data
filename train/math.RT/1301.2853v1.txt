For a quiver Q, a k-algebra A, and a full subcategory \mathcal X of A-mod, the monomorphism category {\rm Mon}(Q, \mathcal X) is introduced. The main result says that if T is an A-module such that there is an exact sequence 0\rightarrow T_m\rightarrow...\rightarrow T_0\rightarrow D(A_A)\rightarrow 0 with each T_i\in {\rm add} (T), then {\rm Mon}(Q, \ ^\perp T) = \ ^\perp (kQ\otimes_k T); and if T is cotilting, then kQ\otimes_k T is a unique cotilting \m-module, up to multiplicities of indecomposable direct summands, such that {\rm Mon}(Q, \ ^\perp T)= \ ^\perp (kQ \otimes_k T).   As applications, the category of the Gorenstein-projective (kQ\otimes_kA)-modules is characterized as {\rm Mon}(Q, \mathcal{GP}(A)) if A is Gorenstein; the contravariantly finiteness of {\rm Mon}(Q, \mathcal X) can be described; and a sufficient and necessary condition for {\rm Mon}(Q, A) being of finite type is given.
