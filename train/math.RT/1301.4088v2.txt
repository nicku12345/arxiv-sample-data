We give a survey on the theory of representation-finite and certain minimal representation-infinite algebras.The main goals are the existence of multiplicative bases and of coverings with good properties. Both are attained via ray-categories. As applications we include a proof of a sharper version of the second Brauer-Thrall conjecture and of the fact that there are no gaps in the lengths of the indecomposable modules over an algebra.
