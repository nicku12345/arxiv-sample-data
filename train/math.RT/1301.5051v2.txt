In this paper, we study the Plancherel measure of a class of non-connected nilpotent groups which is of special interest in Gabor theory. Let G be a time-frequency group. More precisely, that is G=\left\langle T_{k},M_{l}:k\in\mathbb{Z}^{d},l\in B\mathbb{Z}^{d}\right\rangle , T_{k}, M_{l} are translations and modulations operators acting in L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), and B is a non-singular matrix. We compute the Plancherel measure of the left regular representation of G\ which is denoted by L. The action of G on L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) induces a representation which we call a Gabor representation. Motivated by the admissibility of this representation, we compute the decomposition of L into direct integral of irreducible representations by providing a precise description of the unitary dual and its Plancherel measure. As a result, we generalize Hartmut F\"uhr's results which are only obtained for the restricted case where d=1, B=1/L,L\in\mathbb{Z} and L>1. Even in the case where G is not type I, we are able to obtain a decomposition of the left regular representation of G into a direct integral decomposition of irreducible representations when d=1. Some interesting applications to Gabor theory are given as well. For example, when B is an integral matrix, we are able to obtain a direct integral decomposition of the Gabor representation of G.
