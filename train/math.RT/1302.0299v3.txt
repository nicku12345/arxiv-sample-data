We use the twisted topological trace formula developed in an earlier paper to understand liftings from symplectic to general linear groups. We analyse the lift from \SP_{2g} to \PGL_{2g+1} over the ground field \Q in further detail, and we get a description of the image of this lift for the L^2 cohomology of \SP_{2g} (which is related to the intersection cohomology of the Shimura variety attached to \GSp_{2g}) in terms of the Eisenstein cohomology of the general linear group, whose building constituents are cuspidal representations of Levi groups. This description may be used to understand endoscopic and CAP-representations of the symplectic group.
