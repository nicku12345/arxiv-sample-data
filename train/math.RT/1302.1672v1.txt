Let G be a p-adic reductive group, and R an algebraically closed field. Let us consider a smooth representation of G on an R-vector space V. Fix an open compact subgroup K of G and a smooth irreducible representation of K on a finite-dimensional R-vector space W. The space of K-homomorphisms from W to V is a right module over the intertwining algebra H(G,K,W). We examine how those constructions behave when we pass to the contragredient representations of V and W, and we give conditions under which the behaviour is the same as in the case of complex representations. We take an abstract viewpoint and use only general properties of G. In the last section, we apply this to the theory of types for the group GL(n) and its inner forms over a non-Archimedean local field.
