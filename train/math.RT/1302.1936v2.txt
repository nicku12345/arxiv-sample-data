In this survey article we give a brief account of constructions and results concerning the quivers with potentials associated to triangulations of surfaces with marked points. Besides the fact that the mutations of these quivers with potentials are compatible with the flips of triangulations, we mention some recent results on the representation type of Jacobian algebras and the uniqueness of non-degenerate potentials. We also mention how the the quivers with potentials associated to triangulations give rise to CY2 and CY3 triangulated categories that have turned out to be useful in the subject of stability conditions and in theoretical physics.
