The class of support \tau-tilting modules was introduced recently by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten. These modules complete the class of tilting modules from the point of view of mutations. Given a finite dimensional algebra A, we study all basic support \tau-tilting A-modules which have given basic \tau-rigid A-module as a direct summand. We show that there exist an algebra C such that there exists an order-preserving bijection between these modules and all basic support \tau-tilting C-modules; we call this process \tau-tilting reduction. An important step in this process is the formation of \tau-perpendicular categories which are analogs of ordinary perpendicular categories. Finally, we show that \tau-tilting reduction is compatible with silting reduction and 2-Calabi-Yau reduction in appropiate triangulated categories.
