Let (G,\tilde{G}) be a reductive dual pair over a local field {\Fontauri k} of characteristic 0, and denote by V and \tilde{V} the standard modules of G and \tilde{G}, respectively. Consider the set Max Hom(V,\tilde{V}) of full rank elements in Hom(V,\tilde{V}), and the nilpotent orbit correspondence \mathcal{O} \subset \mathfrak{g} and \Theta (\mathcal{O})\subset \tilde{\mathfrak{g}} induced by elements of Max Hom(V,\tilde{V}) via the moment maps. Let (\pi,\mathscr{V}) be a smooth irreducible representation of G. We show that there is a correspondence of the generalized Whittaker models of \pi  of type \mathcal{O} and of \Theta (\pi) of type \Theta (\mathcal{O}), where \Theta (\pi) is the full theta lift of \pi . When (G,\tilde{G}) is in the stable range with G the smaller member, every nilpotent orbit \mathcal{O} \subset \mathfrak{g} is in the image of the moment map from Max Hom (V,\tilde{V}). In this case, and for {\Fontauri k} non-Archimedean, the result has been previously obtained by M\oe{}glin in a different approach.
