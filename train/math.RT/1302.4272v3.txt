A new basis of the q-Brauer algebra is introduced, which is a lift of Murphy bases of Hecke algebras of symmetric groups. This basis is a cellular basis in the sense of Graham and Lehrer. Subsequently, using combinatorial language we prove that the non-isomorphic simple q-Brauer modules are indexed by the e(q^2)-restricted partitions of n-2k where k is an integer, 0 \le k \le [n/2]. When the q-Brauer algebra has low-dimension a criterion of semisimplicity is given, which is used to show that the q-Brauer algebra is in general not isomorphic to the BMW-algebra.}
