Let G/H be a hyperbolic space over R C or H, and let K be a maximal compact subgroup of G. Let D denote a certain explicit invariant differential operator, such that the non-cuspidal discrete series belong to the kernel of D. For any L^2-Schwartz function f on G/H, we prove that the Abel transform A(Df) of Df is a Schwartz function. This is an extension of a result established in [2] for K-finite and K\cap H-invariant functions.
