This paper continues the study of the poset of eigenspaces of elements of a unitary reflection group (for a fixed eigenvalue), which was commenced in [6] and [5]. The emphasis in this paper is on the representation theory of unitary reflection groups. The main tool is the theory of poset extensions due to Segev and Webb ([16]). The new results place the well-known representations of unitary reflection groups on the top homology of the lattice of intersections of hyperplanes into a natural family, parameterised by eigenvalue.
