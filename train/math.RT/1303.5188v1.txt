We determine explicitly the Gauss sums on the general linear group GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^l\mathbb{Z}) for all irreducible characters, where p is an odd prime and l is an integer > 1. While there are several studies of the Gauss sums on finite algebraic groups defined over a finite field, this paper seems to be the first one which determines the Gauss sums on a matrix group over a finite ring.
