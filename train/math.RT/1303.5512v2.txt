Let X = \bigcup_k X_k be the ind-Grassmannian of codimension n subspaces of an infinite-dimensional torus representation. If \cE is a bundle on X, we expect that \sum_j (-1)^j \Lambda^j(\cE) represents the K-theoretic fundamental class [\cO_Y] of a subvariety Y \subset X dual to \cE^*. It is desirable to lift a K-theoretic "projection formula" from the finite-dimensional subvarieties X_k, but such a statement requires switching the order of the limits in j and k. We find conditions in which this may be done, and consider examples in which Y is the Hilbert scheme of points in the plane, the Hilbert scheme of an irreducible curve singularity, and the affine Grassmannian of SL(2,\C). In the last example, the projection formula becomes an instance of the Weyl-Ka\c{c} character formula, which has long been recognized as the result of formally extending Borel-Weil theory and localization to Y \cite{S}. See also \cite{C3} for a proof of the MacDonald inner product formula of type A_n along these lines.
