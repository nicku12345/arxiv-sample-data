We describe the relation between G-character varieties, X_G(\Gamma), and G/H-character varieties, where H is a finite, central subgroup of G. In particular, we find finite generating sets of coordinate rings C[X_{G/H}(\Gamma)] for classical groups G and H as above. Using this approach we find an explicit description of C[X_{SO(4,C)}(F_2)] for the free group on two generators, F_2.   In the second part of the paper, we prove several properties of SO(2n,C)-character varieties. This is a particularly interesting class of character varieties because unlike for all other classical groups G, the coordinate rings C[X_{G}(\Gamma)] are generally not generated by trace functions \tau_\gamma, for \gamma\in \Gamma, for G=SO(2n,C). In fact, we prove that the coordinate ring C[X_{SO(2n,C)}(\Gamma)] is not even generated by "generalized trace functions," \tau_{\gamma,V}, for all \gamma\in \Gamma and all representations V of SO(2n,C) for n=2 and groups \Gamma of corank \geq 2.
