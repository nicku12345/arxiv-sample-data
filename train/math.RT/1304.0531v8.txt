We prove a category equivalence between algebraic supergroups and Harish-Chandra pairs over a commutative ring which is 2-torsion free. The result is applied to re-construct the Chevalley \mathbb{Z}-supergroups constructed by Fioresi and Gavarini [8] and by Gavarini [9, 10]. For a wide class of algebraic supergroups we describe their representations by using their super-hyperalgebras.
