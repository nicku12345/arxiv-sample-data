K. Igusa and G. Todorov introduced two functions \phi and \psi, which are natural and important homological measures generalising the notion of the projective dimension. These Igusa-Todorov functions have become into a powerful tool to understand better the finitistic dimension conjecture.   In this paper, for an artin R-algebra A and the Igusa-Todorov function \phi, we characterise the \phi-dimension of A in terms either of the bi-functors \mathrm{Ext}^{i}_{A}(-, -) or Tor's bi-functors \mathrm{Tor}^{A}_{i}(-,-). Furthermore, by using the first characterisation of the \phi-dimension, we show that the finiteness of the \phi-dimension of an artin algebra is invariant under derived equivalences. As an application of this result, we generalise the classical Bongartz's result as follows: For an artin algebra A, a tilting A-module T and the endomorphism algebra B=\mathrm{End}_A(T)^{op}, we have that \mathrm{Fidim}\,(A)-\mathrm{pd}\,T\leq \mathrm{Fidim}\,(B)\leq \mathrm{Fidim}\,(A)+\mathrm{pd}\,T.
