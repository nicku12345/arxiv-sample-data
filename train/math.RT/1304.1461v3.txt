Let G be a semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field k of positive characteristic p. Under some restrictions on the size of p, the present paper establishes new results on the G-module structure of \Ext^\bullet_{G_1}(V,W) when V,W belong to several important classes of rational G-modules, and G_1 denotes the first Frobenius kernel of G. For example, it is proved that, if L,L' are (p-regular) irreducible G_1-modules, then \Ext^n_{G_1}(L,L')^{[-1]} has a good filtration with computable multiplicities. This and many other results depend on the entirely new technique of using methods of what we call forced gradings in the representation theory of G, as developed by the authors in recent papers, and extended here.   In addition to providing proofs, these methods lead effectively to a new conceptual framework for the study of rational G-modules, and, in this context, to the introduction of a new class of graded finite dimensional algebras, which we call Q-Koszul algebras. These algebras are similar to Koszul algebras, but are quasi-hereditary, rather than semisimple, in grade 0.
