Finite-dimensional subalgebras of a Lie algebra of smooth vector fields on a circle, as well as piecewise-smooth global transformations of a circle on itself, are considered. A canonical forms of realizations of two- and three-dimensional noncommutative algebras are obtained. It is shown that all other realizations of smooth vector fields are reduced to this form using global transformations. Some combinatorial formulas for the number of inequivalent realizations of these algebras are obtained.
