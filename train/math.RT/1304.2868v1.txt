We consider the spherical complementary series of rank one Lie groups H_n=\SO_0(n, 1; \mathbb F) for \mathbb F=\mathbb R, \mathbb C, \mathbb H. We prove that there exist finitely many discrete components in its restriction under the subgroup H_{n-1}=\SO_0(n-1, 1; \mathbb F). This is proved by imbedding the complementary series into analytic continuation of holomorphic discrete series of G_n=SU(n, 1), SU(n, 1)\times SU(n, 1) and SU(2n, 2) and by the branching of holomorphic representations under the corresponding subgroup   G_{n-1}.
