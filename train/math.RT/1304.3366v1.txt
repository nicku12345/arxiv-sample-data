Given a finite group G and a subgroup K, we study the commutant of \text{Ind}_K^G\theta, where \theta is an irreducible K-representation. After a careful analysis of Frobenius reciprocity, we are able to introduce an orthogonal basis in such commutant and an associated Fourier transform. Then we translate our results in the corresponding Hecke algebra, an isomorphic algebra in the group algebra of G. Again a complete Fourier analysis is developed and, as particular cases, we obtain some results of Curtis and Fossum on the irreducible characters of Hecke algebras. Finally, we develop a theory of Gelfand-Tsetlin bases for Hecke algebras.
