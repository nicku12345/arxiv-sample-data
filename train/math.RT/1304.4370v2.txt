Let q be a prime power, G=GL_n(q) and let U\leqslant G be the subgroup of (lower) unitriangular matrices in G. For a partition \lambda of n denote the corresponding unipotent Specht module over the complex field \C for G by S^\lambda. It is conjectured that for c\in \Z_{\geqslant 0} the number of irreducible constituents of dimension q^c of the restriction \RRes^{G}_U(S^\lambda) of S^\lambda to U is a polynomial in q with integer coefficients depending only on c and \lambda, not on q. In the special case of the partition \lambda=(1^n) this implies a longstanding (still open) conjecture of Higman \cite{higman}, stating that the number of conjugacy classes of U should be a polynomial in q with integer coefficients depending only on n not on q. In this paper we prove the conjecture in the case that \lambda=(n-m,m) (0\leqslant m \leqslant n/2) is a 2-part partition. As a consequence, we obtain a new representation theoretic construction of the standard basis of S^\lambda (over fields of characteristic coprime to q) defined by M. Brandt, R. Dipper, G. James and S. Lyle in \cite{brandt2}, \cite{dj1} and an explanation of the rank polynomials appearing there.
