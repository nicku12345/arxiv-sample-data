Let \Gamma and \Lambda be artin algebras such that \Gamma is a split-by-nilpotent extension of \Lambda by a two sided ideal I of \Gamma. Consider the so-called change of rings functors G:={}_\Gamma\Gamma_\Lambda\otimes_\Lambda - and F:={}_\Lambda \Lambda_\Gamma\otimes_\Gamma -. In this paper, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a stratifying system (\Theta,\leq) in \modu\Lambda can be lifted to a stratifying system (G\Theta,\leq) in \modu\,(\Gamma). Furthermore, by using the functors F and G, we study the relationship between their filtered categories of modules and some connections with their corresponding standardly stratified algebras are stated. Finally, a sufficient condition is given for stratifying systems in \modu\,(\Gamma) in such a way that they can be restricted, through the functor F, to stratifying systems in \modu\,(\Lambda).
