An n-Lie superalgebra of parity 0 is called a first-class n-Lie superalgebra. In this paper, we give the representation and cohomology for a first-class n-Lie superalgebra and obtain a relation between extensions of a first-class n-Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{b} by an abelian one \mathfrak{a} and Z^1(\mathfrak{b}, \mathfrak{a})_{\bar{0}}. We also introduce the notion of T^*-extensions of first-class n-Lie superalgebras and prove that every finite-dimensional nilpotent metric first-class n-Lie superalgebra (\g,< ,>_{\g}) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic not 2 is isometric to a suitable T^*-extension.
