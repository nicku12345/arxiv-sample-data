Let g' and g be isomorphic to any two of the Lie algebras gl(infty), sl(infty), sp(infty), and so(infty). Let M be a simple tensor g-module. We introduce the notion of an embedding of g' into g of general tensor type and derive branching laws for triples g', g, and M, where the embedding of g' into g is of general tensor type. More precisely, since M is in general not semisimple as a g'-module, we determine the socle filtration of M over g'. Due to the description of embeddings of classical locally finite Lie algebras given by Dimitrov and Penkov, our results hold for all possible embeddings of g' into g unless g' is isomorphic to gl(infty).
