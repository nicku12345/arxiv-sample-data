For the Lie algebras g_n= \mathfrak{o}_{2n+1},\mathfrak{sp}_{2n},\mathfrak{o}_{2n} a simple construction of a base in an irreducible representation is given. The construction of this base uses the method of Z-invariants of Zhelobenko and the technique of Wigner coefficients, which was applied by Biedenharn and Baird to the construction of a Gelfand-Tsetlin base in the case \mathfrak{gl}_n. A relation between matrix elements and Wigner coefficients for g_n and analogous objects for \mathfrak{gl}_{n+1} is established.
