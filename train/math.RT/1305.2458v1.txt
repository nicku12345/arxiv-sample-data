The classical Erd{\" o}s-Turan Inequality bounds how far a sequence of points in the circle is from being equidistributed in terms of its exponential moments. We prove an analogous inequality for all compact simply-connected semisimple Lie groups, bounding how far a sequence is from being equidistributed in the conjugacy classes of the group in terms of the moments of irreducible characters.
