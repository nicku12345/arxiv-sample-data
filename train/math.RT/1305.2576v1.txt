Simple-minded systems of objects in a stable module category are defined by common properties with the set of simple modules, whose images under stable equivalences do form simple-minded systems. Over a representation-finite self-injective algebra, it is shown that all simple-minded systems are images of simple modules under stable equivalences of Morita type, and that all simple-minded systems can be lifted to Nakayama-stable simple-minded collections in the derived category. In particular, all simple-minded systems can be obtained algorithmically using mutations.
