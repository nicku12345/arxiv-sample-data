Let F be a non-archimedean local field. We establish the local Langlands correspondence for all inner forms of the group SL_n (F). It takes the form of a bijection between, on the one hand, conjugacy classes of Langlands parameters for SL_n (F) enhanced with an irreducible representation of an S-group and, on the other hand, the union of the spaces of irreducible admissible representations of all inner forms of SL_n (F). An analogous result is shown in the archimedean case.   To settle the case where F has positive characteristic, we employ the method of close fields. We prove that this method is compatible with the local Langlands correspondence for inner forms of GL_n (F), when the fields are close enough compared to the depth of the representations.
