Let k be an algebraically closed field and A a finite-dimensional k-algebra. Given an A-module M, the set G_e(M) of all submodules of M with dimension vector e is called a quiver Grassmannian. If D,Y are A-modules, then we consider Hom(D,Y) as a B-module, where B is the opposite of the endomorphism ring of D, and the Auslander varieties for A are the quiver Grassmannians of the form G_e Hom(D,Y). Quiver Grassmannians, thus also Auslander varieties are projective varieties and it is known that every projective variety occurs in this way. There is a tendency to relate this fact to the wildness of quiver representations and the aim of this note is to clarify these thoughts: We show that for an algebra A which is (controlled) wild, any projective variety can be realized as an Auslander variety, but not necessarily as a quiver Grassmannian.
