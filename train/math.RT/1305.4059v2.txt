In this paper we construct a class of new irreducible modules over untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebras \widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}, generalizing and including both highest weight modules and Whittaker modules. These modules allow us to obtain a complete classification of irreducible \widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}-modules on which the action of each root vector in \widetilde{\mathfrak{n}}_+ is locally finite, where \widetilde{\mathfrak{n}}_+ is the locally nilpotent subalgebra (or positive part) of \widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}. The necessary and sufficient conditions for two such irreducible \widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}-modules to be isomorphic are also determined. In the second part of the paper, we use the "shifting technique" to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the tensor product of irreducible integrable loop \widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}-modules and irreducible integrable highest weight \widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}-modules to be simple. This tensor product problem was originally studied by Chari and Pressley 28 years ago.
