For k = 1, 2,...,n-1 let V_k = V(\lambda_k) be the Weyl module for the special orthogonal group G = \mathrm{SO}(2n+1,\F) with respect to the k-th fundamental dominant weight \lambda_k of the root system of type B_n and put V_n = V(2\lambda_n). It is well known that all of these modules are irreducible when \mathrm{char}(\F) \neq 2 while when \mathrm{char}(\F) = 2 they admit many proper submodules. In this paper, assuming that \mathrm{char}(\F) = 2, we prove that V_k admits a chain of submodules V_k = M_k \supset M_{k-1}\supset ... \supset M_1\supset M_0 \supset M_{-1} = 0 where M_i \cong V_i for 1,..., k-1 and M_0 is the trivial 1-dimensional module. We also show that for i = 1, 2,..., k the quotient M_i/M_{i-2} is isomorphic to the so called i-th Grassmann module for G. Resting on this fact we can give a geometric description of M_{i-1}/M_{i-2} as a submodule of the i-th Grassmann module. When \F is perfect G\cong \mathrm{Sp}(2n,\F) and M_i/M_{i-1} is isomorphic to the Weyl module for \mathrm{Sp}(2n,\F) relative to the i-th fundamental dominant weight of the root system of type C_n. All irreducible sections of the latter modules are known. Thus, when \F is perfect, all irreducible sections of V_k are known as well.
