We prove an asymptotic version of a conjecture by Varagnolo and Vasserot on an equivalence between the category O for a cyclotomic Rational Cherednik algebra and a suitable truncation of an affine parabolic category O. We prove an asymptotic version of a conjecture by Varagnolo and Vasserot on an equivalence between the category O for a cyclotomic Rational Cherednik algebra and a suitable truncation of an affine parabolic category O that, in particular, implies Rouquier's conjecture on the decomposition numbers in the former. Our proof uses two ingredients: an extension of Rouquier's deformation approach as well as categorical actions on highest weight categories and related combinatorics.
