An abelian extension of the special orthogonal Lie algebra D_n is a nonsemisimple Lie algebra D_n \inplus V, where V is a finite-dimensional representation of D_n, with the understanding that [V,V]=0. We determine all abelian extensions of D_n that may be embedded into the exceptional Lie algebra E_{n+1}, n=5, 6, and 7. We then classify these embeddings, up to inner automorphism. As an application, we also consider the restrictions of irreducible representations of E_{n+1} to D_n \inplus V, and discuss which of these restrictions are or are not indecomposable.
