Let \fg be a symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebra with the standard Cartan subalgebra \fh and the Weyl group W. Let P_+ be the set of dominant integral weights. For \lambda \in P_+, let L(\lambda) be the irreducible, integrable, highest weight representation of \fg with highest weight \lambda. For a positive integer s, define the {\em saturated tensor semigroup} as \begin{align*} \Gamma_s:= \{(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_s,\mu)\in P_+^{s+1}: \exists\, N>1 \,\,\text{with}\,\, L(N\mu)\subset L(N\lambda_1)\otimes \dots \otimes L(N\lambda_s)\}. \end{align*} The aim of this paper is to begin a systematic study of \Gamma_s in the infinite dimensional symmetrizable Kac-Moody case. In this paper, we produce a set of necessary inequalities satisfied by \Gamma_s. We further prove that any integer d>0 is a saturation factor for A^{(1)}_1 and 4 is a saturation factor for A^{(2)}_2.
