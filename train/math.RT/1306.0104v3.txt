Let \frak F_{\l} be the space of tensor densities of degree \lambda on the supercircle S^{1|1}. We consider the space \mathfrak{D}_{\lambda,\mu}^k of k-th order linear differential operators from \frak F_{\l} to \frak F_{\mu} as \mathfrak{osp}(1|2)-module and we determine the space \mathfrak{I}_{\lambda,\mu}^k of linear maps on \mathfrak{D}_{\lambda,\mu}^k commuting with the \mathfrak{osp}(1|2)-action.
