In this article we classify all infinitesimal Hecke algebras of so_N. We establish isomorphism of their universal versions and the W-algebras of so_{N+2m+1} with a 1-block nilpotent element of the Jordan type (1,...,1,2m+1). This should be considered as a continuation of the recent joint paper with I. Losev, where the analogous results were obtained for the cases of gl_n and sp_{2n}.
