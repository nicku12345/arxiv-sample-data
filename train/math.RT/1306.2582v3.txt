Let \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g}_{\overline{0}} \oplus \mathfrak{g}_{\overline{1}} be a Lie superalgebra over an algebraically closed field, k, of characteristic 0. An endotrivial \mathfrak{g}-module, M, is a \mathfrak{g}-supermodule such that \operatorname{Hom}_k(M,M) \cong k_{ev} \oplus P as \mathfrak{g}-supermodules, where k_{ev} is the trivial module concentrated in degree \overline{0} and P is a projective \mathfrak{g}-supermodule. In the stable module category, these modules form a group under the operation of the tensor product. We show that for an endotrivial module M, the syzygies \Omega^n(M) are also endotrivial, and for certain Lie superalgebras of particular interest, we show that \Omega^1(k_{ev}) and the parity change functor actually generate the group of endotrivials. Additionally, for a broader class of Lie superalgebras, for a fixed n, we show that there are finitely many endotrivial modules of dimension n.
