Let (W,S) be any Coxeter system and let w \mapsto w^* be an involution of W which preserves the set of simple generators S. Lusztig and Vogan have shown that the corresponding set of twisted involutions (i.e., elements w \in W with w^{-1} = w^*) naturally generates a module of the Hecke algebra of (W,S) with two distinguished bases. The transition matrix between these bases defines a family of polynomials P^\sigma_{y,w} which one can view as a "twisted" analogue of the much-studied family of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of (W,S). The polynomials P^\sigma_{y,w} can have negative coefficients, but display several conjectural positivity properties of interest, which parallel positivity properties of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. This paper reports on some calculations which verify four such positivity conjectures in several finite cases of interest, in particular for the non-crystallographic Coxeter systems of types H_3 and H_4.
