We classify blocks of categories of weight and generalized weight modules of algebras of twisted differential operators on P^n. Necessary and sufficient conditions for these blocks to be tame and proofs that some of the blocks are Koszul are provided. We also establish equivalences of categories between these blocks and categories of bounded and generalized bounded weight sl(n+1)-modules in the cases of nonintegral and singular central character.
