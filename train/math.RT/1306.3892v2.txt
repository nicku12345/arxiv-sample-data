We generalize the geometric construction of quiver Hecke algebras from Varagnolo and Vasserot to a setup with arbitrary connected reductive groups. This corresponds to replacing quiver representations by generalized quiver representations introduced by Derksen and Weyman. The class of algebras which we construct contains (affine) nil Hecke algebras, skew group rings of Weyl groups with polynomial rings and quiver Hecke algebras. We describe an explicit faithful representation in a polynomial ring and we calculate the generators and relations for these algebras.
