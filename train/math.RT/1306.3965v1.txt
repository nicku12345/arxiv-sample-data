We describe of all finite dimensional uniserial representations of a commutative associative (resp. abelian Lie) algebra over a perfect (resp. sufficiently large perfect) field. In the Lie case the size of the field depends on the answer to following question, considered and solved in this paper. Let K/F be a finite separable field extension and let x,y\in K. When is F[x,y]=F[\alpha x+\beta y] for some non-zero elements \alpha,\beta\in F?
