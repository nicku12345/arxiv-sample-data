Let F be an arbitrary field and let f:V\times V\to F be a non-degenerate symmetric or alternating bilinear form defined on an F-vector space of finite dimension m\geq 2. Let L(f) be the subalgebra of gl(V) formed by all skew-adjoint endomorphisms with respect to f. We find a composition series for the L(f)-module gl(V) and furnish multiple identifications for all its composition factors.
