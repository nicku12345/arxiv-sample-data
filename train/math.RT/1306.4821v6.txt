A type of directed multigraph called a W-digraph is introduced to model the structure of certain representations of Hecke algebras, including those constructed by Lusztig and Vogan from involutions in a Weyl group. Building on results of Lusztig, a complete characterization of W-digraphs is given in terms of subdigraphs for dihedral parabolic subgroups. Graph-theoretic properties of W-digraphs are established including, under certain assumptions, acyclicity. In case the Coxeter system is finite, a bound on the number of vertices of a connected W-digraph is obtained, and a graph-theoretic version of the usual duality operation is obtained.
