We introduce a handy construction of cluster algebras of type \mathbb{A}_{\infty}, we give a complete classification of the cluster algebras arising from the infinity-gon, and finally we construct the category of the diagonals of the infinity-gon and show that it is triangle-equivalent to the infinite cluster category of type \mathbb{A}_{\infty} described by Holm and J{\o}rgensen.
