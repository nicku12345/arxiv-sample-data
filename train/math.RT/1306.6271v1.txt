We prove the existence of Hall polynomials for prinjective representations of finite partially ordered sets of finite prinjective type. In Section 4 we shortly discuss consequences of the existence of Hall polynomials, in particular, we are able to define a generic Ringel-Hall algebra for prinjective representations of posets of finite prinjective type.
