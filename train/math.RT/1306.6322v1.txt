We construct a special embedding of the translation quiver \mathbb{Z}Q in the three-dimensional affine space \mathbb{R}^{3} where Q is a finite connected acyclic quiver and \mathbb{Z}Q contains a local slice whose quiver is isomorphic to the opposite quiver Q^{op} of Q. Via this embedding, we show that there exists an involutive anti-automorphism of the translation quiver \mathbb{Z}Q. As an immediate consequence, we characterize explicitly the group of cluster automorphisms of the cluster algebras of seed (X,Q), where Q and Q^{op} are mutation equivalent.
