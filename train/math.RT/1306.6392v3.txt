In a recent paper we found conditions for a nilpotent Lie group to be foliated into subgroups that have square integrable unitary representations that fit together to form a filtration by normal subgroups. That resulted in explicit character formulae, Plancherel formulae and multiplicity formulae. We also showed that nilradicals N of minimal parabolic subgroups P = MAN enjoy that "stepwise square integrable" property. Here we extend those results from N to P. The Pfaffian polynomials, which give orthogonality relations and Plancherel density for N, also give a semiinvariant differential operator that compensates lack of unimodularity for P. The result is a completely explicit Plancherel formula for P.
