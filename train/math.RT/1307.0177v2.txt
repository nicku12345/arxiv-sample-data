Let N be a simply connected, connected nilpotent Lie group with the following assumptions. Its Lie Lie algebra \mathfrak{n} is an n-dimensional vector space over the reals. Moreover, \mathfrak{n=z}\oplus\mathfrak{b}\oplus\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{z} is the center of \mathfrak{n}, \mathfrak{z} =\mathbb{R}Z_{n-2d}\oplus\mathbb{R}Z_{n-2d-1}\oplus\cdots\oplus \mathbb{R}Z_{1}, \mathfrak{b} =\mathbb{R}Y_{d}\oplus\mathbb{R} Y_{d-1}\oplus\cdots\oplus\mathbb{R}Y_{1}, \mathfrak{a} =\mathbb{R}X_{d}\oplus\mathbb{R}X_{d-1}\oplus\cdots\oplus \mathbb{R}X_{1}. Next, assume \mathfrak{z}\oplus\mathfrak{b} is a maximal commutative ideal of \mathfrak{n}, \left[ \mathfrak{a,b}\right] \subseteq\mathfrak{z}, and \mathrm{det}\left([X_i,Y_j]\right)_{1\leq i,j\leq d} is a non-trivial homogeneous polynomial defined over the ideal \left[ \mathfrak{n,n}\right] \subseteq\mathfrak{z}. We do not assume that [\mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{a}] is generally trivial. We obtain some precise description of band-limited spaces which are sampling subspaces of L^2(N) with respect to some discrete set \Gamma. The set \Gamma is explicitly constructed by fixing a Jordan-H\"{o}lder basis for \mathfrak{n}. We provide sufficient conditions for which a function f is determined from its sampled values on (f(\gamma))_{\gamma \in\Gamma}. We also provide an explicit formula for the corresponding sinc-type functions. Several examples are also computed in the paper.
