Given a triangulation of a polygon P with n vertices, we associate an ice quiver with potential such that the associated Jacobian algebra has the structure of a Gorenstein tiled K[x]-order L. Then we show that the stable category of the category of Cohen-Macaulay L-modules is equivalent to the cluster category C of Dynkin type A(n-3).   It gives a natural interpretation of the usual indexation of cluster tilting objects of C by triangulations of P. Moreover, it extends naturally the triangulated categorification by C of the cluster algebra of type A(n-3) to an exact categorification by adding coefficients corresponding to the sides of P. Finally, we lift the previous equivalence of categories to an equivalence between the stable category of graded Cohen-Macaulay L-modules and the bounded derived category of modules over a quiver of type A(n-3).
