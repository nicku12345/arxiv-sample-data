A geometric extension algebra is an extension algebra of a semi-simple perverse sheaf (allowing shifts), e.g. a push-forward of the constant sheaf under a projective map. Particular nice situations arise for collapsings of homogeneous vector bundle over homogeneous spaces. In this paper, we study the relationship between partial flag and complete flag cases. Our main result is that the locally finite modules over the geometric extension algebras are related by a recollement. As examples, we investigate parabolic affine nil Hecke algebras, geometric extension algebras associated to parabolic Springer maps and an example of Reineke of a parabolic quiver-graded Hecke algebra.
