Using a theorem proved by Bekka and Driutti, we show that if \mathfrak{f} is a freely generated nilpotent Lie algebra of step-two, then almost every irreducible representation of the corresponding Lie group restricted to some lattice \Gamma is an irreducible representation of \Gamma if the dimension of the Lie algebra is odd. However, if the dimension of the Lie algebra is even, then almost every unitary irreducible representation of the Lie group restricted to \Gamma is reducible.
