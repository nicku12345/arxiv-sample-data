Let G be a split connected reductive group over a finite extension F of Q_p. We determine the extensions between unitary continuous p-adic and smooth mod p principal series of G(F) in the generic case. In order to do so, we compute Emerton's delta-functor \mathrm{H^\bullet Ord}_{B(F)} of derived ordinary parts with respect to a Borel subgroup on certain induced representations of G(F) using a Bruhat filtration. These extensions come into play in the p-adic and mod p Langlands programs.
