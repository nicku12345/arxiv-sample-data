For the exceptional types E_6, E_7, and E_8, we prove that the specializations at roots of unity of the quantum dimensions of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules give real solutions of \ell-restricted Q-systems, as conjectured by Kuniba, Nakanishi, and Suzuki. We also show that these solutions are positive in type E_6. In type E_7 and E_8, we only prove positivity for a subset of the nodes of the Dynkin diagram.
