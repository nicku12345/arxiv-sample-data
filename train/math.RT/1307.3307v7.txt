We begin the study of a tilting theory in certain truncated categories of modules \mathcal G(\Gamma) for the current Lie algebra associated to a finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra, where \Gamma = P^+ \times J, J is an interval in \mathbb Z, and P^+ is the set of dominant integral weights of the simple Lie algebra. We use this to put a tilting theory on the category \mathcal G(\Gamma') where \Gamma' = P' \times J, where P'\subseteq P^+ is saturated. Under certain natural conditions on \Gamma', we note that \mathcal G(\Gamma') admits full tilting modules.
