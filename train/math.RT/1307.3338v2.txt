In a recent article we introduced a mechanism for producing a presentation of the descent algebra of the symmetric group as a quiver with relations, the mechanism arising from a new construction of the descent algebra as a homomorphic image of an algebra of binary forests. Here we extend the method to construct a similar presentation of the descent algebra of the hyperoctahedral group, providing a simple proof of the known formula for the quiver of this algebra and a straightforward method for calculating the relations.
