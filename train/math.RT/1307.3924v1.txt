This paper introduces the notion of Brauer-friendly modules, a generalisation of endo-p-permutation modules. A module over a block algebra OGe is said to be Brauer-friendly if it is a direct sum of indecomposable modules with compatible fusion-stable endopermutation sources. We obtain, for these modules, a functorial version of Dade's slash construction, also known as deflation-restriction. We prove that our slash functors, defined over Brauer-friendly categories, share most of the very useful properties that are satisfied by the Brauer functor over the category of p-permutation OGe-modules. In particular, we give a parametrisation of indecomposable Brauer-friendly modules, which opens the way to a complete classification whenever the fusion-stable sources are classified. Those tools have been used to prove the existence of a stable equivalence between non-principal blocks in the context of a minimal counter-example to the odd Z*p-theorem.
