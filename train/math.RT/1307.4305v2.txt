We establish the existence of Demazure flags for graded local Weyl modules for hyper current algebras in positive characteristic. If the underlying simple Lie algebra is simply laced, the flag has length one, i.e., the graded local Weyl modules are isomorphic to Demazure modules. This extends to the positive characteristic setting results of Fourier-Littelmann and Naoi for current algebras in characteristic zero. Using this result, we prove that the character of local Weyl modules for hyper loop algebras depend only on the highest weight, but not on the (algebraically closed) ground field, and deduce a tensor product factorization for them.
