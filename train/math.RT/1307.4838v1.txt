In this paper, we introduce a notion of unistructural cluster algebras, for which the set of cluster variables uniquely determines the clusters. We prove that cluster algebras of Dynkin type and cluster algebras of rank 2 are unistructural, then prove that if \mathcal{A} is unistructural or of Euclidean type, then f: \mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{A} is a cluster automorphism if and only if f is an automorphism of the ambient field which restricts to a permutation of the cluster variables. In order to prove this result, we also investigate the Fomin-Zelevinsky conjecture that two cluster variables are compatible if and only if one does not appear in the denominator of the Laurent expansions of the other.
