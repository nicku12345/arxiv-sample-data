In this paper, we give sufficient properties for a finite dimensional graded algebra to be a higher preprojective algebra. These properties are of homological nature, they use Gorensteiness and bimodule isomorphisms in the stable category of Cohen-Macaulay modules. We prove that these properties are also necessary for 3-preprojective algebras using \cite{Kel11} and for preprojective algebras of higher representation finite algebras using \cite{Dugas}.
