Let \pi' be a cuspidal automorphic representation of GL_{2n}, which is assumed to be the Jacquet-Langlands transfer from a cuspidal automorphic representation \pi of GL_{2m}(D), where D is a division algebra so that GL_{2m}(D) is an inner form of GL_{2n}. In this paper, we consider the relation between linear periods on \pi and \pi'. We conjecture that the non-vanishing of the linear period on \pi would imply the non-vanishing of that on \pi'. We illustrate an approach using a relative trace formula towards this conjecture, and prove the existence of smooth transfer over non-archimedean local fields.
