We construct all cuspidal l-modular representations of a unitary group in three variables attached to an unramified extension of local fields of odd residual characteristic p with l\neq p. We describe the l-modular principal series and show that the supercuspidal support of an irreducible l-modular representation is unique up to conjugacy.
