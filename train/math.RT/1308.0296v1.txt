The unitary principal series representations of G=GL(n,\mathbb{C}) induced from a character of the maximal parabolic subgroup P=(GL(1,\mathbb{C})\times GL(n-1,\mathbb{C}))\ltimes\mathbb{C}^{n-1} attain the minimal Gelfand--Kirillov dimension among all infinite-dimensional unitary representations of G. We find the explicit branching laws for the restriction of these representations to symmetric subgroups of G.
