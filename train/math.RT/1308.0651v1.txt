Let \g be an untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra of type A^{(1)}_n (n \ge 1) or D^{(1)}_n (n \ge 4) and let \g_0 be the underlying finite-dimensional simple Lie subalgebra of \g. For each Dynkin quiver Q of type \g_0, Hernandez and Leclerc (\cite{HL11}) introduced a tensor subcategory \CC_Q of the category of finite-dimensional integrable \uqpg-modules and proved that the Grothendieck ring of \CC_Q is isomorphic to \C [N], the coordinate ring of the unipotent group N associated with \g_0. We apply the generalized quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality introduced in \cite{KKK13} to construct an exact functor \F from the category of finite-dimensional graded R-modules to the category \CC_Q, where R denotes the symmetric quiver Hecke algebra associated to \g_0. We prove that the homomorphism induced by the functor \F coincides with the homomorphism of Hernandez and Leclerc and show that the functor \F sends the simple modules to the simple modules.
