Let F be a p-adic field, and K a quadratic extension of F. Using Tadic's classification of the unitary dual of GL(n,K), we give the list of irreducible unitary representations of this group distinguished by GL(n,F), in terms of distinguished discrete series. As it is known that a generalised Steinberg representation St(k,\rho) is distinguished if and only if the cuspidal representation \rho is \eta^{k-1}-distinguished, for \eta the character of F^* with kernel the norms of K^*, this actually gives a classification of distinguished unitary representations in terms of distinguished cuspidal representations.
