For an acyclic quiver Q and a finite-dimensional algebra A, we give a unified form of the indecomposable injective objects in the monomorphism category {\rm Mon}(Q,A) and prove that {\rm Mon}(Q, A) has enough injective objects. As applications, we show that for a given self-injective algebra A, a tilting object in the stable category \underline{A}-mod induces a natural tilting object in the stable monomorphism category \underline{\rm Mon}(Q,A). We also realize the singularity category of the algebra kQ\otimes_k A as the stable monomorphism category of the module category of A.
