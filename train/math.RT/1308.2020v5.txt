It is known that there is a bijection between dominant weights of a complex reductive Lie group G and the set \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{O},r} whose elements are of the form (\mathcal{O},\rho), where \mathcal{O} is a nilpotent orbit and \rho is an irreducible, algebraic representation of the stabilizer group G^e of an element e in the nilpotent orbit \mathcal{O}. We would like to study the above bijection when G is classical and \rho corresponds to a local system of \mathcal{O}. In particular, we will prove Conjecture 3.1 in \cite{AS} and Conjecture 7.4' in \cite{Ac2} in the classical setting.
