We study generic objects in triangulated categories and characterize the finite dimensional algebras A such that the derived categories D(\Mod A) are generically trivial. This is an analogue of a result of Crawley-Boevey for module categories. As a consequence, we show that D(\Mod A) is generically trivial if and only if the category of perfect complexes K^b(\proj A) is locally finite.
