Generalizing the super duality formalism for finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras of type ABCD, we establish an equivalence between parabolic BGG categories of a Kac-Moody Lie superalgebra and a Kac-Moody Lie algebra. The characters for a large family of irreducible highest weight modules over a symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie superalgebra are then given in terms of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for the first time. We formulate a notion of integrable modules over a symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie superalgebra via super duality, and show that these integrable modules form a semisimple tensor subcategory, whose Littlewood-Richardson tensor product multiplicities coincide with those in the Kac-Moody algebra setting.
