We study the ring of invariants for a finite dimensional representation V of the group C_2 of order 2 in characteristic 2. Let \sigma denote a generator of C_2 and \{x_1,y_1 \dots, x_m,y_m\} a basis of V^*. Then \sigma(x_i) = x_i, and \sigma(y_i) = y_i + x_i. To our knowledge, this ring (for any prime p) was first studied by David Richman in 1990. He gave a first main theorem for (V_2, C_2), that is, he proved that the ring of invariants when p=2 is generated by \{x_i, N_i = y_i^2 + x_iy_i, tr(A) | 2 \le |A| \le m\} where A \subset \{0,1\}^m, y^A = y_1^{a_1} y_2^{a_2} \cdots y_m^{a_m} and tr(A) = y^A + (y_1+x_1)^{a_1}(y_2+x_2)^{a_2} \cdots (y_m+x_m)^{a_m}. In this paper, we prove the second main theorem for (V_2, C_2), that is, we show that all relations between these generators are generated by relations of type I: \sum_{I \subset A } x^I tr(A-I) and of type II: tr(A) tr(B) = \sum_{L < I} x^{I-L} N^L tr(I-L+J+K) + N^I \sum_{L < J} x^{J-L} tr(L+K) for all m. We also derive relations of type III which are simpler and can be used in place of the relations of type II.
