Let \Irr(W) be the set of irreducible representations of a finite Weyl group W. Following an idea from Spaltenstein, Geck has recently introduced a preorder \leq_L on \Irr(W) in connection with the notion of Lusztig families. In a later paper with Iancu, they have shown that in type B (in the asymptotic case and in the equal parameter case) this order coincides with the order on Lusztig symbols as defined by Geck and the second author in \cite{GJ}. In this paper, we show that this caracterisation extends to the so-called integer case, that is when the ratio of the parameters is an integer.
