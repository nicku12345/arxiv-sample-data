Let S_\lambda denote the Specht module defined by Dipper and James for the Iwahori-Hecke algebra \mathscr{H}_n of the symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_n. When e=2 we determine the decomposability of all Specht modules corresponding to hook partitions (a,1^b). We do so by utilising the Brundan-Kleshchev isomorphism between \mathscr{H} and a Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebra and working with the relevant KLR algebra, using the set-up of Kleshchev-Mathas-Ram. When n is even, we easily arrive at the conclusion that S_\lambda is indecomposable. When n is odd, we find an endomorphism of S_\lambda and use it to obtain a generalised eigenspace decomposition of S_\lambda.
