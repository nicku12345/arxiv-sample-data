Let \frb be a fixed Borel subalgebra of a finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra \frg. The Shi bijection associates to every ad-nilpotent ideal \fri of \frb a region V_{\fri}. In this paper, we show that \fri is abelian if and only if V_{\fri}\cap 2A is empty, if and only if the volume of V_{\fri}\cap 2A equals to that of A, where A is the fundamental alcove of the affine Weyl group. For certain flag of abelian ideals, we record an ascending property of their associated regions. We also determine the maximal eigenvalue m_{r-1} of the Casimir operator on \wedge^{r-1} \frg and the corresponding eigenspace M_{r-1}, where r is the number of positive roots.
