In this paper we extend the calculation of the geometric Waldspurger periods from our paper math/0510110 to the case of ramified coverings. We give some applications to the study of Whittaker coefficients of the theta-lifting of automorphic sheaves from PGL_2 to the metaplectic group Mp_2, they agree with our conjectures from arXiv:1211.1596. In the process of the proof, we get some new automorphic sheaves for GL_2 in the ramified setting. We also formulate stronger conjectures about Waldspurger periods and geometric theta-lifting for the dual pair (SL_2, Mp_2).
