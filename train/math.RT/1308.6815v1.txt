In this paper we introduce and study n-point Virasoro algebras, \tilde{\W_a}, which are natural generalizations of the classical Virasoro algebra and have as quotients multipoint genus zero Krichever-Novikov type algebras. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the latter two such Lie algebras to be isomorphic. Moreover we determine their automorphisms, their derivation algebras, their universal central extensions, and some other properties. The list of automorphism groups that occur is C_n, D_n, A_4, S_4 and A_5. We also construct a large class of modules which we call modules of densities, and determine necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be irreducible.
