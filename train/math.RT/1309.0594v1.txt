This is a short announcement and summary of the results of arxiv:1111.7057, arxiv.org:1111.4405, and Appendix B to arxiv:1208.1945. In particular, we emphasize the exposition of the ideas related to model theory and motivic integration, and simplify the definitions, to make these results easily accessible to non-model theorists.
