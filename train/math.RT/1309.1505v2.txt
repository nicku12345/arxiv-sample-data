We explicitly compute examples of sheaves over the projectivization of the spectrum of the cohomology of sl_2. In particular, we compute \ker\Theta_M for every indecomposable M and we compute F_i(M) when M is an indecomposable Weyl module and i \neq p. We also give a brief review of the classification of sl_2-modules and of the general theory of such sheaves in the case of a restricted Lie algebra.
