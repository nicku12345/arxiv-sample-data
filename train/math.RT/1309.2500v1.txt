Let {\boldsymbol{G}} be a connected reductive group defined over a non--Archimedean local field F. Put G={\boldsymbol{G}}(F). Let \theta be an F--automorphism of {\boldsymbol{G}}, and let \omega be a smooth character of G. This paper is concerned with the smooth complex representations \pi of G such that \pi^\theta=\pi\circ\theta is isomorphic to \omega\pi=\omega\otimes\pi. If \pi is admissible, in particular irreducible, the choice of an isomorphism A from \omega\pi to \pi^\theta (and of a Haar measure on G) defines a distribution \Theta_\pi^A={\rm tr}(\pi\circ A) on G. The twisted Fourier transform associates to a compactly supported locally constant function f on G, the function (\pi,A)\mapsto \Theta_\pi^A(f) on a suitable Grothendieck group. Here we describe its image (Paley--Wiener theorem), and we reduce the description of its kernel (spectral density theorem) to a result on the discrete part of the theory.
