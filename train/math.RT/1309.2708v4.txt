The Jacobian algebra associated to a triangulation of a closed surface S with a collection of marked points M is (weakly) symmetric and tame. We show that for these algebras the Auslander-Reiten translate acts 2-periodical on objects. Moreover, we show that excluding only the case of a sphere with 4 (or less) punctures, these algebras are of exponential growth. These four properties implies that there is a new family of algebras symmetric, tame and with periodic module category.   As a consequence of the 2-periodical actions of the Auslander-Reiten translate on objects, we have that the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the generalized cluster category \cC_{(S,M)} consists only of stable tubes of rank 1 or 2.
