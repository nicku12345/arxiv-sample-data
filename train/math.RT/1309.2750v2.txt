Call a compact, connected, simple Lie group G {\emph{adjoint simple}} if it has trivial center. Let C\subset G be a nontrivial conjugacy class, e\in G the identity element of G. We prove the existence of an N\in\mathbb{N}, depending on G but not C, such that e lies in the interior of C^n for all n\geq N. We then prove that a disk D\subset\mathbb{C} of radius less than 1, contained in the unit disk D_1 and tangent to D_1 at z=1, contains the image of every normalized character \chi(e)^{-1}\chi of G.
