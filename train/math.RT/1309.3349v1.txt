Let C be a finite EI category and k be a field. We consider the category algebra kC. Suppose K(C)=D^b(kC-mod) is the bounded derived category of finitely generated left modules. This is a tensor triangulated category and we compute its spectrum in the sense of Balmer. When C=G*P is a finite transporter category, the category algebra becomes Gorenstein so we can define the stable module category \CM k(G*P), of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, as a quotient category of K(G*P). Since \CM k(G*P) is also tensor triangulated, we compute its spectrum as well.   These spectra are used to classify tensor ideal thick subcategories of the corresponding tensor triangulated categories, despite the fact that the previously mentioned tensor categories are not rigid.
