We determine explicitly the maximal dominant weights for the integrable highest weight \hat{sl}(n)-modules V((k-1)\Lambda_0 + \Lambda_s), 0 \leq s \leq n-1,  k \geq 2. We give a conjecture for the number of maximal dominant weights of V(k\Lambda_0) and prove it in some low rank cases. We give an explicit formula in terms of lattice paths for the multiplicities of a family of maximal dominant weights of V(k\Lambda_0). We conjecture that these multiplicities are equal to the number of certain pattern avoiding permutations. We prove that the conjecture holds for k=2 and give computational evidence for the validity of this conjecture for k >2.
