Let \g be any simple Lie algebra over \mathbb{C}. Recall that there exists an embedding of \mathfrak{sl}_2 into \g, called a principal TDS, passing through a principal nilpotent element of \g and uniquely determined up to conjugation. Moreover, \wedge (\g^*)^\g is freely generated (in the super-graded sense) by primitive elements \omega_1, \dots, \omega_\ell, where \ell is the rank of \g. N. Hitchin conjectured that for any primitive element \omega \in \wedge^d (\g^*)^\g, there exists an irreducible \mathfrak{sl}_2-submodule V_\omega \subset \g of dimension d such that \omega is non-zero on the line \wedge^d (V_\omega). We prove that the validity of this conjecture for simple simply-laced Lie algebras implies its validity for any simple Lie algebra.   Let G be a connected, simply-connected, simple, simply-laced algebraic group and let \sigma be a diagram automorphism of G with fixed subgroup K. Then, we show that the restriction map R(G) \to R(K) is surjective, where R denotes the representation ring over \mathbb{Z}. As a corollary, we show that the restriction map in the singular cohomology H^*(G)\to H^*(K) is surjective. Our proof of the reduction of Hitchin's conjecture to the simply-laced case relies on this cohomological surjectivity.
