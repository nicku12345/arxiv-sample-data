In this paper, we develop the fundamentals of Lie-Poisson theory for direct limits G=\dirlim G_{n} of complex algebraic groups G_{n} and their Lie algebras \fg=\dirlim \fg_{n}. We show that \fg^{*}=\invlim\fg_{n}^{*} has the structure of a Poisson provariety and that each coadjoint orbit of G on \fg^{*} has the structure of an ind-variety. We construct a weak symplectic form on every coadjoint orbit and prove that the coadjoint orbits form a weak symplectic foliation of the Poisson provariety \fg^{*}. We apply our results to the specific setting of G=GL(\infty)=\dirlim GL(n,\C) and \fg^{*}= M(\infty)=\invlim \fgl(n,\C), the space of infinite complex matrices with arbitrary entries. We construct a Gelfand-Zeitlin integrable system on M(\infty), which generalizes the one constructed by Kostant and Wallach on \fgl(n,\C). The system integrates to an action of a direct limit group A(\infty) on M(\infty), whose generic orbits are Lagrangian ind-subvarieties of the corresponding coadjoint orbit of GL(\infty) on M(\infty).
