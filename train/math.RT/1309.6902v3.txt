In this paper, we exhibit explicitly a sequence of 2\times2 matrix valued orthogonal polynomials with respect to a weight W_{p,n}, for any pair of real numbers p and n such that 0<p<n.   The entries of these polynomiales are expressed in terms of the Gegenbauer polynomials C_k^\lambda. Also the corresponding three-term recursion relations are given and we make some studies of the algebra of differential operators associated with the weight W_{p,n}.
