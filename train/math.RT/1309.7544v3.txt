Let \bbcq be the quantum torus associated with the d \times d matrix q = (q_{ij}), q_{ii} = 1, q_{ij}^{-1} = q_{ji}, q_{ij} are roots of unity, for all 1 \leq i, j \leq d. Let \Der(\bbcq) be the Lie algebra of all the derivations of \bbcq. In this paper we define the Lie algebra \Der(\bbcq) \ltimes \bbcq and classify its modules which are irreducible and have finite dimensional weight spaces. These modules under certain conditions turn out to be of the form V \otimes \bbcq, where V is a finite dimensional irreducible gl_d-module.
