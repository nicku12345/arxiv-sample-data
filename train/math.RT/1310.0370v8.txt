Let V=V_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_n be a vector space over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero with \dim(V_i)=d_i. We study the ring of polynomial invariants K[\operatorname{End}(V)^{\oplus m}]^{\operatorname{GL}_{\mathbf{d}}} of m endomorphisms of V under the adjoint action of \operatorname{GL}_{\mathbf{d}}:=\operatorname{GL}(V_1) \times \cdots \times \operatorname{GL}(V_n). We find that the ring is generated by certain generalized trace monomials \operatorname{Tr}^M_{\sigma} where M is a multiset with entries in [m]=\{1,\dots, m\} and \sigma \in \mathcal{S}_m^n is a choice of n permutations of [m]. We find that K[\operatorname{End}(V)^{\oplus m}]^{\operatorname{GL}_{\mathbf{d}}} is generated by the \operatorname{Tr}^M_\sigma of degree at most \frac{3}{8}m\dim(V)^6.
