We give the decomposition into irreducible factors of Weil representations of the symplectic groups at even levels, generalizing previous decompositions at odd levels. We then derive the decomposition of the quantum representations of SL2(Z) arising in the SU(2) and SO(3) TQFTs. As application we show that, when the level indexing the TQFT is not a multiple of 4, the universal construction applied to a cobordism category without framed links leads to the same TQFT.
