Let G be a complex reductive group, B be a Borel subgroup of G, \nt be the Lie algebra of the unipotent radical of B, and \nt^* be its dual space. Let \Phi be the root system of G, and \Phi^+ be the set of positive roots with respect to B.   A subset of \Phi^+ is called a rook placement if it consists of roots with pairwise non-positive inner products. To each rook placement D one can associate the coadjoint orbit \Omega_D of B in \nt^*. By definition, \Omega_D is the orbit of f_D, where f_D is the sum of root covectors corresponging to the roots from D. We find the dimension of \Omega_D and construct a polarization of \nt at f_D. We also study the partial order on the set of rook placements induced by the incidences among the orbits associated with rook placements.
