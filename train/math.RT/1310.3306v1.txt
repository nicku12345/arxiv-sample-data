We re-write the character formul{\ae} of Adler and the second-named author in a form amenable to explicit computations in p-adic harmonic analysis, and use them to prove the stability of character sums for a modification of Reeder's conjectural positive-depth, unramified, toral supercuspidal L-packets.
