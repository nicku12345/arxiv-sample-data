Let A be a finite-dimensional algebra with two simple modules. It is shown that if the derived category of A admits a stratification with simple factors being the base field k, then A is derived equivalent to a quasi-hereditary algebra. As a consequence, if further k is algebraically closed and A has finite global dimension, then A is either derived simple or derived equivalent to a quasi-hereditary algebra
