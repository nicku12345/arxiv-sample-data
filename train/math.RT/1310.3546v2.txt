We introduce a notion of elliptic fake degrees for unipotent elliptic representations of a semisimple p-adic group. We conjecture, and verify in some cases, that the relation between the formal degrees of unipotent discrete series representations of a semisimple p-adic group and the elliptic fake degrees is given by the exotic Fourier transform matrix introduced by Lusztig in the study of representations of finite groups of Lie type.
