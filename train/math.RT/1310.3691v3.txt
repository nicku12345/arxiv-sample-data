In this paper we compute b-functions (or Bernstein-Sato polynomials) of various semi-invariants of quivers. The main tool is an explicit relation for the b-functions between semi-invariants that correspond to each other under reflection functors (or castling transforms). This enables us to compute recursively the b-functions for all Dynkin quivers, and extended Dynkin quivers with prehomogeneous dimension vectors.
