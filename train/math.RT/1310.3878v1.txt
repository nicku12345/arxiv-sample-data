The Iwahori-Hecke algebra of the symmetric group is the convolution algebra of \gl_n-invariant functions on the variety of pairs of complete flags over a finite field. Considering convolution on the space of triples of two flags and a vector we obtain the mirabolic Hecke algebra R_n, which had originally been described by Solomon. In this paper we give a new presentation for R_n which shows that it is a quotient of a cyclotomic Hecke algebra, as defined by Ariki and Koike. From this we recover the results of Siegel about the representations of R_n. We use Jucys-Murphy elements to describe the center of R_n and to give a \mathfrak{gl}_\infty-structure on the Grothendieck group of the category of its representations, giving `mirabolic' analogues of classical results about the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. We also outline a strategy towards a proof of the conjecture that the mirabolic Hecke algebra is a cellular algebra.
