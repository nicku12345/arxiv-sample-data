We give conceptual proofs of certain basic properties of the arrangement of shifted root hyperplanes associated to a root system and a Weyl group invariant real valued parameter function on the root system. The method is based on the role of this shifted root hyperplane arrangement for the harmonic analysis of affine Hecke algebras. In addition this yields a conceptual proof of the description of the central support of the Plancherel measure of an affine Hecke algebra given in math.RT.0101007v4.
