We show that many cluster-theoretic properties of the Markov quiver hold also for adjacency quivers of triangulations of once-punctured closed surfaces of arbitrary genus.   Along the way we consider the class P of quivers introduced by Kontsevich and Soibelman, characterize the mutation-finite quivers that belong to that class and draw some conclusions regarding non-degenerate potentials on them.
