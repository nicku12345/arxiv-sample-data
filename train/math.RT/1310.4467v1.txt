We prove that the Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras R_\alpha of finite type are (graded) affine cellular in the sense of Koenig and Xi. In fact, we establish a stronger property, namely that the affine cell ideals in R_\alpha are generated by idempotents. This in particular implies the (known) result that the global dimension of R_\alpha is finite.
