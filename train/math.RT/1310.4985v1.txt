Let \Gamma be a generic subgroup of the multiplicative group \mathbb{C}^* of nonzero complex numbers. We define a class of Lie algebras associated to \Gamma, called twisted \Gamma-Lie algebras, which is a natural generalization of the twisted affine Lie algebras. Starting from an arbitrary even sublattice Q of \mathbb Z^N and an arbitrary finite order isometry of \mathbb Z^N preserving Q, we construct a family of twisted \Gamma-vertex operators acting on generalized Fock spaces which afford irreducible representations for certain twisted \Gamma-Lie algebras. As application, this recovers a number of known vertex operator realizations for infinite dimensional Lie algebras, such as twisted affine Lie algebras, extended affine Lie algebras of type A, trigonometric Lie algebras of series A and B, unitary Lie algebras, and BC-graded Lie algebras.
