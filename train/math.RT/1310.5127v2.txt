We develop some aspects of the theory of D-modules on ind-schemes of pro-finite type. These notions are used to define D-modules on (algebraic) loop groups and, consequently, actions of loop groups on DG categories.   Let N be the maximal unipotent subgroup of a reductive group G. For a non-degenerate character \chi: N(\!(t)\!) \to \mathbb{G}_a and a category \mathcal{C} acted upon by N(\!(t)\!) , we define the category \mathcal{C}^{N(\!(t)\!), \chi} of (N(\!(t)\!), \chi)-invariant objects, along with the coinvariant category \mathcal{C}_{N(\!(t)\!), \chi}. These are the Whittaker categories of \mathcal{C}, which are in general not equivalent. However, there is always a family of functors \Theta_k: \mathcal{C}_{N(\!(t)\!), \chi} \to \mathcal{C}^{N(\!(t)\!), \chi}, parametrized by k \in \mathbb{Z}.   We conjecture that each \Theta_k is an equivalence, provided that the N(\!(t)\!)-action on \mathcal{C} extends to a G(\!(t)\!)-action. Using the Fourier-Deligne transform (adapted to Tate vector spaces), we prove this conjecture for G= GL_n and show that the Whittaker categories can be obtained by taking invariants of \mathcal{C} with respect to a very explicit pro-unipotent group subscheme (not ind-scheme) of G(\!(t)\!).
