Let G be an algebraic real reductive group and Z a real spherical G-variety, that is, it admits an open orbit for a minimal parabolic subgroup P. We prove a local structure theorem for Z. In the simplest case where Z is homogeneous, the theorem provides an isomorphism of the open P-orbit with a bundle Q \times_L S. Here Q is a parabolic subgroup with Levi decomposition LU, and S is a homogeneous space for a quotient D=L/L_n of L, where L_n is normal in L, such that D is compact modulo center.
