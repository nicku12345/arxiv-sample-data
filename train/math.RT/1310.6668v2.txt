We define an analogue of the Dirac operator for the degenerate affine Hecke-Clifford algebra. A main result is to relate the central characters of the degenerate affine Hecke-Clifford algebra with the central characters of the Sergeev algebra via Dirac cohomology. The action of the Dirac operator on certain modules is also computed. Results in this paper could be viewed as a projective version of the Dirac cohomology of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra.
