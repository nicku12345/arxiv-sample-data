We introduce the notion of spectral transfer morphisms between normalized affine Hecke algebras, and show that such morphisms induce spectral measure preserving correspondences on the level of the tempered spectra of the affine Hecke algebras involved. We define a partial ordering on the set of isomorphism classes of normalized affine Hecke algebras, which plays an important role for the Langlands parameters of Lusztig's unipotent representations.
