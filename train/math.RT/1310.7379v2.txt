We study the decomposition matrices for the unipotent \ell-blocks of finite special unitary groups SU_n(q) for unitary primes \ell larger than n. Up to very few unknown entries, we give a complete solution for n=2,\ldots,10. We also prove a general result for two-column partitions when \ell divides q+1. This is achieved using projective modules coming from the \ell-adic cohomology of Deligne--Lusztig varieties.
