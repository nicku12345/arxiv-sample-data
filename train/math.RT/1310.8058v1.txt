This paper is a review of results on generalized Harish-Chandra modules in the framework of cohomological induction. The main results, obtained during the last 10 years, concern the structure of the fundamental series of (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})-modules, where \mathfrak{g} is a semisimple Lie algebra and \mathfrak{k} is an arbitrary algebraic reductive in \mathfrak{g} subalgebra. These results lead to a classification of simple (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})-modules of finite type with generic minimal \mathfrak{k}-types, which we state. We establish a new result about the Fernando-Kac subalgebra of a fundamental series module. In addition, we pay special attention to the case when \mathfrak{k} is an eligible r-subalgebra (see the definition in section 4) in which we prove stronger versions of our main results. If \mathfrak{k} is eligible, the fundamental series of (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})-modules yields a natural algebraic generalization of Harish-Chandra's discrete series modules.
