This talk was presented at Workshop "Spectral Methods in Representation Theory of Algebras and Applications to the Study of Rings of Singularities", 2008 (Banff, Canada). W. Ebeling established a connection between certain Poincare series, the Coxeter transformation C, and the corresponding affine Coxeter transformation C_a (in the context of the McKay correspondence). We consider the generalized Poincare series [\tilde{P}_G(t)]_0 for the case of multiply-laced diagrams(in the context of the McKay-Slodowy correspondence) and extend the Ebeling theorem for this case: [\tilde{P}_G(t)]_0 = X(t^2)/\tilde{X}(t^2), where X is the characteristic polynomial of the Coxeter transformation and \tilde{X} is the characteristic polynomial of the corresponding affine Coxeter transformation. We obtain that Poincare series coincide for pairs of diagrams obtained by folding: X ({\Gamma}) / X (\tilde{{\Gamma}}) = X ({\Gamma}^f) / X (\tilde{{\Gamma}}^f), where {\Gamma} is any (A, D, E type) Dynkin diagram, {\Gamma} is the extended Dynkin diagram, and the diagrams {\Gamma}^f and \tilde{{\Gamma}}^f are obtained by folding from {\Gamma} and \tilde{{\Gamma}}, respectively.
