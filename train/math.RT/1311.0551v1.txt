Let G be a unipotent group over a field of characteristic p > 0. The theory of character sheaves on G was initiated by V. Drinfeld and developed jointly with D. Boyarchenko. They also introduced the notion of \mathbb{L}-packets of character sheaves. Each \mathbb{L}-packet can be described in terms of a modular category. Now suppose that the nilpotence class of G is less than p. Then the \mathbb{L}-packets are in bijection with the set \mathfrak{g}^*/G of coadjoint orbits, where \mathfrak{g} is the Lie ring scheme obtained from G using the Lazard correspondence and \mathfrak{g}^* is the Serre dual of G. If \Omega is a coadjoint orbit, then the corresponding modular category can be identified with the category of G-equivariant local systems on \Omega. This in turn is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional representations of a finite group. However, the associativity, braiding and ribbon constraints are nontrivial. Drinfeld gave a conjectural description of these constraints in 2006. In this article, we prove the formula describing the ribbon structure when \dim(\Omega) is even.
