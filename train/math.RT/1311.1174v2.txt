We construct via generators and relations a generalized Weil representation for the split orthogonal group \ot_q(2n,2n) over a finite field of q elements. Besides, we give an initial decomposition of the representation found. We also show that the constructed representation is equal to the restriction of the Weil representation to \ot_q(2n,2n) for the reductive dual pair (\Sp_2(\mathbb{F}_q),\ot_q(2n,2n)) and that the initial decomposition is the same as the decomposition with respect to the action of \Sp_2(\mathbb{F}_q).
