An algorithm for the explicit computation of a complete set of primitive central idempotents, Wedderburn decomposition and the automorphism group of the semisimple group algebra of a finite metabelian group is developed. The algorithm is illustrated with its application to the semisimple group algebra of an arbitrary metacyclic group, and certain indecomposable groups whose central quotient is the Klein four-group.
