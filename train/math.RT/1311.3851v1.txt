Let (G, H) be a symmetric pair for a real semisimple Lie group G and (G, H_0) its associated pair. For each irreducible square integrable representation \pi of G so that its restriction to H is admissible, we find an irreducible square integrable representation \pi_0 of H_0 which allows to compute the Harish-Chandra parameter of each irreducible H-subrepresentation of \pi as well as its multiplicity. The computation is based on the spectral analysis of the restriction of \pi_0 to a maximal compact subgroup of H_0.
