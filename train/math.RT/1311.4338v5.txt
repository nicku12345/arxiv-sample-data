For a simple complex Lie algebra \mathfrak g we study the space of invariants A=\left( \bigwedge \mathfrak g^*\otimes\mathfrak g^*\right)^{\mathfrak g}, (which describes the isotypic component of type \mathfrak g in  \bigwedge \mathfrak g^*) as a module over the algebra of invariants \left(\bigwedge \mathfrak g^*\right)^{\mathfrak g}. As main result we prove that A is a free module, of rank twice the rank of \mathfrak g, over the exterior algebra generated by all primitive invariants in (\bigwedge \mathfrak g^*)^{\mathfrak g}, with the exception of the one of highest degree.
