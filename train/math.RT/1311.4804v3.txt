Mutation of torsion pairs in triangulated categories and its combinatorial interpretation for the cluster category of Dynkin type A_n and of type A_\infty have been studied by Zhou and Zhu. In this paper we present a combinatorial model for mutation of torsion pairs in the cluster category of Dynkin type D_n, using Ptolemy diagrams of Dynkin type D_n which were introduced by Holm, J{\o}rgensen and Rubey.
