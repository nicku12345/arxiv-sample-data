In this article we review the main results of the earlier papers [I. Penkov, K. Styrkas, Tensor representations of infinite-dimensional root-reductive Lie algebras, in Developments and Trends in Infinite-Dimensional Lie Theory, Progress in Mathematics 288, Birkh\"auser, 2011, pp. 127-150], [I. Penkov, V. Serganova, Categories of integrable \mathfrak{sl}(\infty)-, \mathfrak{o}(\infty)-, \mathfrak{sp}(\infty)-modules, in "Representation Theory and Mathematical Physics", Contemporary Mathematics 557 (2011), pp. 335-357] and [E. Dan-Cohen, I. Penkov, V. Serganova, A Koszul category of representations of finitary Lie algebras, preprint 2011, arXiv:1105.3407], and establish related new results in considerably greater generality. We introduce a class of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras \mathfrak{g}^{M}, which we call Mackey Lie algebras, and define monoidal categories \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{g}^M} of tensor \mathfrak{g}^M-modules. We also consider dense subalgebras \mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{g}^M and corresponding categories \mathbb{T}_\mathfrak{a}. The locally finite Lie algebras \mathfrak{sl}(V,W), \mathfrak{o}(V), \mathfrak{sp}(V) are dense subalgebras of respective Mackey Lie algebras. Our main result is that if \mathfrak{g}^M is a Mackey Lie algebra and \mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{g}^M is a dense subalgebra, then the monoidal category \mathbb{T}_\mathfrak{a} is equivalent to \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{sl}(\infty)} or \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{o}(\infty)}; the latter monoidal categories have been studied in detail in [E. Dan-Cohen, I. Penkov, V. Serganova, A Koszul category of representations of finitary Lie algebras, preprint 2011, arXiv:1105.3407]. A possible choice of \mathfrak{a} is the well-known Lie algebra of generalized Jacobi matrices.
