In this article we define a generalization of Lusztig Lagrangian varieties in the case of arbitrary quivers, possibly carrying loops. As opposed to the Lagrangian varieties constructed by Lusztig, which consisted in nilpotent representations, we have to consider here slightly more general representations. That this is necessary is already clear from the Jordan quiver case. Our proof of the Lagrangian character is based on induction, but with non trivial first steps, consisting in the study of quivers with one vertex but possible loops. From our proof emerges a new combinatorial structure on the set of irreducible components, which is more general than the usual crystals, in that there are now more operators associated to a vertex with loops. We finally consider a convolution algebra of constructible functions on our varieties, and construct a family of constructible functions naturally attached to the irreducible components.
