Let q be a prime power and U the group of lower unitriangular matrices of order n for some natural number n. We give a lower bound for the degrees of irreducible constituents of Andr\'{e}-Yan supercharacters and classify the supercharacters having constituents whose degree assume this lower bound. Moreover we show that the number of distinct irreducible characters of U meeting this condition is a polynomial in (q-1) with nonnegative integral coefficients and exhibit monomial sources for those.
