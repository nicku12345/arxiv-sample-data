Consider a simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} and \overline{\mathfrak{g}}% \subset \mathfrak{g} a Levi subalgebra. Two irreducible \overline{% \mathfrak{g}}-modules yield isomorphic inductions to \mathfrak{g} when their highest weights coincide up to conjugation by an element of the Weyl group W of \mathfrak{g} which is also a Dynkin diagram automorphism of % \overline{\mathfrak{g}}. In this paper we study the converse problem: given two irreducible \overline{\mathfrak{g}}-modules of highest weight \mu  and \nu  whose inductions to \mathfrak{g} are isomorphic, can we conclude that \mu  and \nu  are conjugate under the action of an element of W which is also a Dynkin diagram automorphism of \overline{\mathfrak{g}% } ? We conjecture this is true in general. We prove this conjecture in type A and, for the other root systems, in various situations providing \mu  and \nu  satisfy additional hypotheses. Our result can be interpreted as an analogue for branching coefficient of the main result of \cite{Raj} on tensor product multiplicities.
