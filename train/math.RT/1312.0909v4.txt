In this paper, we describe the irreducible spherical functions of fundamental K-types associated with the pair (G,K)=({\mathrm{SO}}(n+1),{\mathrm{SO}}(n)) in terms of matrix hypergeometric functions. The output of this description is that the irreducible spherical functions of the same K-fundamental type are encoded in new examples of classical sequences of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials, of size 2 and 3, with respect to a matrix-weight W supported on [0,1]. Moreover, we show that W has a second order symmetric hypergeometric operator D.
