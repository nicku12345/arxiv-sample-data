In this paper we construct certain irreducible infinite dimensional representations of algebraic groups with Frobenius maps. In particular, a few classical results of Steinberg and Deligne & Lusztig on complex representations of finite groups of Lie type are extended to reductive algebraic groups with Frobenius maps.
