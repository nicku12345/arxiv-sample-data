In this paper, we begin to develop a theory of character sheaves on an affine algebraic group G defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>0 using the approach developed by Boyarchenko and Drinfeld for unipotent groups. Let l be a prime different from p. Following Boyarchenko and Drinfeld, we define the notion of an admissible pair on G and the corresponding idempotent in the \overline{\mathbb{Q}_l}-linear triangulated braided monoidal category \mathscr{D}_G(G) of conjugation equivariant \overline{\mathbb{Q}_l}-complexes (under convolution with compact support) and study their properties. We aim to break up the braided monoidal category \mathscr{D}_G(G) into smaller and more manageable pieces corresponding to these idempotents in \mathscr{D}_G(G). Drinfeld has conjectured that the idempotent in \mathscr{D}_G(G) obtained from an admissible pair is in fact a minimal idempotent and that any minimal idempotent in \mathscr{D}_G(G) can be obtained from some admissible pair on G. We will prove this conjecture in the case when the neutral connected component G^\circ \subset G is a solvable group. For general groups, we prove that this conjecture is in fact equivalent to an a priori weaker conjecture. Using these results, we reduce the problem of defining character sheaves on general algebraic groups to a special case which we call the "Heisenberg case".
