Let O be a complete d.v.r. and G a finite group. We give two applications of an adjunction in the stable category of OG. The first application gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the middle term of an almost split sequence terminating in a Knorr lattice to be indecomposable.   The second characterises the stable endomorphism rings of Heller lattices of kG-modules.
