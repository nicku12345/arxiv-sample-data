Let R be an artin algebra and \mathcal{C} an additive subcategory of \operatorname{mod}(R). We construct a t-structure on the homotopy category \operatorname{K}^{-}(\mathcal{C}) whose heart \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{C}} is a natural domain for higher Auslander-Reiten (AR) theory. The abelian categories \mathcal{H}_{\operatorname{mod}(R)} (which is the natural domain for classical AR theory) and \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{C}} interact via various functors. If \mathcal{C} is functorially finite then \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{C}} is a quotient category of \mathcal{H}_{\operatorname{mod}(R)}. We illustrate the theory with two examples:   Iyama developed a higher AR theory when \mathcal{C} is a maximal n-orthogonal subcategory, see \cite{I}. In this case we show that the simple objects of \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{C}} correspond to Iyama's higher AR sequences and derive his higher AR duality from the existence of a Serre functor on the derived category \operatorname{D}^b(\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{C}}).   The category \mathcal{O} of a complex semi-simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} fits into higher AR theory by considering R to be the coinvariant algebra of the Weyl group of \mathfrak{g}.
