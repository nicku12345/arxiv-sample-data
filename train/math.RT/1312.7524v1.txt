We study the endomorphism algebra of Verma modules for rational Cherednik algebras at t=0. It is shown that, in many cases, these endomorphism algebras are quotients of the centre of the rational Cherednik algebra. Geometrically, they define Lagrangian subvariaties of the generalized Calogero-Moser space. In the introduction, we motivate our results by describing them in the context of derived intersections of Lagrangians.
