In this paper, we discuss the representations of n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie superalgebras as a generalization of the notion of representations for n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie algebras. We also give the cohomology of an n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie superalgebra and obtain a relation between extensions of an n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{b} by an abelian one \mathfrak{a} and Z^1(\mathfrak{b}, \mathfrak{a})_{\bar{0}}. We also introduce the notion of T^*-extensions of n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie superalgebras and prove that every finite-dimensional nilpotent metric n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie superalgebra (\g,[\cdot,\cdots,\cdot]_{\g},\alpha,\langle ,\rangle_{\g}) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic not 2 in the case \alpha is a surjection is isometric to a suitable T^*-extension.
