We study three related topics in representation theory of classical Lie superalgebras. The first one is classification of primitive ideals, i.e. annihilator ideals of simple modules, and inclusions between them. The second topic concerns Arkhipov's twisting functors on the BGG category O. The third topic addresses deformed orbits of the Weyl group. These take over the role of the usual Weyl group orbits for Lie algebras, in the study of primitive ideals and twisting functors for Lie superalgebras.
