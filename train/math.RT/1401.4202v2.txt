Relations between Gorenstein derived categories, Gorenstein defect categories and Gorenstein stable categories are established. Using these, the Gorensteinness of an algebra A and invariants with respect to recollements of the bounded Gorenstein derived category D^{b}_{gp}(A\mbox{-}{\rm mod}) of A are investigated. Specifically, the Gorensteinness of A is characterized in three ways: the existence of Auslander-Reiten triangles in D^{b}_{gp}(A\mbox{-}{\rm mod}); recollements of D^{b}_{gp}(A\mbox{-}{\rm mod}); and also Gorenstein derived equivalences. It is shown that the finiteness of Cohen-Macaulay type and of finitistic dimension are invariant with respect to the recollements of D^{b}_{gp}(A\mbox{-}{\rm mod}).
