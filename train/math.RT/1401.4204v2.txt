Let A be a virtually Gorenstein algebra of finite CM-type. We establish a duality between the subcategory of compact objects in the homotopy category of Gorenstein projective left A-modules and the bounded Gorenstein derived category of finitely generated right A-modules. Let R be a two-sided noetherian ring such that the subcategory of Gorenstein flat modules R\mbox{-}\mathcal{GF} is closed under direct products. We show that the inclusion K(R\mbox{-}\mathcal{GF})\to K(R\mbox{-}{\rm Mod}) of homotopy categories admits a right adjoint. We introduce the notion of Gorenstein representation dimension for an algebra of finite CM-type, and establish relations among the dimension of its relative Auslander algebra, Gorenstein representation dimension, the dimension of the bounded Gorenstein derived category, and the dimension of the bounded homotopy category of its Gorenstein projective modules.
