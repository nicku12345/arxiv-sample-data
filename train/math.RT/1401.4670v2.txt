In this paper, we consider the modules for the Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra and the W algebra W(2,2). We determine the modules whose restriction to the Cartan subalgebra (modulo center) are free of rank 1 for the two algebras. We also determine the simplicity of these modules. These modules provide new simple modules for the W algebra W(2,2).
