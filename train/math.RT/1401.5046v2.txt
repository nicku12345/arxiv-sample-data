Let A, B and C be associative rings with identity. Using a result of Koenig we show that if we have a \mathbb{D}^{{\rm{b}}}({\rm{{mod\mbox{-}}}} ) level recollement, writing A in terms of B and C, then we get a \mathbb{D}^-({\rm{Mod\mbox{-}}} ) level recollement of certain functor categories, induces from the module categories of A, B and C. As an application, we generalise the main theorem of Pan [Sh. Pan, Derived equivalences for Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebras, J. Pure Appl. Algebra, 216 (2012), 355-363] in terms of recollements of Gorenstein artin algebras. Moreover, we show that being Gorenstein as well as being of finite Cohen-Macaulay type, are invariants with respect to \mathbb{D}^{{\rm{b}}}_{{{\mathcal{G}p}}}({\rm{{mod\mbox{-}}}}) level recollements of virtually Gorenstein algebras, where \mathbb{D}^{{\rm{b}}}_{{{\mathcal{G}p}}} denotes the Gorenstein derived category.
