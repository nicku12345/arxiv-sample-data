We show that the generalized W-modules defined in a foregoing paper determine ZA_\infty- components in the Auslander-Reiten quiver \Gamma(n,r) of the generalized Beilinson algebra B(n,r), n \geq 3. These components entirely consist of modules with the constant Jordan type property. We arrive at this result by interpreting B(n,r) as an iterated one-point extension of the r-Kronecker algebra K_r which enables us to generalize findings concerning the Auslander-Reiten quiver \Gamma(K_r) presented in earlier work to B(n,r).
