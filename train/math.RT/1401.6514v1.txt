Let \mathscr{A} be a small abelian category. For a closed subbifunctor F of \Ext_{\mathscr{A}}^{1}(-,-), Buan has generalized the construction of the Verdier's quotient category to get a relative derived category, where he localized with respect to F-acyclic complexes. In this paper, the homological properties of relative derived categories are discussed, and the relation with derived categories is given. For Artin algebras, using relatively derived categories, we give a relative version on derived equivalences induced by F-tilting complexes. We discuss the relationships between relative homological dimensions and relative derived equivalences.
