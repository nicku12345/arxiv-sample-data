We present a criterion for multiplicity-freeness of the decomposition of the restriction Res^G_H(\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2) of the Kronecker product of two generic irreducible representations \rho_1, \rho_2 of a finite group G with respect to a subgroup H \leq G. This constitutes a generalization of a well known criterion due to Mackey (which corresponds to the case H = G). The corresponding harmonic analysis is illustated by detailed computations on the Clifford groups G={\mathbb{CL}}(n), together with the subgroups H={\mathbb{CL}}(n-1), for n \geq 1, which lead to an explicit decomposition of the restriction of Kronecker products.
