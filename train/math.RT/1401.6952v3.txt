In this paper we show that the derived Picard group TrPic(A) of the Brauer star algebra of type (n,t) is generated by shift, Pic(A) and equivalences \{H_i\}_{i=1}^n in the case t>1, where H_i were shown to satisfy the relations of the braid group on the affine diagram \widetilde{A}_{n-1} by Schaps and Zakay-Illouz. In the multiplicity free case we show that TrPic(A) is generated by a slightly bigger set.
