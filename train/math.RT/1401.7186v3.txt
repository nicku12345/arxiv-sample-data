In this paper we prove that the linear Koszul duality isomorphism for convolution algebras in K-homology defined in a previous paper and the Fourier transform isomorphism for convolution algebras in Borel-Moore homology are related by the Chern character. So, Koszul duality appears as a categorical upgrade of Fourier transform of constructible sheaves. This result explains the connection between the categorification of the Iwahori-Matsumoto involution for graded affine Hecke algebras (due to Evens and the first author) and for usual affine Hecke algebras (obtained in a previous paper).
