Given a finite group scheme \cG over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic \Char(k)=p>0, we introduce new invariants for a \cG-module M by associating certain morphisms \deg^j_M : U_M \lra \Gr_d(M) \ \ (1\!\le\!j\!\le\! p\!-\!1) to M that take values in Grassmannians of M. These maps are studied for two classes of finite algebraic groups, infinitesimal group schemes and elementary abelian group schemes. The maps associated to the so-called modules of constant j-rank have a well-defined degree ranging between 0 and j\rk^j(M), where \rk^j(M) is the generic j-rank of M. The extreme values are attained when the module M has the equal images property or the equal kernels property. We establish a formula linking the j-degrees of M and its dual M^\ast. For a self-dual module M of constant Jordan type this provides information concerning the indecomposable constituents of the pull-back \alpha^\ast(M) of M along a p-point \alpha : k[X]/(X^p) \lra k\cG.
