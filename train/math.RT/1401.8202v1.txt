Let G be a simple algebraic group of type E_6 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0. We determine the submodule structure of the Weyl modul es with highest weight r\omega_1 for 0\leq r\leq p-1, where \omega_1 is the fundamental weight of the standard 27-dimensional module. In the process, the structures of other Weyl modules with highest weights linked to r\omega_1 are also found. %We also give some computations for the Weyl modules with highest weights %of the form r(\omega_1+\omega_6), which arise in the study of %the graph automorphism and associated twisted finite groups.
