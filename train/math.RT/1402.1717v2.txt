We explicitly construct a finite number of discrete components in the restriction of complementary series representations of rank one semisimple groups G to rank one subgroups G_1. For this we use the realizations of complementary series representations of G and G_1 on Sobolev spaces on the nilpotent radicals N and N_1 of the minimal parabolics in G and G_1, respectively. The groups N and N_1 are of H-type and we construct explicitly invariant differential operators between N and N_1. These operators induce the projections onto the discrete components. Our construction of the invariant differential operators is carried out uniformly in the framework of H-type groups and also works for those H-type groups which do not occur as nilpotent radical of a parabolic subgroup in a semisimple group.
