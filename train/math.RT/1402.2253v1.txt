Let W be a complex reflection group of the form G(l,1,n). Following [BK12, BPW12, Gor06, GS05, GS06, KR08, MN11], the theory of deform quantising conical symplectic resolutions allows one to study the category of modules for the spherical Cherednik algebra, U_\textbf{c}(W), via a functor, \mathbb T_{\textbf{c},\theta}, which takes invariant global sections of certain twisted sheaves on some Nakajima quiver variety Y_\theta.   A parameter for the Cherednik algebra, \textbf{c}, is considered `good' if there exists a choice of GIT parameter \theta, such that \mathbb T_{\textbf{c},\theta} is exact and `bad' otherwise. By calculating the Kirwan--Ness strata for \theta=\pm(1,\ldots,1) and using criteria of [MN13], it is shown that the set of all bad parameters is bounded. The criteria are then used to show that, for the cases W=\mathfrak S_n, \mu_3, B_2, all parameters are good.
