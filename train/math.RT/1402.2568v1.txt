Inspired by the work of Benson, Carlson, Friedlander, Pevtsova, and Suslin on modules of constant Jordan type for finite group schemes, we introduce in this paper the class of representations of constant Jordan type for an acyclic quiver Q. We do this by first assigning to an arbitrary finite-dimensional representation of Q a sequence of coherent sheaves on moduli spaces of thin representations. Next, we show that our quiver representations of constant Jordan type are precisely those representations for which the corresponding sheaves are locally free. We also construct representations of constant Jordan type with desirable homological properties. Finally, we show that any element of \mathbb{Z}^L, where L is the Loewy length of the path algebra of Q, can be realized as the Jordan type of a virtual representation of Q of relative constant Jordan type.
