We consider the tensor product \pi_{\alpha}\otimes \pi_{\beta} of complementary series representations \pi_{\alpha} and \pi_{\beta} of classical rank one groups SO_0(n, 1), SU(n, 1) and Sp(n, 1). We prove that there is a discrete component \pi_{\alpha+\beta} for small parameters \alpha, \beta (in our parametrization). We prove further that for G=SO_0(n, 1) there are finitely many complementary series of the form \pi_{\alpha+\beta + 2j}, j=0, 1, \cdots, k, appearing in the tensor product \pi_{\alpha} \otimes \pi_{\beta}  of two complementary series \pi_{\alpha} and \pi_{\beta}, where k=k(\alpha, \beta, n) depends on \alpha, \beta, n.
