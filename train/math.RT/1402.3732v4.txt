Tensor triangular geometry as introduced by Balmer is a powerful idea which can be used to extract the ambient geometry from a given tensor triangulated category. In this paper we provide a general setting for a compactly generated tensor triangulated category which enables one to classify thick tensor ideals and the Balmer spectrum. For a classical Lie superalgebra {\mathfrak g}={\mathfrak g}_{\bar{0}}\oplus {\mathfrak g}_{\bar{1}}, we construct a Zariski space from a detecting subalgebra of {\mathfrak g} and demonstrate that this topological space governs the tensor triangular geometry for the category of finite dimensional {\mathfrak g}-modules which are semisimple over {\mathfrak g}_{\bar{0}}.
