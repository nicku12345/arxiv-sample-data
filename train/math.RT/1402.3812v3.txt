This article constructs the Satake parameter for any irreducible smooth J-spherical representation of a p-adic group, where J is any parahoric subgroup. This parametrizes such representations when J is a special maximal parahoric subgroup. The main novelty is for groups which are not quasi-split, and the construction should play a role in formulating a geometric Satake isomorphism for such groups over local function fields.
