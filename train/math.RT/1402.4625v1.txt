In this note, we consider the Lyndon--Hochschild--Serre spectral sequence corresponding to the first Frobenius kernel of an algebraic group G, computing the extensions between simple G-modules. We state and discuss a conjecture that E_2=E_\infty and provide general conditions for low-dimensional terms on the E_2-page to be the same as the corresponding terms on the E_{\infty}-page, i.e. its abutment.
