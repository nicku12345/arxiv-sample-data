Interchanging character and co-character groups of a torus T over a field k introduces a contravariant functor T \rightarrow \widehat{T}. Interpreting \rho:T\rightarrow {\mathbb C}^\times, half the sum of positive roots for T a maximal torus in a simply connected semi-simple group G (over {\mathbb C}) using this duality, we get a co-character \widehat{\rho}: {\mathbb C}^\times \rightarrow \widehat{T} whose value at e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{h}} (h the Coxeter number) is the Coxeter conjugacy class of the dual group \widehat{G}. This point of view gives a rather transparent proof of a theorem of Kostant on the character values of irreducible finite dimensional representations of G at the Coxeter element: the proof amounting to the fact that in \widehat{G}_{sc}, the simply connected cover of \widehat{G}, there is a unique regular conjugacy class whose image in \widehat{G} has order h (which is the Coxeter conjugacy class).
