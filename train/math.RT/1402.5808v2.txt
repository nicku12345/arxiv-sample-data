We introduce super-analogues of the Schur functors defined by Akin, Buchsbaum and Weyman. These {\em Schur superfunctors} may be viewed as characteristic-free analogues of the finite dimensional atypical irreducible modules over the Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{gl}(m|n) studied by Berele and Regev. Our construction realizes Schur superfunctors as objects of a certain category of strict polynomial superfunctors. We show that Schur superfunctors are indecomposable objects of this category. Another aim is to provide a decomposition of {\em Schur bisuperfunctors} in terms of tensor products of Schur superfunctors.
