Let \mathbb{X} be a weighted projective line and \operatorname{coh}\mathbb{X} the associated categoy of coherent sheaves. We classify the tilting complexes T in D^b(\operatorname{coh}\mathbb{X}) such that \tau^2 T\cong T, where \tau is the Auslander-Reiten translation in D^b(\operatorname{coh}\mathbb{X}). As an application of this result, we classify the 2-representation-finite algebras which are derived-equivalent to a canonical algebra. This complements Iyama-Oppermann's classification of the iterated tilted 2-representation-finite algebras. By passing to 3-preprojective algebras, we obtain a classification of the selfinjective cluster-tilted algebras of canonical-type. This complements Ringel's classification of the selfinjective cluster-tilted algebras.
