In this paper we give a geometric-combinatorial description of the cluster categories of type E. In particular, we give an explicit geometric description of all cluster tilting objects in the cluster category of type E_6. The model we propose here arises from combining two polygons, and it generalises the description of the cluster category of type A and D.
