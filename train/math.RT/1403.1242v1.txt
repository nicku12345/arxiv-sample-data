In this paper we study the vertices of indecomposable Specht modules for symmetric groups. For any given indecomposable non-projective Specht module, the main theorem of the article describes a family of p-subgroups contained in its vertex. The theorem generalizes and improves an earlier result due to Wildon in "Vertices of Specht modules and blocks of the symmetric group", J. Alg 323 (2010) 2243--2256.
