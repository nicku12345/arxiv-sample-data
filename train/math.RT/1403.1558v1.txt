We prove that there is a natural grading-preserving isomorphism of \sl-modules between the basic module of the affine Lie algebra \widehat\sl (with the homogeneous grading) and a Schur--Weyl module of the infinite symmetric group \sinf with a grading defined through the combinatorial notion of the major index of a Young tableau, and study the properties of this isomorphism. The results reveal new and deep interrelations between the representation theory of \widehat\sl and the Virasoro algebra on the one hand, and the representation theory of \sinf and the related combinatorics on the other hand.
