Given a torsion pair \mathbf{t} = (\mathcal{T} ;\mathcal{F}) in a module category R-Mod we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the associated Happel-Reiten-Smal\o \text{ } t-structure in \mathcal{D}(R) to have a heart \mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{t}} which is a module category. We also study when such a pair is given by a 2-term complex of projective modules in the way described by Hoshino-Kato-Miyachi ([HKM]). Among other consequences, we completely identify the hereditary torsion pairs \mathbf{t} for which \mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{t}} is a module category in the following cases: i) when \mathbf{t} is the left constituent of a TTF triple, showing that \mathbf{t} need not be HKM; ii) when \mathbf{t} is faithful; iii) when \mathbf{t} is arbitrary and the ring R is either commutative, semi-hereditary, local, perfect or Artinian. We also give a systematic way of constructing non-tilting torsion pairs for which the heart is a module category generated by a stalk complex at zero
