We present Bianchi's proof on the classification of real (and complex) 3-dimensional Lie algebras in a coordinate free version from a strictly representation theoretic point of view. Nearby we also compute the automorphism groups and from this the orbit dimensions of the corresponding orbits in the algebraic variety X\subseteq\Lambda^2V^*\otimes V describing all Lie brackets on a fixed vector space V of dimension 3. Moreover we clarify which orbits lie in the closure of a given orbit and therefore the topology on the orbit space X/G with G=\mathrm{Aut}(V).
