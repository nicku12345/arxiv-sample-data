I. Penkov and V. Serganova have recently introduced, for any non-degenerate pairing W\otimes V\to\mathbb C of vector spaces, the Lie algebra \mathfrak{gl}^M=\mathfrak{gl}^M(V,W) consisting of endomorphisms of V whose duals preserve W\subseteq V^*. In their work, the category \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{gl}^M} of \mathfrak{gl}^M-modules which are finite length subquotients of the tensor algebra T(W\otimes V) is singled out and studied. In this note we solve three problems posed by these authors concerning the categories \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{gl}^M}. Denoting by \mathbb{T}_{V\otimes W} the category with the same objects as \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{gl}^M} but regarded as V\otimes W-modules, we first show that when W and V are paired by dual bases, the functor \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{gl}^M}\to \mathbb{T}_{V\otimes W} taking a module to its largest weight submodule with respect to a sufficiently nice Cartan subalgebra of V\otimes W is a tensor equivalence. Secondly, we prove that when W and V are countable-dimensional, the objects of \mathbb{T}_{\mathrm{End}(V)} have finite length as \mathfrak{gl}^M-modules. Finally, under the same hypotheses, we compute the socle filtration of a simple object in \mathbb{T}_{\mathrm{End}(V)} as a \mathfrak{gl}^M-module.
