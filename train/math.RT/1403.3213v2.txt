Let \mathbf{c}_0 be the lowest generalized two-sided cell of an extended affine Weyl group W. We determine the structure of the based ring of \mathbf{c}_0. For this we show that certain conjectures of Lusztig on generalized cells (called P1-P15) hold for \mathbf{c}_0. As an application, we use the structure of the based ring to study certain simple modules of Hecke algebras of  W  with unequal parameters, namely those attached to \mathbf{c}_0.   Also we give a set of prime ideals \mathfrak{p} of the center \mathcal{Z} of the generic affine Hecke algebra \mathcal{H} such that the reduced affine Hecke algebra k_\mathfrak{p}\mathcal{H} is simple over k_\mathfrak{p}, where k_\mathfrak{p}=\rm{Frac}(\mathcal{Z}/\mathfrak{p}) is the residue field of \mathcal{Z} at \mathfrak{p}. In particular, we show that the algebra \mathcal{H}\otimes_\mathcal{Z}\rm{Frac}(\mathcal{Z}) is a split simple algebra over the field  \rm{Frac}(\mathcal{Z}).
