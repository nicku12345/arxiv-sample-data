We present a closed form for a multi-variate generating function for the dimensions of the irreducible representations of a semisimple, simply connected linear algebraic group over \mathbb{C} whose highest weights lie in a finitely generated lattice cone in the dominant chamber. This result generalizes the formula for the Hilbert series of an equivariant embedding of a homogeneous projective variety. As a special case, we show how the multi-variate series can be used to compute the Hilbert series of the determinantal varieties.
