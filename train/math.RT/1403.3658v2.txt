This article has two objectives. The first is to give a guide to the proof of the (so-called) Casselman-Wallach theorem as it appears in Real Reductive Groups II. The emphasis will be on one aspect of the original proof that leads to the new result in this paper which is the second objective. We show how a theorem of van der Noort combined with a clarification of the original argument in my book lead to a theorem with parameters (an alternative is one announced by Berstein and Kr\"otz). This result gives a new proof of the meromorphic continulation of the smooth Eisenstein series.
