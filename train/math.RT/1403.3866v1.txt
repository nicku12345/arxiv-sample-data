In this paper we study finite W-algebras for basic classical superalgebras and Q(n) associated to the regular even nilpotent coadjoint orbits. We prove that this algebra satisfies the Amitsur-Levitzki identity and therefore all its irreducible representations are finite-dimensional. In the case of Q(n) we give an explicit description of the W-algebra in terms of generators and relation and realize it as a quotient of the super-Yangian of Q(1).
