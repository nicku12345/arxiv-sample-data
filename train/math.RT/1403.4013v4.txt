The Iwahori-Hecke algebra \mathcal{H} of a Coxeter system (W,S) has a "standard basis" indexed by the elements of W and a "bar involution" given by a certain antilinear map. Together, these form an example of what Webster calls a pre-canonical structure, relative to which the well-known Kazhdan-Lusztig basis of \mathcal{H} is a canonical basis. Lusztig and Vogan have defined a representation of a modified Iwahori-Hecke algebra on the free \mathbb{Z}[v,v^{-1}]-module generated by the set of twisted involutions in W, and shown that this module has a unique pre-canonical structure satisfying a certain compatibility condition, which admits its own canonical basis which can be viewed as a generalization of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis. One can modify the parameters defining Lusztig and Vogan's module to obtain other pre-canonical structures, each of which admits a unique canonical basis indexed by twisted involutions. We classify all of the pre-canonical structures which arise in this fashion, and explain the relationships between their resulting canonical bases. While some of these canonical bases are related in a trivial fashion to Lusztig and Vogan's construction, others appear to have no simple relation to what has been previously studied. Along the way, we also clarify the differences between Webster's notion of a canonical basis and the related concepts of an IC basis and a P-kernel.
