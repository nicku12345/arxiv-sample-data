Given associative unital algebras A and B and a complex T^\bullet of B-A-bi\-modules, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the total derived functors, \Rh_A(T^\bullet,?):\D(A)\longrightarrow\D(B) and ?\Lt_BT^\bullet:\D(B)\longrightarrow\D(A), to be fully faithful. We also give criteria for these functors to be one of the fully faithful functors appearing in a recollement of derived categories. In the case when T^\bullet is just a B-A-bimodule, we connect the results with (infinite dimensional) tilting theory and show that some open question on the fully faithfulness of \Rh_A(T,?) is related to the classical Wakamatsu tilting problem.
