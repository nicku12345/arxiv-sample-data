Let E be a non-Archimedian local field of characteristic zero and residue characteristic p. Let {\bf G} be a connected reductive group defined over E and \pi an irreducible admissible representation of G={\bf G}(E). A result of C. M{\oe}glin and J.-L. Waldspurger (for p \neq 2) and S. Varma (for p=2) states that the leading coefficient in the character expansion of \pi at the identity element of {\bf G}(E) gives the dimension of a certain space of degenerate Whittaker forms. In this paper we generalize this result of M{\oe}glin-Waldspurger to the setting of covering groups \tilde{G} of G.
