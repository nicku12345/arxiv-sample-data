We prove the Alperin-McKay Conjecture for all p-blocks of finite groups with metacyclic, minimal non-abelian defect groups. These are precisely the metacyclic groups whose derived subgroup have order p. In the special case p=3, we also verify Alperin's Weight Conjecture for these defect groups. Moreover, in case p=5 we do the same for the non-abelian defect groups C_{25}\rtimes C_{5^n}. The proofs do not rely on the classification of the finite simple groups.
