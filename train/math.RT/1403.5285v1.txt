We develop the theory of global and local Weyl modules for the hyperspecial maximal parabolic subalgebra of type A_{2n}^{(2)}. We prove that the dimension of a local Weyl module depends only on its highest weight, thus establishing a freeness result for global Weyl modules. Furthermore, we show that the graded local Weyl modules are level one Demazure modules for the corresponding affine Lie algebra. In the last section we derive the same results for the special maximal parabolic subalgebras of the twisted affine Lie algebras not of type A_{2n}^{(2)}.
