Let H be a real algebraic group acting equivariantly with finitely many orbits on a real algebraic manifold X and a real algebraic bundle \mathcal{E} on X. Let \mathfrak{h} be the Lie algebra of H. Let \mathcal{S}(X,\mathcal{E}) be the space of Schwartz sections of \mathcal{E}. We prove that \mathfrak{h}\mathcal{S}(X,\mathcal{E}) is a closed subspace of \mathcal{S}(X,\mathcal{E}) of finite codimension.   We give an application of this result in the case when H is a real spherical subgroup of a real reductive group G. We deduce an equivalence of two old conjectures due to Casselman: the automatic continuity and the comparison conjecture for zero homology. Namely, let \pi be a Casselman-Wallach representation of G and V be the corresponding Harish-Chandra module. Then the natural morphism of coinvariants V_{\mathfrak{h}}\to \pi_{\mathfrak{h}} is an isomorphism if and only if any linear \mathfrak{h}-invariant functional on V is continuous in the topology induced from \pi. The latter statement is known to hold in two important special cases: if H includes a symmetric subgroup, and if H includes the nilradical of a minimal parabolic subgroup of G.
