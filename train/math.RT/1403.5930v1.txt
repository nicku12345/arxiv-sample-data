Let \Lambda be a finite-dimensional basic algebra over an algebraically closed field k. The well-known Drozd's theorem asserts, that \Lambda is either tame or wild. The Crawley-Boevey's Theorem states that for a given tame algebra \Lambda, and for each dimension d almost all isomorphism classes of indecomposable \Lambda-modules of dimension d are isomorphic to their Auslander-Reiten translations and hence belong to homogeneous tubes. In this paper we prove the converse of Crawley-Boevey's Theorem and thus give an internal description of tameness in terms of AR-quivers. This gives a complete answer to a question posed by Ringel in \cite{R1}.
