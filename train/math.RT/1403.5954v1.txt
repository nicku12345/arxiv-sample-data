In this paper we introduce generalized pseudo-quadratic forms and develope some theory for them. Recall that the codomain of a (\sigma,\varepsilon)-quadratic form is the group \overline{K} := K/K_{\sigma,\varepsilon}, where K is the underlying division ring of the vector space on which the form is defined and K_{\sigma,\varepsilon} := \{t-t^\sigma\varepsilon\}_{t\in K}. Generalized pseudo-quadratic forms are defined in the same way as (\sigma,\varepsilon)-quadratic forms but for replacing \overline{K} with a quotient \overline{K}/\overline{R} for a subgroup \overline{R} of \overline{K} such that \lambda^\sigma\overline{R}\lambda = \overline{R} for any \lambda\in K. In particular, every non-trivial generalized pseudo-quadratic form admits a unique sesquilinearization, characterized by the same property as the sesquilinearization of a pseudo-quadratic form. Moreover, if q:V\rightarrow \overline{K}/\overline{R} is a non-trivial generalized pseudo-quadratic form and f:V\times V\rightarrow K is its sesquilinarization, the points and the lines of \mathrm{PG}(V) where q vanishes form a subspace S_q of the polar space S_f associated to f. After a discussion of quotients and covers of generalized pseudo-quadratic forms we prove the following: let e:S\rightarrow \mathrm{PG}(V) be a projective embedding of a non-degenerate polar space S of rank at least 2; then e(S) is either the polar space S_q associated to a generalized pseudo-quadratic form q or the polar space S_f associated to an alternating form f. By exploiting this theorem we also obtain an elementary proof of the following well known fact: an embedding e as above is dominant if and only if either e(S) = S_q for a pseudo-quadratic form q or \mathrm{char}(K)\neq 2 and e(S) = S_f for an alternating form f.
