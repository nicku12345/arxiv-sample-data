In this paper we extend the computations in parts I and II of this series of papers and complete the proof of a conjecture of Lehrer and Solomon expressing the character of a finite Coxeter group W acting on the pth graded component of its Orlik-Solomon algebra as a sum of characters induced from linear characters of centralizers of elements of W for groups of rank seven and eight. For classical Coxeter groups, these characters are given using a formula that is expected to hold in all ranks.
