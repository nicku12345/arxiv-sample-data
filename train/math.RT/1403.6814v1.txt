Over any field of positive characteristic we construct 2-CY-tilted algebras that are not Jacobian algebras of quivers with potentials. As a remedy, we propose an extension of the notion of a potential, called hyperpotential, that allows to prove that certain algebras defined over fields of positive characteristic are 2-CY-tilted even if they do not arise from potentials.   In another direction, we compute the fractionally Calabi-Yau dimensions of certain orbit categories of fractionally CY triangulated categories. As an application, we construct a cluster category of type G_2.
