The n-dimensional projective group gives rise to a one-parameter family of inhomogeneous first-order differential operator representations of sl(n+1). By partially swapping differential operators and multiplication operators, we obtain more general differential operator representations of sl(n+1). Letting these differential operators act on the corresponding polynomial algebra and the space of exponential-polynomial functions, we construct new multi-parameter families of explicit infinite-dimensional irreducible representations for s(n+1) and sp(2m+2) when n=2m+1. Our results can be viewed as extensions of Howe's oscillator construction of infinite-dimensional multiplicity-free irreducible representations for sl(n).
