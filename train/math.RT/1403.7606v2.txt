Assume \mathbf{G} is a connected reductive algebraic group defined over an algebraic closure \mathbb{K} = \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p of the finite field of prime order p>0. Furthermore, assume that F : \mathbf{G} \to \mathbf{G} is a Frobenius endomorphism of \mathbf{G}. In this article we give a formula for the value of any F-stable character sheaf of \mathbf{G} at a unipotent element. This formula is expressed in terms of class functions of \mathbf{G}^F which are supported on a single unipotent class of \mathbf{G}. In general these functions are not determined, however we give an expression for these functions under the assumption that Z(\mathbf{G}) is connected, \mathbf{G}/Z(\mathbf{G}) is simple and p is a good prime for \mathbf{G}. In this case our formula is completely explicit.
