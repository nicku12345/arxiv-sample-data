Let  \pi  be an irreducible Harish-Chandra  (\mathfrak{g}, K) -module, and denote its associated variety by  AV(\pi) . If  AV(\pi)  is reducible, then each irreducible component must contain codimension one boundary component. Thus we are interested in the codimension one adjacency of nilpotent orbits for a symmetric pair  (G, K) . We define the notion of orbit graph and associated graph for  \pi , and study its structure for classical symmetric pairs; number of vertices, edges, connected components, etc. As a result, we prove that the orbit graph is connecetd for even nilpotent orbits.   Finally, for indefinite unitary group  U(p, q) , we prove that for each connected component of the orbit graph  \Gamma_K(O_{\lambda})  thus defined, there is an irreducible Harish-Chandra module  \pi  whose associated graph is exactly equal to the connceted component.
