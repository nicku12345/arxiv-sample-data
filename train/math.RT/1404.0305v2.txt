We give a classification of all irreducible completely pointed U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}) modules over a characteristic zero field in which q is not a root of unity. This generalizes the classification result of Benkart, Britten and Lemire in the non quantum case. We also show that any infinite-dimensional irreducible completely pointed U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}) can be obtained from some irreducible completely pointed module over the quantized Weyl algebra A_{n+1}^q.
