We construct a modular generalized Springer correspondence for any classical group, by generalizing to the modular setting various results of Lusztig in the case of characteristic-0 coefficients. We determine the cuspidal pairs in all classical types, and compute the correspondence explicitly for \mathrm{SL}(n) with coefficients of arbitrary characteristic and for \mathrm{SO}(n) and \mathrm{Sp}(2n) with characteristic-2 coefficients.
