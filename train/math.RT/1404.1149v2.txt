Let (\mathfrak{g},[p]) be a finite-dimensional restricted Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field \mathbb{K} of characteristic p>0, and G be the adjoint group of \mathfrak{g}. We say that \mathfrak{g} satisfying the {\sl generic property} if \mathfrak{g} admits generic tori introduced in \cite{BFS}. A Borel subalgebra (or Borel for short) of \mathfrak{g} is by definition a maximal solvable subalgebra containing a maximal torus of \mathfrak{g}, which is further called generic if additionally containing a generic torus. In this paper, we first settle a conjecture proposed by Premet in \cite{Pr2} on regular Cartan subalgebras of restricted Lie algebras. We prove that the statement in the conjecture for a given \mathfrak{g} is valid if and only if it is the case when \mathfrak{g} satisfies the generic property. We then classify the conjugay classes of homogeneous Borel subalgebras of the restricted simple Lie algebras \mathfrak{g}=W(n) under G-conjugation when p>3, and present the representatives of these classes. Here W(n) is the so-called Jacobson-Witt algebra, by definition the derivation algebra of the truncated polynomial ring \mathbb{K}[T_1,\cdots,T_n]\slash (T_1^p,\cdots,T_n^p). We also describe the closed connected solvable subgroups of G associated with those representative Borel subalgebras.
