Yiannis Sakellaridis and Akshay Venkathesh have determined, when the group G is split and the field \F is of characteristic zero, the Plancherel formula for any spherical space X for G modulo the knowledge of the discrete spectrum.   The starting point is the determination of good neighborhoods at infinity of X/J, where J is a small compact open subgroup of G. These neighborhoods are related to "boundary degenerations" of X. The proof of their existence is made by using wonderful compactifications.   In this article we will show the existence of such neighborhoods assuming that \F is of characteristic different from 2 and X is symmetric. In particular, one does not assume that G is split. Our main tools are the Cartan decomposition of Benoist and Oh, our previous definition of the constant term and asymptotic properties of Eisenstein integrals due to Nathalie Lagier .   Once the existence of these neighborhoods at infinity of X is established, the analog of the work of Sakellaridis and Venkatesh is straightforward and leads to the Plancherel formula for X.
