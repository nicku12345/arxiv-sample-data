We calculate the dimensions of the Hochschild cohomology groups of a self-injective special biserial algebra \Lambda_{s} obtained by a circular quiver with double arrows. Moreover, we give a presentation of the Hochschild cohomology ring modulo nilpotence of \Lambda_{s} by generators and relations. This result shows that the Hochschild cohomology ring modulo nilpotence of \Lambda_{s} is finitely generated as an algebra.
