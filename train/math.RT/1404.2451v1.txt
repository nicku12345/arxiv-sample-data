Let A be a Nakayama algebra. We give a description of the singularity category of A inside its stable module category. We prove that there is a duality between the singularity category of A and the singularity category of its opposite algebra. As a consequence, the resolution quiver of A and the resolution quiver of its opposite algebra have the same number of cycles and the same number of cyclic vertices.
