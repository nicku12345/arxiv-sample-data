We prove vanishing of distribution on p-adic spherical spaces that are equivariant with respect to a generic character of the nilradical of a Borel subgroup and satisfy a certain condition on the wave-front set. We deduce from this non-vanishing of spherical Bessel functions for Galois symmetric pairs.
