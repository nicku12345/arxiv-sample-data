Let n be a positive integer, and let \mathscr{H}_n denote the affine KLR algebra in type A. Kleshchev, Mathas and Ram have given a homogeneous presentation for graded column Specht modules \operatorname{S}_{\lambda} for \mathscr{H}_n. Given two multipartitions \lambda and \mu, we define the notion of a \emph{dominated} homomorphism \operatorname{S}_{\lambda}\to\operatorname{S}_{\mu}, and use the KMR presentation to prove a generalised column removal theorem for graded dominated homomorphisms between Specht modules. In the process, we prove some useful properties of \mathscr{H}_n-homomorphisms between Specht modules which lead to an immediate corollary that, subject to a few demonstrably necessary conditions, every homomorphism \operatorname{S}_{\lambda}\to\operatorname{S}_{\mu} is dominated, and in particular \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{H}_n}(\operatorname{S}_{\lambda},\operatorname{S}_{\mu})=0 unless \lambda dominates \mu.   Brundan and Kleshchev show that certain cyclotomic quotients of \mathscr{H}_n are isomorphic to (degenerate) cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type A. Via this isomorphism, our results can be seen as a broad generalisation of the column removal results of Fayers and Lyle and of Lyle and Mathas; generalising both into arbitrary level and into the graded setting.
