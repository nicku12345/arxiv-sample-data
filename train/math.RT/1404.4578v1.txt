We study the indecomposable summands of the permutation module obtained by inducing the trivial \mathbb{F}(S_a\wr S_n)-module to the full symmetric group S_{an} for any field \mathbb{F} of odd prime characteristic p such that a<p\leq n. In particular we characterize the vertices of such indecomposable summands. As a corollary we will disprove a modular version of Foulkes' Conjecture.   In the second part of the article we will use this information to give a new description of some columns of the decomposition matrices of symmetric groups in terms of the ordinary character of the Foulkes module \phi^{(a^n)}.
