In this paper, we use the stable categories of some selfinjective algebras to describe the singularity categories of the cluster-tilted algebras of Dynkin type. Furthermore, in this way, we settle the problem of singularity equivalence classification of the cluster-tilted algebra of type A, D and E respectively.
