The properties of the preprojective algebra are very di fferent whether the associated quiver is of Dynkin type or not. However in both cases, one can construct from it a triangulated category of Calabi-Yau dimension 2. In this note we explain the generalizations of this fact in the context of higher preprojective algebra, and we give some homological properties that characterize preprojective algebras.
