Let G be a connected, reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field k of prime characteristic p and \mathfrak{g}=Lie(G). In this paper, we study representations of \mathfrak{g} with a p-character \chi of standard Levi form. When \mathfrak{g} is of type A_n, B_n, C_n or D_n, a sufficient condition for the irreducibility of standard parabolic baby Verma \mathfrak{g}-modules is obtained. This partially answers a question raised by Friedlander and Parshall in [Friedlander E. M. and Parshall B. J., Deformations of Lie algebra representations, Amer. J. Math. 112 (1990), 375-395]. Moreover, as an application, in the special case that \mathfrak{g} is of type A_n or B_n, and \chi lies in the sub-regular nilpotent orbit, we recover a result of Jantzen in [Jantzen J. C., Subregular nilpotent representations of sl_n and so_{2n+1}, Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 126 (1999), 223-257].
