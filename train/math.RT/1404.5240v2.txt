The affine Yangian of \mathfrak{gl}_1 has recently appeared simultaneously in the work of Maulik-Okounkov and Schiffmann-Vasserot in connection with the Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa conjecture. While the former presentation is purely geometric, the latter algebraic presentation is quite involved. In this article, we provide a simple loop realization of this algebra which can be viewed as an "additivization" of the quantum toroidal algebra of \mathfrak{gl}_1 in the same way as the Yangian Y_h(\mathfrak{g}) is an "additivization" of the quantum loop algebra U_q(L\mathfrak{g}) for a simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. We also explain the similarity between the representation theories of the affine Yangian and the quantum toroidal algebras of \mathfrak{gl}_1 by generalizing the milestone result of Gautam and Toledano Laredo to the current settings.
