The affine oriented Brauer category is a monoidal category obtained from the oriented Brauer category (= the free symmetric monoidal category generated by a single object and its dual) by adjoining a polynomial generator subject to appropriate relations. In this article, we prove a basis theorem for the morphism spaces in this category, as well as for all of its cyclotomic quotients.
