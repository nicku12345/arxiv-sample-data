Given a simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} and an element \mu\in\mathfrak{g}^*, the corresponding shift of argument subalgebra of \text{S}(\mathfrak{g}) is Poisson commutative. In the case where \mu is regular, this subalgebra is known to admit a quantization, that is, it can be lifted to a commutative subalgebra of \text{U}(\mathfrak{g}). We show that if \mathfrak{g} is of type A, then this property extends to arbitrary \mu, thus proving a conjecture of Feigin, Frenkel and Toledano Laredo. The proof relies on an explicit construction of generators of the center of the affine vertex algebra at the critical level.
