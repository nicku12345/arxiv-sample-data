The general linear group has two components and its the identity component, which consists of the real matrices with positive determinant and the set of all matrices with negative determinant. Since the general linear group is a two copies of the group of the identity component, so the general affine group. Consider the affine group, which is the semidirect product of the identity component with the real group of dimension. In this paper we generalize the Fourier transform to obtain the Plancherel theorem on this group and then, we establish the Plancherel theorem for the general affine group
