Given a tagged triangulation of a once-punctured polygon P^* with n vertices, we associate an ice quiver with potential such that the frozen part of the associated frozen Jacobian algebra has the structure of a Gorenstein K[X]-order \Lambda. Then we show that the stable category of the category of Cohen-Macaulay \Lambda-modules is equivalent to the cluster category \mathcal{C} of type D_n. It gives a natural interpretation of the usual indexation of cluster tilting objects of \mathcal{C} by tagged triangulations of P^*. Moreover, it extends naturally the triangulated categorification by \mathcal{C} of the cluster algebra of type D_n to an exact categorification by adding coefficients corresponding to the sides of P. Finally, we lift the previous equivalence of categories to an equivalence between the stable category of graded Cohen-Macaulay \Lambda-modules and the bounded derived category of modules over a path algebra of type D_n.
