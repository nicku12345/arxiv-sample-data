In this paper we address the problem of classification of simple weight modules over weak generalized Weyl algebras of rank one. The principal difference between weak generalized Weyl algebras and generalized weight algebras is that weak generalized Weyl algebras are defined using an endomorphism rather than an automorphism of a commutative ring R. We reduce classification of simple weight modules over weak generalized Weyl algebras to description of the dynamics of the action of the above mentioned endomorphism on the set of maximal ideals. We also describe applications of our results to the study of generalized Heisenberg algebras.
