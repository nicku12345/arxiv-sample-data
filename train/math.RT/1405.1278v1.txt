If f is an idempotent in a ring \Lambda, then we find sufficient \linebreak conditions which imply that the cohomology rings \oplus_{n\ge 0}Ext^n_{\Lambda}(\Lambda/{\br},\Lambda/{\br}) and \linebreak \oplus_{n\ge 0}Ext^n_{f\Lambda f}(f\Lambda f/f{\br} f,f\Lambda f/f{\br} f) are eventually isomorphic. This result allows us to compare finite generation and GK dimension of the cohomology rings \Lambda and f\Lambda f. We are also able to compare the global dimensions of \Lambda and f\Lambda f.
