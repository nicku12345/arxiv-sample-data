We introduce the notion of dual perfect bases and dual perfect graphs. We show that every integrable highest weight module V_q(\lambda) over a quantum generalized Kac-Moody algebra U_{q}(\mathcal{g}) has a dual perfect basis and its dual perfect graph is isomorphic to the crystal B(\lambda). We also show that the negative half U_{q}^{-}(\mathcal{g}) has a dual perfect basis whose dual perfect graph is isomorphic to the crystal B(\infty). More generally, we prove that all the dual perfect graphs of a given dual perfect space are isomorphic as abstract crystals. Finally, we show that the isomorphism classes of finitely generated graded projective indecomposable modules over a Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebra and its cyclotomic quotients form dual perfect bases for their Grothendieck groups.
