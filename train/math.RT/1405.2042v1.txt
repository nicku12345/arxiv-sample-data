In this paper we consider symmetric powers representation and exterior powers representation of finite groups, which generated by the representation which has finite dimension over the complex field. We calculate the multiplicity of irreducible component of two representations of some representation by using a character theory of representation and a pre-lambda-ring, for example, the regular representation.
