We consider a dual pair (G,G'), in the sense of Howe, with G compact acting on L^2(\mathbb R^n) for an appropriate n via the Weil Representation. Let \widetilde{G} be the preimage of G in the metaplectic group. Given a genuine irreducible unitary representation \Pi of \widetilde{G} we compute the Weyl symbol of orthogonal projection onto L^2(\mathbb R^n)_\Pi, the \Pi-isotypic component. We apply the result to obtain an explicit formula for the character of the corresponding irreducible unitary representation \Pi' of \widetilde{G'} and to compute of the wave front set of \Pi' by elementary means.
