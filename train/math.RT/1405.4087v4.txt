For a finite acyclic quiver Q and the corresponding preprojective algebra \Pi, we study the factor algebra \Pi_w associated with a element w in the Coxeter group introduced by Buan-Iyama-Reiten-Scott. The algebra \Pi_w has a natural \mathbb{Z}-grading, and we prove that \underline{\mathsf{Sub}}^{\mathbb{Z}}\Pi_w has a tilting object M. Moreover, we show that the endomorphism algebra of M is isomorphic to the stable Auslander algebra of a certain torsion free class of \mathsf{mod}\,kQ.
