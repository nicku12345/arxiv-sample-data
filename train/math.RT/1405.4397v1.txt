The classification of the Lie point symmetries of the nonlinear filtration equation gives the generic case and three special cases. By restricting to a special class of functions, we show that the Lie symmetries of the nonlinear filtration equation exponentiate to a global action of a solvable Lie group in the generic case and two of the three special cases. We show that the action of the Lie point symmetries cannot be globalized for the third special case.
