In previous work, the authors introduced the notion of Q-Koszul algebras, as a tool to "model" module categories for semisimple algebraic groups over fields of large characteristics. Here we suggest the model extends to small characteristics as well. In particular, we present several conjectures in the modular representation theory of semisimple groups which these algebras inspire. They provide a new world-view of modular representation theory, potentially valid for some root systems in all characteristics. In fact, we give a non-trivial example in which p=2. This paper begins a systematic study of Q-Koszul algebras, viewed as interesting objects in their own right.
