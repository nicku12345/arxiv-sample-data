We studied the positive representations P_\lambda of split real quantum groups U_{q\tilde{q}}(g_R) restricted to the Borel subalgebra U_{q\tilde{q}}(b_R). We proved that the restriction is independent of the parameter \lambda. Furthermore, we prove that it can be constructed from the GNS-representation of the multiplier Hopf algebra U_{q\tilde{q}}^{C^*}(b_R) constructed earlier, which enables us to decompose their tensor product using the theory of the "multiplicative unitary". This will be an essential ingredient in the construction of quantum higher Teichm\"{u}ller theory from the perspective of representation theory, generalizing earlier work by Frenkel-Kim.
