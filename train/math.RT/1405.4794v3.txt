Let (W,S) be a finite Coxeter group. Kazhdan and Lusztig introduced the concept of W-graphs and Gyoja proved that every irreducible representation of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra H(W,S) can be realized as a W-graph. Gyoja defined an auxiliary algebra for this purpose which -- to the author's best knowledge -- was never explicitly mentioned again in the literature after Gyoja's proof (although the underlying ideas were reused). The purpose of this paper is to resurrect this W-graph algebra and study its structure and its modules. A new explicit description of it as a quotient of a certain path algebra is given. A general conjecture is proposed that -- if it turns out to be true -- would imply strong restrictions on the structure of W-graphs. This conjecture is then proven for Coxeter groups of type I_2(m), B_3 and A_1 -- A_4.
