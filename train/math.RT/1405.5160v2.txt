Let G be a reductive algebraic group with a Borel subgroup B. We define the quasi-coherent Hecke category for the pair (G,B). For any regular Noetherian G-scheme X we construct a monoidal action of the Hecke category on the derived category of B-equivariant quasi-coherent sheaves on X. Using the action we define the Demazure Descent Data on the latter category and prove that the Descent category is equivalent to the derived category of G-equivariant sheaves on X.
