Let k be an algebraically closed field and A be a (left and right) Noetherian associative k-algebra. Assume further that A is either positively graded or semiperfect (this includes the class of finite dimensional k-algebras, and k-algebras that are finitely generated modules over a Noetherian central Henselian ring). Let e be a primitive idempotent of A, which we assume is of degree 0 if A is positively graded. We consider the idempotent subalgebra \Gamma = (1-e)A(1-e) and S_e the simple right A-module S_e = eA/e{\rm rad}A, where {\rm rad}A is the Jacobson radical of A, or the graded Jacobson radical of A if A is positively graded. In this paper, we relate the homological dimensions of A and \Gamma, using the homological properties of S_e. First, if S_e has no self-extensions of any degree, then the global dimension of A is finite if and only if that of \Gamma is. On the other hand, if the global dimensions of both A and \Gamma are finite, then S_e cannot have self-extensions of degree greater than one, provided A/{\rm rad}A is finite dimensional.
