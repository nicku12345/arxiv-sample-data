Let K/F be a quadratic extension of non archimedean local fields. Let V be an irreducible level zero discrete series representation of the group G = GL2(R), where R is a division algebra of center K and of index r. One assumes that V is not a supercuspidal representation. Let D be a division algebra of center F and index 2r. In the following work, we try to answer this question : Is the representation V D^{*}-distinguished if and only if its image by the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence is GL2(F)-distinguished. To answer this question, we use the coefficients system on the Bruhat-Tits building of G associated to the representation V by P. Schneider and U. Stuhler and the parametrization of level zero discrete series representation given by J. Silberger and E. W. Zink.
