In this note we prove a certain multiplicity formula regarding the restriction of an irreducible admissible genuine representation of a 2-fold cover \widetilde{{\rm GL}}_{2}(E) of {\rm GL}_{2}(E) to the 2-fold cover \widetilde{{\rm SL}}_{2}(E) of {\rm SL}_{2}(E), and find in particular that this multiplicity may not be one, a result that seems to have been noticed before. The proofs follow the standard path via Waldspurger's analysis of theta correspondence between \widetilde{{\rm SL}}_{2}(E) and {\rm PGL}_{2}(E).
