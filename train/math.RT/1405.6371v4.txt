Let G be a split p-adic reductive group with connected centre and simply connected derived subgroup. We show that certain "chains" of principal series of G do not exist and we establish several properties of the Breuil-Herzig construction \Pi(\rho)^\mathrm{ord}. In particular, we obtain a natural characterization of the latter and we prove a conjecture of Breuil-Herzig. In order to do so, we partially compute Emerton's \delta-functor \mathrm{H^\bullet Ord}_P of derived ordinary parts with respect to a parabolic subgroup on a principal series. We formulate a new conjecture on the extensions between smooth mod p representations of G parabolically induced from supersingular representations of Levi subgroups of G and we prove it in the case of extensions by a principal series.
