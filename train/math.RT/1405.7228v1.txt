This paper was motivated by a remarkable group, the maximal subgroup M=S_3\ltimes 2^{2+1}_{-}\ltimes3^{2+1}\ltimes2^{6+1}_{-} of the sporadic simple group {\rm Fi}_{23}, where S_3 is the symmetric group of degree 3, and 2^{2+1}_{-}, 3^{2+1} and 2^{6+1}_{-} denote extraspecial groups. The representation 3^{2+1}\to{\rm GL}(3,\mathbb{F}_4)\to{\rm GL}(6,\mathbb{F}_2) extends (remarkably) to S_3\ltimes 2^{2+1}_{-}\ltimes3^{2+1} and preserves a quadratic form (of minus type) which allows the construction of M. The paper describes certain (Weil) representations of extraspecial groups which extend, and preserve various forms. Incidentally, M is a remarkable solvable group with derived length 10, and composition length 24.
