In recent years different aspects of categorification of the boson-fermion correspondence have been studied. In this paper we propose a categorification of the boson-fermion correspondence based on the category of tensor modules of the Lie algebra sl(\infty) of finitary infinite matrices. By \mathbb T^+ we denote the category of "polynomial" tensor sl(\infty)-modules. There is a natural "creation" functor \mathcal T_N: \mathbb T^+\to \mathbb T^+, M\mapsto N\otimes M,\quad M,N\in \mathbb T^+. The key idea of the paper is to employ the entire category \mathbb T of tensor sl(\infty)-modules in order to define the "annihilation" functor \mathcal D_N: \mathbb T^+\to \mathbb T^+ corresponding to \mathcal T_N. We show that the relations allowing to express fermions via bosons arise from relations in the cohomology of complexes of linear endofunctors on \mathbb T^+.
