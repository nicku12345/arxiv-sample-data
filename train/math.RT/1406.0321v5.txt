We define and study cohomological tensor functors from the category T_n of finite-dimensional representations of the supergroup Gl(n|n) into T_{n-r} for 0 <r \leq n. In the case DS: T_n \to T_{n-1} we prove a formula DS(L) = \bigoplus \Pi^{n_i} L_i for the image of an arbitrary irreducible representation. In particular DS(L) is semisimple and multiplicity free. We derive a few applications of this theorem such as the degeneration of certain spectral sequences and a formula for the modified superdimension of an irreducible representation.
