We will revisit Wiedemann's classification of Auslander-Reiten quivers of representation-finite Gorenstein orders in this paper. We give a simpler proof of his result in which he described the Auslander-Reiten quiver of a representation-finite Gorenstein order in terms of a Dynkin diagram, a configuration and an automorphism group. A key notion in his result is configurations described in terms of Brauer relations with so-called Stra{\ss}eneigenschaft. We show that configurations can be described in terms of 2-Brauer relations very briefly.
