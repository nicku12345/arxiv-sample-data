Let \CC^0_{\g} be the category of finite-dimensional integrable modules over the quantum affine algebra U_{q}'(\g) and let R^{A_\infty}\gmod denote the category of finite-dimensional graded modules over the quiver Hecke algebra of type A_{\infty}. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the categories \CC^0_{A_{N-1}^{(1)}} and \CC^0_{A_{N-1}^{(2)}} by constructing the generalized quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality functors \F^{(t)} from R^{A_\infty}\gmod to \CC^0_{A_{N-1}^{(t)}} (t=1,2).
