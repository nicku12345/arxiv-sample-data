We study the structure of parabolic inductions of a pro-p-Iwahori Hecke algebra. In particular, we give a classification of irreducible modulo p representations of pro-p-Iwahori Hecke algebra in terms of supersingular representations. Since supersingular representations are classified by Ollivier and Vigneras, it completes the classification of irreducible modulo p representations.
