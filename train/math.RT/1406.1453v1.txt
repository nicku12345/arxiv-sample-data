Let \mathfrak g be a complex semisimple Lie algebra. We obtain new properties of the q-analogue of weight multiplicities in finite-dimensional representations of \mathfrak g. In particular, it is proved that certain weighted sum of q-analogues of all weights of a representation V equals the q-analogue of the zero weight multiplicity in the reducible representation V\otimes V^*. This also provides another formula for the \mathbb Z[q]-valued symmetric bilinear form on the character ring of \mathfrak g that was introduced by R.Gupta (Brylinski) in 1987.
