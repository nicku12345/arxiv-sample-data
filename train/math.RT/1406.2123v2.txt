Inspired by the works of Rickard on splendid equivalences and of Chuang and Rouquier on perverse equivalences, we are here interested in the combination of both, a splendid perverse equivalence. This is naturally the right framework to understand the relations between global and local perverse equivalences between blocks of finite groups, as a splendid equivalence induces local derived equivalences via the Brauer functor. We prove that under certain conditions, we have an equivalence between a perverse equivalence between the homotopy category of p-permutation modules and local derived perverse equivalences, in the case of abelian defect group.
