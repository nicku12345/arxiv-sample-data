A linkage diagram is obtained from the Carter diagram \Gamma by adding an extra root \gamma, so that the resulting subset of roots is linearly independent. With every linkage diagram we associate the linkage label vector \gamma^{\nabla}, similar to Dynkin labels. The linkage diagrams connected under the action of the group W^{\vee}_{S} constitute the the linkage system \mathscr{L}(\Gamma). For any simply-laced Carter diagram, the system \mathscr{L}(\Gamma) is constructed. To obtain linkage diagrams \theta^{\nabla}, we use an easily verifiable criterion: \mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma}(\theta^{\nabla}) < 2, where \mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma} is the inverse quadratic form associated with \Gamma. A Dynkin diagram \Gamma' such that rank(\Gamma') = rank(\Gamma) + 1 and any \Gamma-associated root subset S lies in \varPhi(\Gamma'), is said to be the Dynkin extension. The linkage system \mathscr{L}(\Gamma) is the union of \Gamma_i-components \mathscr{L}_{\Gamma_i}(\Gamma) taken for all Dynkin extensions of \Gamma <_D \Gamma_i. The subset \varPhi(S) of roots of \varPhi(\Gamma'), linearly dependent on roots of S is said to be a partial root system. The size of \mathscr{L}_{\Gamma'}(\Gamma) is estimated as follows: |\mathscr{L}_{\Gamma'}(\Gamma)| \leq |\varPhi(\Gamma')| - |\varPhi(S)|. Carter diagrams E_l and E_l(a_i) (resp. D_l and D_l(a_k)) are said to be covalent. For any pair {\Gamma, \widetilde\Gamma} of covalent Carter diagrams, where \Gamma is the Dynkin diagram, we explicitly construct the invertible linear map M : \mathcal{P} \longrightarrow \mathcal{R}, where \mathcal{R} (resp. \mathcal{P}) is the root system (resp. partial root system) corresponding to \Gamma (resp. \widetilde\Gamma). In particular, we have |\mathscr{L}(\widetilde\Gamma)| = |\mathscr{L}(\Gamma)|.
