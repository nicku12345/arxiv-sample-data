We study the role of the mirabolic subgroup P of G=\mathbf{GL}_n(F) (F a p-adic field) in smooth irreducible representations of G that possess a non-zero invariant functional relative to a subgroup of the form H_{k} = \mathbf{GL}_k(F)\times \mathbf{GL}_{n-k}(F). We show that if a non-zero H_1-invariant functional exists on a representation, then every P\cap H_1-invariant functional must equal to a scalar multiple of it. When k>1, we give a reduction of the same problem to a question about invariant distributions on the nilpotent cone of the tangent space of the symmetric space G/H_k. Some new distributional methods, which are suitable for a setting of non-reductive groups, are developed.
