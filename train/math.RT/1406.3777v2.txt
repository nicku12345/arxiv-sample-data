The Mischenko-Fomenko argument shift method allows to construct commutative subalgebras in the symmetric algebra S(\mathfrak g) of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra \mathfrak g. For a wide class of Lie algebras, these commutative subalgebras appear to be complete, i.e. they have maximal transcendence degree. However, for many algebras, Mischenko-Fomenko subalgebras are incomplete or even empty. In this case, we suggest a natural way how to extend Mischenko-Fomenko subalgebras, and give a completeness criterion for these extended subalgebras.
