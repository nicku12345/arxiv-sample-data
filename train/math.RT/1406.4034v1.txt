We consider two non-degenerate potentials for the quiver arising from the once-punctured torus, which are a natural choice to study and compare: the first is the Labardini-potential, yielding a finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra, whereas the second potential gives rise to an infinite dimensional Jacobian algebra. In this paper we determine the graph of strongly reduced components for both Jacobian algebras. Our main result is that the graph is connected in both cases. Plamondon parametrized the strongly reduced components for finite-dimensional algebras using generic g-vectors. We prove that the generic g-vectors of indecomposable strongly reduced components of the finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra are precisely the universal geometric coefficients for the once-punctured torus, which were determined by Reading.
