The objective of this thesis is to study the automorphism groups of the Lie algebras attached to linear systems. A linear system is a pair of vector spaces (U,W) with a nondegenerate pairing \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle\colon U\otimes W\to \mathbb{C}, to which we attach three Lie algebras \mathfrak{sl}_{U,W}\subset \mathfrak{gl}_{U,W}\subset\mathfrak{gl}^M_{U,W}. If both U and W are countable dimensional, then, up to isomorphism, there is a unique linear system (V,V_*). In this case \mathfrak{sl}_{V,V_*} and \mathfrak{gl}_{V,V_*} are the well-known Lie algebras \mathfrak{sl}_\infty and \mathfrak{gl}_\infty, while the Lie algebra \mathfrak{gl}^M_{V,V_*} is the Mackey Lie algebra introduced in \cite{PSer}.   We review results about the monoidal categories \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{sl}_{U,W}} and \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{gl}^M_{U,W}} of tensor modules, both of which turn out to be equivalent as monoidal categories to the category \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{sl}_\infty} introduced earlier in \cite{DPS}. Using the relations between the categories \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{sl}_\infty} and \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{gl}^M_\infty}, we compute the automorphism group of \mathfrak{gl}^M_\infty.
