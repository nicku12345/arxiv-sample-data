Let F be a local non archimedian field of characteristic 0, and G a non-connected reductive group over F. We denote G^0 the connected component of the identity and assume the quotient G/G^0 is abelian. For f a locally constant compactly supported function on G and \pi a complex smooth representation of G, we define the Fourier transform of f evaluated at \pi to be \pi(f) = \int_{G} f(g) \pi(g) \, dg, which is an endomorphism of the underlying vector space of \pi.   We give a description of the image of this Fourier transform map : given, for every \pi in a certain family of induced representations of G, an endomorphism \varphi(\pi) of the underlying vector space, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which there exists a function f (necessarily unique) such that \pi(f) = \varphi(\pi) for all \pi in the family.
