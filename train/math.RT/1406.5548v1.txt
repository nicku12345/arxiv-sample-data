Representation theory of p-adic groups naturally comes in the study of automorphic forms and one way to understand representations of a group is by restricting to its nice subgroups. D. Prasad studied the restriction for pairs ({\rm GL}_{2}(E), {\rm GL}_{2}(F)) and ({\rm GL}_{2}(E), D_{F}^{\times}) where E/F is a quadratic equation and D_{F} is the unique quaternion division algebra, and D_{F}^{\times} \hookrightarrow {\rm GL}_{2}(E). Prasad proved a multiplicity one result and a `dichotomy' relating the restriction for the pairs ({\rm GL}_{2}(E), {\rm GL}_{2}(F)) and ({\rm GL}_{2}(E), D_{F}^{\times}) involving the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence.   We study a restriction problem involving covering groups. In an analogy to the case of Prasad, we consider pairs (\widetilde{{\rm GL}_{2}(E)}, {\rm GL}_{2}(F)) and (\widetilde{{\rm GL}_{2}(E)}, D_{F}^{\times}) where \widetilde{{\rm GL}_{2}(E)} is the \mathbb{C}^{\times}-metaplectic covering of {\rm GL}_{2}(E). We do not have multiplicity one in this case but there is an analogue of dichotomy.
