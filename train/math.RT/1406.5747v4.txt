We compute the minimal model for Ginzburg algebras associated to acyclic quivers Q. In particular, we prove that there is a natural grading on the Ginzburg algebra making it formal and quasi-isomorphic to the preprojective algebra in non-Dynkin type, and in Dynkin type is quasi-isomorphic to a twisted polynomial algebra over the preprojective with a unique higher A_\infty-composition. To prove these results, we construct and study the minimal model of an A_\infty-envelope of the derived category \mathcal{D}^b(Q) whose higher compositions encode the triangulated structure of \mathcal{D}^b(Q).
