We classify finite-dimensional tame modules over the ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebras. For these modules we show that their characters are given by the Kac-Wakimoto character formula, thus establishing the Kac-Wakimoto conjecture for the ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebras. We further relate the Kac-Wakimoto formula to the super Jacobi polynomials of Sergeev and Veselov, and show that these polynomials, up to a sign, give the super characters for these tame modules.
