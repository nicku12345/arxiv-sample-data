In this paper we present a lower bound for the minimal dimension \mu(\mathfrak{n}) of a faithful representation of a finite dimensional p-step nilpotent Lie algebra \mathfrak{n} over a field of characteristic zero. Our bound is given as the minimum of a quadratically constrained linear optimization problem, it works for arbitrary p and takes into account a given filtration of \mathfrak{n}. We present some estimates of this minimum which leads to a very explicit lower bound for \mu(\mathfrak{n}) that involves the dimensions of \mathfrak{n} and its center. This bound allows us to obtain \mu(\mathfrak{n}) for some families of nilpotent Lie algebras.
