In a previous work we established a super Schur-Weyl-Brauer duality between the orthosymplectic supergroup of superdimension (m|2n) and the Brauer algebra with parameter m-2n. This led to a proof of the first fundamental theorem of invariant theory, using some elementary algebraic supergeometry, and based upon an idea of Atiyah. In this work we use the same circle of ideas to prove the second fundamental theorem for the orthosymplectic supergroup. The proof uses algebraic supergeometry to reduce the problem to the case of the general linear supergroup, which is understood. The main result has a succinct formulation in terms of Brauer diagrams. Our proof includes new proofs of the corresponding second fundamental theorems for the classical orthogonal and symplectic groups, as well as their quantum analogues. These new proofs are independent of the Capelli identities, which are replaced by algebraic geometric arguments.
