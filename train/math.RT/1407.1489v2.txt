Paley-Wiener type theorems describe the image of a given space of functions, often compactly supported functions, under an integral transform, usually a Fourier transform on a group or homogeneous space. Several authors have studied Paley-Wiener type theorems for Euclidean spaces, Riemannian symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type as well as affine Riemannian symmetric spaces. In this article we prove a Paley-Wiener theorem for homogeneous line bundles over a compact symmetric space U/K. The Paley-Wiener theorem characterizes f with sufficiently small support in terms of holomorphic extendability and exponential growth of their Fourier transforms. An important tool is a generalization of Opdam's estimate for the hypergeometric functions for multiplicity functions that are not necessarily positive. The domain where this estimate is valid is also bigger. This is done in an appendix.
