All results concern characteristic 2. Two procedures that to every simple Lie algebra assign simple Lie superalgebras, most of the latter new, are offered. We prove that every simple finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra is obtained as the result of one of these procedures, so we classified all simple finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras modulo non-existing at the moment classification of simple finite-dimensional Lie algebras.   This result concerns Lie superalgebras considered naively, as vector spaces. To obtain classification of simple Lie superalgebras in the category of supervarieties, one should list the non-isomorphic deforms (results of deformations) with odd parameter. This problem is open bar several examples described in arXiv~0807.3054.   For Lie algebras, in addition to the known ---"classical" --- restrictedness, we introduce a (2,4)-structure on the two non-alternating series: orthogonal and of Hamiltonian vector fields. For Lie superalgebras, the classical restrictedness of Lie algebras has two analogs: (2|4)- and (2|2)-structures, one more analog --- a (2,4)|4-structure on Lie superalgebras is the analog of (2,4)-structure on Lie algebras.
