Let d>1 be an integer. In 1986, Shen defined a class of weight modules F^\alpha_b(V) over the Witt algebra \mathcal{W}_d for \a\in\C^d, b\in\C, and an irreducible module  V over the special linear Lie algebra \sl_d. In 1996, Eswara Rao determined the necessary and sufficient conditions for these modules to be irreducible when V is finite dimensional. In this note, we will determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for all these modules F^\alpha_b(V) to be irreducible where V is not necessarily finite dimensional. Therefore we obtain a lot of irreducible \mathcal{W}_d-modules with infinite dimensional weight spaces.
