A first characterization of the isomorphism classes of k-involutions for any reductive algebraic group defined over a perfect field was given in \cite{Helm2000} using 3 invariants. In \cite{HWD04,Helm-Wu2002} a full classification of all k-involutions on \text{SL}(n,k) for k algebraically closed, the real numbers, the p-adic numbers or a finite field was provided. In this paper, we find analogous results to develop a detailed characterization of the k-involutions of \text{SO}(n,k,\beta), where \beta is any non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form and k is any field not of characteristic 2. We use these results to classify the isomorphy classes of k-involutions of \text{SO}(n, k,\beta) for some bilinear forms and some fields k.
