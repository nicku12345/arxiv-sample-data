A first characterization of the isomorphism classes of k-involutions for any reductive algebraic groups defined over a perfect field was given by Helminck in 2000 using 3 invariants. In 2004, Helminck, Wu, and Dometrius gave a full classification of all involutions on \text{SL}(n,k) for k algebraically closed, the real numbers, the p-adic numbers or a finite field was provided. In this paper, we build on these results to develop a detailed characterization of the involutions of \text{SP}(2n, k). We use these results to classify the isomorphy classes of involutions of \text{SP}(2n, k) where k is any field not of characteristic 2.
