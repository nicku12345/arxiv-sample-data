Let F be a p-adic field, G = \text{GL}_{2n}(F) and \theta_0 be the exterior automorphism of G that fixes a pinning of a Borel pair. Consider the set \widetilde{G} = G \theta_0 on which G acts by conjugacy and the orbital integral J_{\widetilde{G}}(\theta_0, f) at \theta_0. We prove a Plancherel-Harish-Chandra type formula for this orbital integral, namely as an integral over the irreducible tempered auto-dual representations of G that we call "symplectic" (meaning their Langlands parameter factors through \text{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})). This solves a problem raised by G. Chenevier and L. Clozel. Our method uses the endoscopic transfer to \text{SO}_{2n+1}. Along the way, we also prove that the Plancherel measure is constant on L-packets.
