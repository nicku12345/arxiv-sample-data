We define Kazhdan-Lusztig bases and study asymptotic forms for affine q-Schur algebras following Du and McGerty. We will show that the analogues of Lusztig's conjectures for Hecke algebras with unequal parameters hold for affine q-Schur algebras. We will also show that the affine q-Schur algebra \mathcal{S}_{q,k}^{\vartriangle}(2,2) over a field k has finite global dimension when char k=0 and 1+q\neq 0.
