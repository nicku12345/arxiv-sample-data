We provide geometric constructions of modules over the graded Cherednik algebra \mathfrak{H}^{gr}_\nu and the rational Cherednik algebra \mathfrak{H}^{rat}_\nu attached to a simple algebraic group \mathbb{G} together with a pinned automorphism \theta. These modules are realized on the cohomology of affine Springer fibers (of finite type) that admit \mathbb{C}^*-actions. In the rational Cherednik algebra case, the standard grading on these modules is derived from the perverse filtration on the cohomology of affine Springer fibers coming from its global analog: Hitchin fibers. When \theta is trivial, we show that our construction gives the irreducible finite-dimensional spherical modules \mathfrak{L}_\nu(triv) of \mathfrak{H}^{gr}_\nu and of \mathfrak{H}^{rat}_\nu. We give a formula for the dimension of \mathfrak{L}_\nu(triv) and give a geometric interpretation of its Frobenius algebra structure. The rank two cases are studied in further details.
