Let F be a non-archimedean local field and G={\bf{G}}(F) the group of F-rational points of a connected reductive F-group. Then we have the Langlands classification of complex irreducible admissible representations \pi of G in terms of triples (P,\sigma,\nu) where P\subset G is a standard F-parabolic subgroup, \sigma is an irreducible tempered representation of the standard Levi-group M_P and \nu \in \Bbb{R}\otimes X^*(M_P) is regular with respect to P. Now we consider Langlands' L-parameters [\phi] which conjecturally will serve as a system of parameters for the representations \pi and which are (roughly speaking) equivalence classes of representations \phi of the absolute Galois group \Gamma=\text{Gal}(\overline{F}|F) with image in Langlands' L-group \,^LG, and we classify the possible [\phi] in terms of triples (P,[\,^t\phi],\nu) where the data (P,\nu) are the same as in the Langlands classification of representations and where [\,^t\phi] is a tempered L-parameter of M_P.
