The celebrated Drozd's theorem asserts that a finite-dimensional basic algebra \Lambda over an algebraically closed field k is either tame or wild, whereas the Crawley-Boevey's theorem states that given a tame algebra \Lambda and a dimension d, all but finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable \Lambda-modules of dimension d are isomorphic to their Auslander-Reiten translations and hence belong to homogeneous tubes. In this paper, we prove the inverse of Crawley-Boevey's theorem, which gives an internal description of tameness in terms of Auslander-Reiten quivers.
