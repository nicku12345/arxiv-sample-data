Let {\mathfrak g} be a finite dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0, with solvable radical {\mathfrak r} and nilpotent radical {\mathfrak n}=[{\mathfrak g},{\mathfrak r}]. Given a finite dimensional {\mathfrak g}-module U, its nilpotency series  0\subset U({\mathfrak n}^1)\subset\cdots\subset U({\mathfrak n}^m)=U is defined so that U({\mathfrak n}^1) is the 0-weight space of {\mathfrak n} in U, U({\mathfrak n}^2)/U({\mathfrak n}^1) is the 0-weight space of {\mathfrak n} in U/U({\mathfrak n}^1), and so on. We say that U is linked if each factor of its nilpotency series is a uniserial {\mathfrak g}/{\mathfrak n}-module, i.e., its {\mathfrak g}/{\mathfrak n}-submodules form a chain. Every uniserial {\mathfrak g}-module is linked, every linked {\mathfrak g}-module is indecomposable with irreducible socle, and both converse fail.   In this paper we classify all linked {\mathfrak g}-modules when {\mathfrak g}=\langle x\rangle\ltimes {\mathfrak a} and \mathrm{ad}\, x acts diagonalizably on the abelian Lie algebra {\mathfrak a}. Moreover, we identify and classify all uniserial {\mathfrak g}-module amongst them.
