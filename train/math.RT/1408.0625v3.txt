We study the algebraic framework in which one can define, in the manner of the theta correspondence, a correspondence between representations of two locally profinite groups H_1, H_2. In particular, we examine when and how such a correspondence can be extended to bigger groups G_1, G_2 containing H_1, H_2 respectively as normal subgroups. As an application, we discuss the theta correspondence for a reductive dual pair of the similitude groups in the non-archimedean case.
