Let \mathcal{G} be a split reductive p-adic group with connected centre. We show that each Bernstein block in the principal series of \mathcal{G} admits a definite geometric structure, namely that of an extended quotient. For the Iwahori-spherical block, this extended quotient has the form T//W where T is a maximal torus in the Langlands dual group of \mathcal{G} and W is the Weyl group of \mathcal{G}.
