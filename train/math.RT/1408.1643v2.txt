Let \mathbf{G} be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraic closure \overline{\mathbb{F}_p} of the finite field of prime order p and let F : \mathbf{G} \to \mathbf{G} be a Frobenius endomorphism with G = \mathbf{G}^F the corresponding \mathbb{F}_q-rational structure. One of the strongest links we have between the representation theory of G and the geometry of the unipotent conjugacy classes of \mathbf{G} is a formula, due to Lusztig, which decomposes Kawanaka's Generalised Gelfand-Graev Representations (GGGRs) in terms of characteristic functions of intersection cohomology complexes defined on the closure of a unipotent class. Unfortunately, Lusztig's results are only valid under the assumption that p is large enough. In this article we show that Lusztig's formula for GGGRs holds under the much milder assumption that p is an acceptable prime for \mathbf{G} (p very good is sufficient but not necessary). As an application we show that every irreducible character of G, resp., character sheaf of \mathbf{G}, has a unique wave front set, resp., unipotent support, whenever p is good for \mathbf{G}.
