Nilpotent Lie groups with stepwise square integrable representations were recently investigated by J.A.~Wolf. We give an alternative approach to these representations by relating them to the stratifications of the duals of nilpotent Lie algebras, thus proving that they correspond to a subset with relative Hausdorff topology, dense interior, and total Plancherel measure in the unitary dual of the Lie group under consideration.
