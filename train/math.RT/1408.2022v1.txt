Let n be a natural number larger than two. Let D_{2n}=\langle r,s : r^{n}=s^{2}=e, srs=r^{n-1} \rangle be the Dihedral group, and \kappa  an n-dimensional unitary representation of D_{2n} acting in \mathbb{C}^n as follows. (\kappa (r)v)(j)=v((j-1)\mod n) and (\kappa(s)v)(j)=v((n-j)\mod n) for v\in\mathbb{C}^n. For any representation which is unitarily equivalent to \kappa, we prove that when n is prime there exists a Zariski open subset E of \mathbb{C}^{n} such that for any vector v\in E, any subset of cardinality n of the orbit of v under the action of this representation is a basis for \mathbb{C}^{n}. However, when n is even there is no vector in \mathbb{C}^{n} which satisfies this property. As a result, we derive that if n is prime, for almost every (with respect to Lebesgue measure) vector v in \mathbb{C}^{n} the \Gamma -orbit of v is a frame which is maximally robust to erasures. We also consider the case where \tau is equivalent to an irreducible unitary representation of the Dihedral group acting in a vector space \mathbf{H}_{\tau}\in\left\{\mathbb{C},\mathbb{C}^2\right\} and we provide conditions under which it is possible to find a vector v\in\mathbf{H}_{\tau} such that \tau\left( \Gamma\right) v has the Haar property.
