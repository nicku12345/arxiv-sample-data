Let F be an algebraically closed field and consider the Lie algebra {\mathfrak g}=\langle x\rangle\ltimes {\mathfrak a}, where \mathrm{ad}\, x acts diagonalizably on the abelian Lie algebra {\mathfrak a}. Refer to a {\mathfrak g}-module as admissible if [{\mathfrak g},{\mathfrak g}] acts via nilpotent operators on it, which is automatic if \mathrm{char}(F)=0. In this paper we classify all indecomposable {\mathfrak g}-modules U which are admissible as well as uniserial, in the sense that U has a unique composition series.
