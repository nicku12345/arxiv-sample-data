Let G= SL_3(k) where k is a field of characteristic p > 0 and let \lambda \in X(T) be any weight with corresponding line bundle \mathscr{L}(\lambda) on G/B. In this paper we compute the support varieties for all modules of the form H^i(\lambda):= H^i(G/B, \mathscr{L}(\lambda)) over the first Frobenius kernel G_1. The calculation involves certain recursive character formulas given by Donkin which can be used to compute the characters of the line bundle cohomology groups. In the case where \lambda is a p-regular weight and M=H^i(\lambda)\neq 0 for some i, these formulas are used to show that any p^{th} root of unity \zeta is not a root of the generic dimension of M. To handle the case where \lambda is not p-regular, we employ techniques similar to those used by Drupieski, Nakano and Parshall to show that the module H^i(\lambda) is not projective over G_1 whenever it is nonzero and \lambda lies outside of the Steinberg block.
