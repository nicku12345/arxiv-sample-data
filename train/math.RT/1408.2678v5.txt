It is shown that the silting reduction \ct/\thick\cp of a triangulated category \ct with respect to a presilting subcategory \cp can be realized as a certain subfactor category of \ct, and that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of (pre)silting subcategories of \ct containing \cp and the set of (pre)silting subcategories of \ct/\thick\cp. This is analogous to a result for Calabi-Yau reduction. This result is applied to show that Amiot-Guo-Keller's construction of d-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories with d-cluster-tilting objects takes silting reduction to Calabi-Yau reduction.
