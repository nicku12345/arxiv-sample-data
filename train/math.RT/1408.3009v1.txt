A new descent algebra \sum_{W}(A_{n}) of Weyl groups of type A_n, constructed by present authors in [1], is generated by equivalence classes [x_J] arising from the equivalence relation defined on the set of all x_J. In this paper, we introduce the structure of this new descent algebra for standard parabolic subgroups W_J of Weyl groups of type A_n.
