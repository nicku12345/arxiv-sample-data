Let (\pi,V) be a GL_n(\mathbb{R})-distinguished, irreducible, admissible representation of GL_n(\mathbb{C}), let \pi' be an irreducible, admissible, GL_m(\mathbb{R})-distinguished representation of GL_m(\mathbb{C}), and let \psi be a non-trival character of \mathbb{C} which is trivial on \mathbb{R}. We prove that Rankin-Selberg gamma factor at s=\frac{1}{2} is \gamma(\frac{1}{2},\pi \times \pi'; \psi) = 1. The result follows as a simple consequence from the characterisation of GL_n(\mathbb{R})-distinguished representations in terms of their Langlands data.
