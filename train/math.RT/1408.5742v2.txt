In this paper, we extend the work in "Morita's Theory for the Symplectic Groups" to split reductive groups. We construct and study the holomorphic discrete series representation and the principal series representation of a split reductive group \mathrm {G} over a p-adic field F as well as a duality between certain sub-representations of these two representations.
