An important result of Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov-Ginzburg relates constructible sheaves on the affine Grassmannian to coherent sheaves on the dual Springer resolution. In this paper, we prove a positive-characteristic analogue of this statement, using the framework of "mixed modular sheaves" recently developed by the first author and Riche. As an application, we deduce a relationship between parity sheaves on the affine Grassmannian and Bezrukavnikov's "exotic t-structure" on the Springer resolution.
