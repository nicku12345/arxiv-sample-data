Given partitions \alpha, \beta, \gamma, the short exact sequences 0\to N_\alpha \to N_\beta \to N_\gamma \to 0 of nilpotent linear operators of Jordan types \alpha, \beta, \gamma, respectively, define a constructible subset \mathbb V_{\alpha,\gamma}^\beta of an affine variety. Geometrically, the varieties \mathbb V_{\alpha,\gamma}^\beta are of particular interest as they occur naturally and since they typically consist of several irreducible components. In fact, each Littlewood-Richardson (LR-) tableau \Gamma of shape (\alpha,\beta,\gamma) contributes one irreducible component \overline{\mathbb V}_\Gamma.   We consider the partial order \Gamma\leq_{\sf bound}^*\widetilde{\Gamma} on LR-tableaux which is the transitive closure of the relation given by \mathbb V_{\widetilde{\Gamma}}\cap \overline{\mathbb V}_\Gamma\neq \emptyset. In this paper we compare the boundary relation with partial orders given by algebraic, combinatorial and geometric conditions. It is known that in the case where the parts of \alpha are at most two, all those partial orders are equivalent. We prove that those partial orders are also equivalent in the case where \beta\setminus\gamma is a horizontal and vertical strip. Moreover, we discuss how the orders differ in general.
