By the collective name of {\it lattice counting} we refer to a setup introduced in Duke-Rudnick-Sarnak that aim to establish a relationship between arithmetic and randomness in the context of affine symmetric spaces. In this paper we extend the geometric setup from symmetric to real spherical spaces and continue to develop the approach with harmonic analysis which was initiated in Duke-Rudnick-Sarnak.
