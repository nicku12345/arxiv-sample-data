Let \mathfrak{g} be a finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra with highest root \theta. Given two non-negative integers m, n, we prove that the fusion product of m copies of the level one Demazure module D(1,\theta) with n copies of the adjoint representation {\rm ev}_0 V(\theta) is independent of the parameters and we give explicit defining relations. As a consequence, for \mathfrak{g} simply laced, we show that the fusion product of a special family of Chari-Venkatesh modules is again a Chari-Venkatesh module. We also get a description of the truncated Weyl module associated to a multiple of \theta.
