The classical Gelfand-Tsetlin formulas provide a basis in terms of tableaux and an explicit action of the generators of \mathfrak{gl} (n) for every irreducible finite-dimensional \mathfrak{gl} (n)-module. These formulas can be used to define a \mathfrak{gl} (n)-module structure on some infinite-dimensional modules - the so-called generic Gelfand-Tsetlin modules. The generic Gelfand-Tsetlin modules are convenient to work with since for every generic tableau there exists a unique irreducible generic Gelfand-Tsetlin module containing this tableau as a basis element. In this paper we initiate the systematic study of a large class of non-generic Gelfand-Tsetlin modules - the class of 1-singular Gelfand-Tsetlin modules. An explicit tableaux realization and the action of \mathfrak{gl} (n) on these modules is provided using a new construction which we call derivative tableaux. Our construction of 1-singular modules provides a large family of new irreducible Gelfand-Tsetlin modules of \mathfrak{gl} (n), and is a part of the classification of all such irreducible modules for n=3.
