Consider the generalized iterated wreath product \mathbb{Z}_{r_1}\wr \mathbb{Z}_{r_2}\wr \ldots \wr \mathbb{Z}_{r_k} where r_i \in \mathbb{N}. We prove that the irreducible representations for this class of groups are indexed by a certain type of rooted trees. This provides a Bratteli diagram for the generalized iterated wreath product, a simple recursion formula for the number of irreducible representations, and a strategy to calculate the dimension of each irreducible representation. We calculate explicitly fast Fourier transforms (FFT) for this class of groups, giving literature's fastest FFT upper bound estimate.
