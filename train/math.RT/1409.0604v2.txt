Consider the generalized iterated wreath product S_{r_1}\wr \ldots \wr S_{r_k} of symmetric groups. We give a complete description of the traversal for the generalized iterated wreath product. We also prove an existence of a bijection between the equivalence classes of ordinary irreducible representations of the generalized iterated wreath product and orbits of labels on certain rooted trees. We find a recursion for the number of these labels and the degrees of irreducible representations of the generalized iterated wreath product. Finally, we give rough upper bound estimates for fast Fourier transforms.
