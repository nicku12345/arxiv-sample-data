We construct a naturally \mathbb Z-graded algebra \mathscr G_n(\delta) over R with KLR-like relations and give an explicit isomorphism between \mathscr G_n(\delta) and \mathscr B_n(\delta), the Brauer algebras over R, when R is a field of characteristic 0. This isomorphism allows us to exhibit a non-trivial \mathbb Z-grading on the Brauer algebras over a field of characteristic 0. As a byproduct of the proof, we also construct an explicit homogeneous cellular basis for \mathscr G_n(\delta).
