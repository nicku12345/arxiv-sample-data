In this paper, we introduce a family of indecomposable finite-dimensional graded modules for the twisted current algebras. These modules are indexed by an |R^+|-tuple of partitions \bxi=(\xi^{\alpha})_{\alpha\in R^+} satisfying a natural compatibility condition. We give three equivalent presentations of these modules and show that for a particular choice of \bxi these modules become isomorphic to Demazure modules in various levels for the twisted affine algebras. As a consequence we see that the defining relations of twisted Demazure modules can be greatly simplified. Furthermore, we investigate the notion of fusion products for twisted modules, first defined in \cite{FL99} for untwisted modules, and use the simplified presentation to prove a fusion product decomposition of twisted Demazure modules. As a consequence we prove that twisted Demazure modules can be obtained by taking the associated graded modules of (untwisted) Demazure modules for simply-laced affine algebras. Furthermore we give a semi-infinite fusion product construction for the irreducible representations of twisted affine algebras. Finally, we prove that the twisted Q-sytem defined in \cite{HKOTT02} extends to a non-canonical short exact sequence of fusion products of twisted Demazure modules.
