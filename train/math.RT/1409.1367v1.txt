In this paper, we recover certain known results about the ladder representations of GL(n, Q_p) defined and studied by Lapid, Minguez, and Tadic. We work in the equivalent setting of graded Hecke algebra modules. Using the Arakawa-Suzuki functor from category O to graded Hecke algebra modules, we show that the determinantal formula proved by Lapid-Minguez and Tadic is a direct consequence of the BGG resolution of finite dimensional simple gl(n)-modules. We make a connection between the semisimplicity of Hecke algebra modules, unitarity with respect to a certain hermitian form, and ladder representations.
