Issai Schur, in his doctoral thesis (1901) introduced the Schur algebra to study the polynomial representation theory of the general linear group. He described a basis of this algebra and structure constants. Later, Miguel Mendez (2001) gave a graph-theoretic description of Schur's basis and computed the structure constants. In this presentation, we will give a new graphic interpretation of the basis of Schur algebra and use it to give a description of the structure constants which is equivalent to the one given by Mendez.
