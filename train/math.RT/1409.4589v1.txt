In this paper, we construct an example of a family of 4d-dimensional two-step nilpotent Lie algebras (\frak g_d)_{d\geq 2} so that the cortex of the dual of each \frak g_d is a projective algebraic set. More precisely, we show that the cortex of each dual \frak g_d^* of \frak g_d is the zero set of a homogeneous polynomial of degree d. This example is a generalization of one given in "Irreducible representations of locally compact groups that cannot be Hausdorff separated from the identity representation" by "{\sc M.E.B. Bekka, and E. Kaniuth}".
