This Ph.D. thesis belongs to the realm of mod p representation theory of p-adic groups. The main object of study is the inner form of the general linear group \mathrm{GL}(m,D) where D is a division algebra over a non-Archimedean local field. The first part focuses on the rank 1 case (m=2): it develops in detail the irreducibility criterion for parabolically induced representations and a classification of irreducible admissible smooth representations "\`a la Barthel-Livn\'e". Then one turns to the generalized Steinberg representations: building on ideas of Grosse-Kl\"onne and Herzig, this chapter manages to get a result that is valid for any reductive group over a non-Archimedean local field. Finally the last part exploits the two previous ones, and by overcoming some combinatorial difficulties that arise in the rank >1 case, one gets a classification "\`a la Herzig" for \mathrm{GL}(3,D) and \mathrm{GL}(m,D), m>3, with some technical assumptions on D.
