We construct minimal Eisenstein integrals for a reductive symmetric space G/H as matrix coefficients of the minimal principal series of G. The Eisenstein integrals thus obtained include those from the \sigma-minimal principal series. In addition, we obtain related Eisenstein integrals, but with different normalizations. Specialized to the case of the group, this wider class includes Harish-Chandra's minimal Eisenstein integrals.
