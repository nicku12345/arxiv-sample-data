We study Harish-Chandra bimodules over the rational Cherednik algebra H_{c}(W) associated to a complex reflection group W with parameter c. Our results allow us to partially reduce the study of these bimodules to smaller algebras. We classify those pairs of parameters (c,c') for which there exist fully supported Harish-Chandra bimodules, and give a description of the category of all Harish-Chandra bimodules modulo those without full support. When W is a symmetric group we are able to classify all irreducible Harish-Chandra bimodules. Our proofs are based on localization techniques, the action of the Namikawa-Weyl group on the set of parameters, and the study of partial KZ functors.
