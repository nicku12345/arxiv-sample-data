We prove that the categories of Gelfand-Zeitlin modules of \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{gl}_n and Whittaker modules associated with a semi-simple complex finite-dimensional algebra \mathfrak{g} are extension full in the category of all \mathfrak{g}-modules. This is used to estimate and in some cases determine the global dimension of blocks of the categories of Gelfand-Zeitlin and Whittaker modules.
