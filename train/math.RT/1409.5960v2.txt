Let K be an algebraically closed field. Let (Q,Sp,I) be a skewed-gentle triple, (Q^{sg},I^{sg}) and (Q^g,I^{g}) be its corresponding skewed-gentle pair and associated gentle pair respectively. It proves that the skewed-gentle algebra KQ^{sg}/< I^{sg}> is singularity equivalent to KQ/< I>. Moreover, we use (Q,Sp,I) to describe the singularity category of KQ^g/< I^g>. As a corollary, we get that \mathrm{gldim} KQ^{sg}/< I^{sg}><\infty if and only if \mathrm{gldim} KQ/< I><\infty if and only if \mathrm{gldim} KQ^{g}/< I^{g}><\infty.
