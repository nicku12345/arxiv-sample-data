The article covers developments in the representation theory of finite group schemes over the last fifteen years. We start with the finite generation of cohomology of a finite group scheme and proceed to discuss various consequences and theories that ultimately grew out of that result. This includes the theory of one-parameter subgroups and rank varieties for infinitesimal group schemes; the \pi-points and \Pi-support spaces for finite group schemes, modules of constant rank and constant Jordan type, and construction of bundles on projective varieties associated with cohomology ring of an infinitesimal group scheme G. In the last section we discuss varieties of elementary subalgebras of modular Lie algebras, generalizations of modules of constant Jordan type, and new constructions of bundles on projective varieties associated to a modular Lie algebra.
