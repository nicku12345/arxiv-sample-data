By using a free monoid of operators on the set of compositions (resp. pairs of compositions), we establish in this paper a bijective correspondence between Frobenius standard parabolic (resp. seaweed) subalgebras and certain elements of this monoid. We prove via this correspondence a conjecture of one of the authors on the number of Frobenius standard parabolic (resp. seaweed) subalgebras of \mathrm{sl}_{n}(\Bbbk ) associated to compositions (resp. pairs of compositions) with n-t parts (resp. parts in total).
