Let G be the group of points of a split reductive group over a finite extension of {\mathbb Q}_p. In this paper, we compute the dimensions of certain classes of locally analytic G-representations. This includes principal series representations and certain representations coming from homogeneous line bundles on p-adic symmetric spaces. As an application, we compute the dimensions in Colmez' unitary principal series of {\rm GL}_2({\mathbb Q}_p).
