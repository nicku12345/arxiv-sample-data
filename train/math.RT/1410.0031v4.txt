Let ({\go g}\_{0},B\_{0}) be a quadratic Lie algebra (i.e. a Lie algebra \go{g}\_{0} with a non degenerate symmetric invariant bilinear form B\_{0}) and let (\rho,V) be a finite dimensional representation of {\go g}\_{0}. We define on  \Gamma(\go{g}\_{0}, B\_{0}, V)=V^*\oplus {\go g}\_{0}\oplus V a structure of local Lie algebra in the sense of Kac (\cite{Kac1}), where the bracket between \go{g}\_{0} and V (resp. V^*) is given by the representation \rho (resp. \rho^*), and where the bracket between V and V^* depends on B\_{0} and \rho. This implies the existence of two \Z-graded Lie algebras {\go g}\_{max}(\Gamma(\go{g}\_{0}, B\_{0}, V)) and {\go g}\_{min}(\Gamma(\go{g}\_{0}, B\_{0}, V)) whose local part is \Gamma(\go{g}\_{0},B\_{0}, V). We investigate these graded Lie algebras, more specifically in the case where {\go g}\_{0} is reductive. Roughly speaking, the map (\go{g}\_{0},B\_{0}, V)\longmapsto {\go g}\_{min}(\Gamma(\go{g}\_{0}, B\_{0}, V)) a bijection between triplets and a class of graded Lie algebras. We show that the existence of "associated \go {sl}\_{2}-triples" is equivalent to the existence of non trivial relative invariants on some orbit, and we define the "graded Lie algebras of symplectic type" which give rise to some dual pairs.
