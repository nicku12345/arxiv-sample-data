We define the notion of basic set data for finite groups (building on the notion of basic set, but including an order on the irreducible characters as part of the structure), and we prove that the Springer correspondence provides basic set data for Weyl groups. Then we use this to determine explicitly the modular Springer correspondence for classical types (defined over a base field of odd characteristic p, and with coefficients in a field of odd characteristic \ell\neq p): the modular case is obtained as a restriction of the ordinary case to a basic set. In order to do so, we compare the order on bipartitions introduced by Dipper and James with the order induced by the Springer correspondence. We also provide a quicker proof, by sorting characters according to the dimension of the corresponding Springer fiber, an invariant which is directly computable from symbols.
