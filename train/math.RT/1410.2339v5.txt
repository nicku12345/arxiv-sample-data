A Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}_\mathbb{Q} over \mathbb{Q} is said to be \mathbb{R}-universal if every homomorphism from \mathfrak{g}_\mathbb{Q} to \mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R}) is conjugate to a homomorphism into \mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{Q}) (for every n). By using Galois cohomology, we provide a short proof of the known fact that every real semisimple Lie algebra has an \mathbb{R}-universal \mathbb{Q}-form. We also provide a classification of the \mathbb{R}-universal Lie algebras that are semisimple.
