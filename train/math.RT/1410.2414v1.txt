By using the relative derived categories, we prove that if an Artin algebra A has a module T with {\rm inj.dim}T<\infty such that ^\perp T is finite, then the bounded derived category D^b(A\mbox{-}{\rm mod}) admits a categorical resolution in the sense of [Kuz], and a categorical desingularization in the sense of [BO]. For CM-finite Gorenstein algebra, such a categorical resolution is weakly crepant. The similar results hold also for D^b(A\mbox{-}{\rm Mod}).
