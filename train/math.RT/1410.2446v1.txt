Let U_\varepsilon^{\mathrm{res}}(L\mathfrak{sl}_2) be the restricted integral form of the quantum loop algebra U_q(L\mathfrak{sl}_2) specialised at a root of unity \varepsilon. We prove that the Grothendieck ring of a tensor subcategory of representations of U_\varepsilon^{\mathrm{res}}(L\mathfrak{sl}_2) is a generalised cluster algebra of type C_{l-1}, where l is the order of \varepsilon^2. Moreover, we show that the classes of simple objects in the Grothendieck ring essentially coincide with the cluster monomials. We also state a conjecture for U_\varepsilon^{\mathrm{res}}(L\mathfrak{sl}_3), and we prove it for l=2.
