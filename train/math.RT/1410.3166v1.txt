Let \Lambda be a local truncated path algebra over an algebraically closed field K, i.e., \Lambda is a quotient of a path algebra KQ by the paths of length L+1, where Q is the quiver with a single vertex and a finite number of loops and L is a positive integer. For any d>0, we determine the irreducible components of the varieties that parametrize the d-dimensional representations of \Lambda, namely, the components of the classical affine variety {\rm\bf{Rep}}_{d}(\Lambda) and -- equivalently -- those of the projective parametrizing variety {\rm GRASS}_d(\Lambda). Our method is to corner the components by way of a twin pair of upper semicontinuous maps from {\rm\bf{Rep}}_{d}(\Lambda) to a poset consisting of sequences of semisimple modules.   An excerpt of the main result is as follows. Given a sequence {\bf S} = ({\bf S}_0, ..., {\bf S}_L) of semisimple modules with \dim \bigoplus_{0 \le l \le L} {\bf S}_l = d, let {\rm\bf{Rep}}\, {\bf S} be the subvariety of {\rm\bf{Rep}}_{d}(\Lambda) consisting of the points that parametrize the modules with radical layering {\bf S}. (The radical layering of a \Lambda-module M is the sequence \bigl(J^l M / J^{l+1} M\bigr)_{0 \le l \le L}, where J is the Jacobson radical of \Lambda.) Suppose the quiver Q has r \ge 2 loops. If d \le L+1, the variety {\rm\bf{Rep}}_{d}(\Lambda) is irreducible. If, on the other hand, d > L+1, then the irreducible components of {\rm\bf{Rep}}_{d}(\Lambda) are the closures of the subvarieties {\rm\bf{Rep}}\, {\bf S} for those sequences {\bf S} which satisfy the inequalities \dim {\bf S}_l \le r \dim {\bf S}_{l+1} and \dim {\bf S}_{l+1} \le r \dim {\bf S}_l for 0 \le l < L. As a byproduct, the main result provides generic information on the modules corresponding to the irreducible components of the parametrizing varieties.
