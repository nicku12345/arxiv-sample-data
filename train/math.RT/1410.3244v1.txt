We present a partial classification of the pseudo H-type algebras with minimal admissible Clifford modules. Furthermore, we prove that the subspace \mathfrak{v}_{r,s} of \mathfrak{n}_{r,s} is strongly bracket generating if and only if r=0 or s=0. Additionally, we discuss the classification of pseudo H-type algebras related to non-equivalent irreducible Clifford modules.
