Let \mathtt{k} be an algebraic closure of a finite field \mathbb{F}_{q} of characteristic p. Let G be a connected unipotent group over \mathtt{k} equipped with an \mathbb{F}_q-structure given by a Frobenius map F:G\to G. We will denote the corresponding algebraic group defined over \mathbb{F}_q by G_0. Character sheaves on G are certain objects in the triangulated braided monoidal category \mathscr{D}_G(G) of bounded conjugation equivariant \bar{\mathbb{Q}}_l-complexes (where l\neq p is a prime number) on G. Boyarchenko has proved that the "trace of Frobenius" functions associated with F-stable character sheaves on G form an orthonormal basis of the space of class functions on G_0(\mathbb{F}_q) and that the matrix relating this basis to the basis formed by the irreducible characters of G_0(\mathbb{F}_q) is block diagonal with "small" blocks. In this paper we describe these block matrices and interpret them as certain "crossed S-matrices". We also derive a formula for the dimensions of the irreducible representations of G_0(\mathbb{F}_q) that correspond to one such block in terms of certain modular categorical data associated with that block. In fact we will formulate and prove more general results which hold for possibly disconnected groups G such that G^\circ is unipotent. To prove our results, we will establish a formula (which holds for any algebraic group G) which expresses the inner product of the "trace of Frobenius" function of any F-stable object of \mathscr{D}_G(G) with any character of G_0(\mathbb{F}_q) (or of any of its pure inner forms) in terms of certain categorical operations.
