We formalize the way in which one can think about cluster algebras of infinite rank by showing that every rooted cluster algebra of infinite rank can be written as a colimit of rooted cluster algebras of finite rank. Relying on the proof of the posivity conjecture for skew-symmetric cluster algebras (of finite rank) by Lee and Schiffler, it follows as a direct consequence that the positivity conjecture holds for cluster algebras of infinite rank. Furthermore, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for a ring homomorphism between cluster algebras to give rise to a rooted cluster morphism without specializations. Assem, Dupont and Schiffler proposed the problem of a classification of ideal rooted cluster morphisms. We provide a partial solution by showing that every rooted cluster morphism without specializations is ideal, but in general rooted cluster morphisms are not ideal.
