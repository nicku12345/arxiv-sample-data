We define the generalized Burnside algebra HB(W_{n}) for B_{n}-type Coxeter group W_{n} and construct an surjective algebra morphism between Mantaci-Reutenauer algebra {\sum}'(W_{n}) and HB(W_{n}). Then, by obtaining the primitive idempotents (e_{\lambda})_{\lambda \in \mathcal{DP}(n)} of HB(W_{n}), we consider the image \textrm{res}_{W_{A}}^{W_{n}}e_{B} and \textrm{ind}_{W_{A}}^{W_{n}}e_{B}^{A} under restriction and induction map between generalized Burnside algebras. We give an alternative formula to compute the elements number of conjugate classes of W_{n}. We also obtain an effective method to determine the size of \mathcal{C}(S_{n}) which is the set of elements of type S_{n}.
