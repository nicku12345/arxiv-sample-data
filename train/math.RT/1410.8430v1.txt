We give a criterion for the annihilator in U(\frak{sl}(\infty)) of a simple highest weight \frak{sl}(\infty)-module to be nonzero. As a consequence we show that, in contrast with the case of \frak{sl}(n), the annihilator in U(\frak{sl}(\infty)) of any simple highest weight \frak{sl}(\infty)-module is integrable, i.e., coincides with the annihilator of an integrable \frak{sl}(\infty)-module. Furthermore, we define the class of ideal Borel subalgebras of \frak{sl}(\infty), and prove that any prime integrable ideal in U(\frak{sl}(\infty)) is the annihilator of a simple \frak b^0-highest weight module, where \frak b^0 is any fixed ideal Borel subalgebra of \frak{sl}(\infty). This latter result is an analogue of the celebrated Duflo Theorem for primitive ideals.
