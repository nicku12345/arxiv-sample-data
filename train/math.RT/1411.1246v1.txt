Let G be the simple algebraic group \mathrm{SL}_2 defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0. Using results of A. Parker, we develop a method which gives, for any q \in \mathbb{N}, a closed form description of all simple modules M such that \mathrm{H}^q(G,M) \neq 0, together with the associated dimensions \mathrm{dim}\mathrm{H}^q(G,M). We apply this method for arbitrary primes p and for q \leq 3, confirming results of Cline and Stewart along the way. Furthermore, we show that under the hypothesis p > q, the dimension of the cohomology \mathrm{H}^q(G,M) is at most 1, for any simple module M. Based on this evidence we discuss a conjecture for general semisimple algebraic groups.
