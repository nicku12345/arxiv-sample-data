We show a connection between Lusztig induction operators in finite general linear and unitary groups and parabolic induction in cyclotomic rational double affine Hecke algebras. Two applications are given: an explanation of a bijection result of Brou\'e, Malle and Michel, and some results on modular decomposition numbers of finite general groups.
