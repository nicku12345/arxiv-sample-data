Let E/F be a quadratic extension of p-adic fields. We prove that every smooth irreducible ladder representation of the group GL_n(E) which is contragredient to its own Galois conjugate, possesses the expected distinction properties relative to the subgroup GL_n(F). This affirms a conjecture attributed to Jacquet for a large class of representations. Along the way, we prove a reformulation of the conjecture which concerns standard modules in place of irreducible representations.
