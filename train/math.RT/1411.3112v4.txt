We prove analogues of fundamental results of Kostant on the universal centralizer of a connected reductive algebraic group for algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic (with mild assumptions), and for integral coefficients. As an application, we use these results to obtain a "mixed modular" analogue of the derived Satake equivalence of Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg.
