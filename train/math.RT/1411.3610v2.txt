A normalized holomorphic family (depending on \boldsymbol \lambda \in \mathbb C^3) of conformally invariant trilinear forms on the sphere is studied. Its zero set Z is described. For \boldsymbol \lambda\notin Z, the multiplicity of the space of conformally invariant trilinear forms is shown to be 1, except perhaps for a denumerable subset.
