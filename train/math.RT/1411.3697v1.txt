We study representations of GL(n) appearing as quotients of a tensor of exceptional representations, in the sense of Kazhdan and Patterson. Such representations are called distinguished. We characterize distinguished principal series representations in terms of their inducing data. In particular, we complete the proof of a conjecture of Savin, relating distinguished spherical representations to the image of the tautological lift from a suitable classical group.
