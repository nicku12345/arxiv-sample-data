The cosine-\lambda transform, denoted \mathcal{C}^\lambda, is a family of integral transforms we can define on the sphere and on the Grassmann manifolds \textrm{Gr}(p, \mathbb{K}^n) = \textrm{SU}(n,\mathbb{K})/\text{S}(\textrm{U}(p,\mathbb{K}) \times \textrm{U}(n-p,\mathbb{K})) where \mathbb{K} is \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C} or the skew field \mathbb{H} of quaternions. The family \mathcal{C}^\lambda extends meromorphically in \lambda to the complex plane with poles at (among other values) \lambda =-1,\ldots, -p. In this paper we normalize \mathcal{C}^\lambda and evaluate at those poles. The result is a series of integral transforms on the Grassmannians that we can view as partial cosine-Funk transforms. The transform that arises at \lambda = -p is the natural analog of the Funk transform in this setting.
