We compute the equivariant cohomology ring of the moduli space of framed instantons over the affine plane. It is a Rees algebra associated with the center of cyclotomic degenerate affine Hecke algebras of type A. We also give some related results on the center of quiver Hecke algebras and cohomology of quiver varieties.
