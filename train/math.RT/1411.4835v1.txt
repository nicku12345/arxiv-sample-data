We introduce and study the so-called serpentine representations of the infinite symmetric group \sinf, which turn out to be closely related to the basic representation of the affine Lie algebra \widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2} and representations of the Virasoro algebra.   This is a new version of the manuscript of the same authors "On a relation between the basic representation of the affine Lie algebra \widehat\sl and a Schur--Weyl representation of the infinite symmetric group" (arXiv:1403.1558)
