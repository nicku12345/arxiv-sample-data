In a paper by Holm and Jorgensen, the cluster category \mathscr{D} of type A_\infty, with Auslander-Reiten quiver \mathbb{Z} A_\infty, is introduced. Slices in the Auslander-Reiten quiver of \mathscr{D} give rise to direct systems; the homotopy colimit of such direct systems can be computed and these "Pr\"ufer objects" can be adjoined to form a larger category. It is this larger category, \overline{\mathscr{D}}, which is the main object of study in this paper. We show that \overline{\mathscr{D}} inherits a nice geometrical structure from \mathscr{D}; "arcs" between non-neighbouring integers on the number line correspond to indecomposable objects, and in the case of \overline{\mathscr{D}} we also have arcs to infinity which correspond to the Pr\"ufer objects. During the course of this paper, we show that \overline{\mathscr{D}} is triangulated, compute homs, investigate the geometric model, and we conclude by computing the cluster tilting subcategories of \overline{\mathscr{D}}.
