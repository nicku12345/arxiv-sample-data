Let \Pi_0 be a representation of a group H. We say that a representation \tau is (H,\Pi_0)-distinguished, if it is a quotient of \Pi_0. It is natural to ask whether this notion "inflates" to larger groups, in the sense that a representation \mathrm{I}(\tau) induced from \tau and H to a group G, is (G,\Pi)-distinguished. We study representations distinguished by theta representations: H=GL_n, \Pi_0 is a pair of the exceptional representations of Kazhdan and Patterson, G=GSpin_{2n+1} and \Pi is a pair of the small representations of Bump, Friedberg and Ginzburg. We prove a Rodier-type hereditary property: a tempered representation \tau is distinguished if and only if \mathrm{I}(\tau) is distinguished, and the multiplicity in each model is the same. If \tau is supercuspidal and distinguished, we prove that the Langlands quotient of \mathrm{I}(\tau) is distinguished. As a corollary, we characterize supercuspidal distinguished representations, in terms of the pole of the local symmetric square L-function at s=0.
