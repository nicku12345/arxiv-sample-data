We study the parabolically induced complex representations of the unitary group in 5 variables,  U(5),  defined over a p-adic field.   Let  F  be a p-adic field. Let  E : F  be a field extension of degree two. Let  Gal(E : F ) = \{ 1 , \sigma \}.  We write  \sigma(x) = \overline{x} \; \forall x \in E.  Let  E^* := E \setminus \{ 0 \}  and let  E^1 := \{x \in E \mid x \overline{x} = 1 \}.     U(5)  has three proper standard Levi subgroups, the minimal Levi subgroup  M_0 \cong E^* \times E^* \times E^1  and the two maximal Levi subgroups  M_1 \cong GL(2, E) \times E^1  and  M_2 \cong E^* \times U(3).    We consider representations induced from  M_0  and from non-cuspidal, not fully-induced representations of  M_1  and  M_2.  We determine the points and lines of reducibility and the irreducible subquotients of these representations.
