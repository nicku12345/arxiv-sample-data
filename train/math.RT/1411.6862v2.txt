Let q be a power of a prime, l a prime not dividing q, d a positive integer coprime to both l and the multiplicative order of q\mod l and n a positive integer. A. Watanabe proved that there is a perfect isometry between the principal l-blocks of GL_n(q) and GL_n(q^d) where the correspondence of characters is give by Shintani descent. In the same paper Watanabe also prove that if l and q are odd and l does not divide GL_n(q^2)|/|U_n(q)| then there is a perfect isometry between the principal l-blocks of U_n(q) and GL_n(q^2) with the correspondence of characters also given by Shintani descent. R. Kessar extended this first result to all unipotent blocks of GL_n(q) and GL_n(q^d). In this paper we extend this second result to all unipotent blocks of U_n(q) and GL_n(q^2). In particular this proves that any two unipotent blocks of U_n(q) at unitary primes (for possibly different n) with the same weight are perfectly isometric. We also prove that this perfect isometry commutes with Deligne-Lusztig induction at the level of characters.
