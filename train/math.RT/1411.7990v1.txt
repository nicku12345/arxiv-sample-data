This paper and its sequel describe the irreducible representations of the rational Cherednik algebra H_c(W) for a finite Coxeter group W of type H_4, F_4 with equal parameters, E_6, E_7, and E_8, when c is not a half-integer. Herein appear the decomposition matrices of Category \mathcal{O}_c(W) for W=H_4, E_6, and E_7, as well as a classification of finite-dimensional representations of H_c(W) for these groups and for H_c(F_4) with equal parameters.
