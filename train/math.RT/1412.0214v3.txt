Higher homological algebra was introduced by Iyama. It is also known as n-homological algebra where n \geq 2 is a fixed integer, and it deals with n-cluster tilting subcategories of abelian categories.   All short exact sequences in such a subcategory are split, but it has nice exact sequences with n+2 objects. This was recently formalised by Jasso in the theory of n-abelian categories. There is also a derived version of n-homological algebra, formalised by Geiss, Keller, and Oppermann in the theory of ( n+2 )-angulated categories (the reason for the shift from n to n+2 is that angulated categories have triangulated categories as the "base case").   We introduce torsion classes and t-structures into the theory of n-abelian and ( n+2 )-angulated categories, and prove several results to motivate the definitions. Most of the results concern the n-abelian and ( n+2 )-angulated categories {\mathcal M}( \Lambda ) and {\mathcal C}( \Lambda ) associated to an n-representation finite algebra \Lambda, as defined by Iyama and Oppermann. We characterise torsion classes in these categories in terms of closure under higher extensions, and give a bijection between torsion classes in {\mathcal M}( \Lambda ) and intermediate t-structures in {\mathcal C}( \Lambda ) which is a category one can reasonably view as the n-derived category of {\mathcal M}( \Lambda ). We hint at the link to n-homological tilting theory.
