We introduce the notion of Gabriel filter for a preadditive category C and we show that there is a bijective correspondence between Gabriel filters of C and hereditary torsion theories in the category of additive functors (C,Ab), obtaining a generelization of the theorem given by Gabriel [Ga] and Maranda [Ma] which establishes a bijective correspondence between Gabriel filters for a ring and hereditary torsion theories in the corresponding category of modules.
