Let G=GL_{n}(\mathbb{C}) and 1\ne\psi:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}^{\times} be an additive character. Let U be the subgroup of upper triangular unipotent matrices in G. Denote by \theta the character \theta:U\to\mathbb{C} given by \[ \theta(u):=\psi(u_{1,2}+u_{2,3}+...+u_{n-1,n}). \] Let P be the mirabolic subgroup of G consisting of all matrices in G with the last row equal to (0,0,...,0,1). We prove that if \pi is an irreducible generic representation of GL_{n}(\mathbb{C}) and \mathcal{W}(\pi,\psi) is its Whittaker model, then the space \{f|_{P}:P\to \mathbb{C}:\, f\in \mathcal{W}(\pi,\psi)\} contains the space of infinitely differentiable functions f:P\to \mathbb{C} which satisfy f(up)=\psi(u)f(p) for all u\in U and p\in P and which have a compact support modulo U. A similar result was proven for GL_{n}(F), where F is a p-adic field by Gelfand and Kazhdan in "Representations of the group GL(n,K) where K is a local field", Lie groups and their representations, Proc. Summer School, Bolyai J\'anos Math. Soc., Budapest:95-118, 1975, and for GL_{n}(\mathbb{R}) by Jacquet in "Distinction by the quasi-split unitary group", Israel Journal of Mathematics, 178(1):269-324, 2010.
