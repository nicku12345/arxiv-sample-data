We apply the technique of recollement to study the Gorenstein defect categories of triangular matrix algebras. First, we construct a left recollement of Gorenstein defect categories for a triangular matrix algebra under some conditions, using it, we give a categorical interpretation of the Gorenstein properties of the triangular matrix algebra obtained by X-W. Chen, B. L. Xiong and P. Zhang respectively. Second, under some additional conditions, a recollement of Gorenstein defect categories for a triangular matrix algebra is constructed. As an application, for a special kind of triangular matrix algebras, which are called simple gluing algebras, we describe their singularity categories and Gorenstein defect categories.
