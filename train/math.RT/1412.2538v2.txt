Let \Sigma_r be the symmetric group acting on r letters, K be a field of characteristic 2 and \lambda and \mu be partitions of r in at most two parts. Denote the permutation module corresponding to the Young subgroup \Sigma_\lambda in \Sigma_r by M^\lambda, and the indecomposable Young module by Y^\mu. We give an explicit presentation of the endomorphism algebra {\rm End}_{K[\Sigma_r]}(Y^\mu), using the idempotents found by Doty, Erdmann and Henke in [1].
