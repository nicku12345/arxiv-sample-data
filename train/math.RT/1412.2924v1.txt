We study the parabolically induced complex representations of the unitary group in 5 variables,  U(5),  defined over a p-adic field. Let F be a p-adic field. Let E : F be a field extension of degree two. Let Gal(E : F ) = \{ 1, \sigma \}. We write  \sigma(x) = \overline{x} \; \forall x \in E.  Let  E^* := E \setminus \{ 0 \}  and let  E^1 := \{x \in E \mid x \overline{x} = 1 \}. U(5)  has three proper standard Levi subgroups, the minimal Levi subgroup  M_0 \cong E^* \times E^* \times E^1  and the two maximal Levi subgroups  M_1 \cong GL(2, E) \times E^1  and  M_2 \cong E^* \times U(3). We consider representations induced from the minimal Levi subgroup  M_0,  representations induced from non-cuspidal, not fully-induced representations of the two maximal Levi subgroups  M_1  and  M_2,  and representations induced from cuspidal representations of  M_1. We describe - except several particular cases - the unitary dual in terms of Langlands-quotients.
