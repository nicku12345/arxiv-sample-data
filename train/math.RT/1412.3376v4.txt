Let U=U_n(q) be the group of lower unitriangular n \times n-matrices with entries in the field \mathbb F_q with q elements for some prime power q and n \in \mathbb N. We investigate the restriction to U of the permutation action of GL_n(q) on flags in the natural GL_n(q)-module \mathbb F_q^n. Applying our results to the special case of flags of length two we obtain a complete decomposition of the permutation representation of GL_n(q) on the cosets of maximal parabolic subgroups into irreducible \mathbb C U-modules.
