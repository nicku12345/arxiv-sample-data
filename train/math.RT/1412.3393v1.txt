We study systems of linear and semilinear mappings considering them as representations of a directed graph G with full and dashed arrows: a representation of G is given by assigning to each vertex a complex vector space, to each full arrow a linear mapping, and to each dashed arrow a semilinear mapping of the corresponding vector spaces. We extend to such representations the classical theorems by Gabriel about quivers of finite type and by Nazarova, Donovan, and Freislich about quivers of tame types.
