There are two versions of endoscopic transfer factors to accommodate the different versions, classical or renormalized, of the local Langlands correspondence. An examination of the structure of these complex-valued factors shows that the versions are related in a simple manner. We gather various consequences and indicate ways in which these are useful for the harmonic analysis associated with endoscopic transfer.
