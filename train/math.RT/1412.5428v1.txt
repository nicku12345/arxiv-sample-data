Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system and \Gamma be a group of automorphisms of W such that \gamma(S)=S for all \gamma \in \Gamma. Then it is known that the group of fixed points W^\Gamma is again a Coxeter group with a canonically defined set of generators. The usual proofs of this fact rely on the reflection representation of W. Here, we give a proof which only uses the combinatorics of reduced expressions in W. As a by-product, this shows that the length function on W restricts to a weight function on W^\Gamma.
