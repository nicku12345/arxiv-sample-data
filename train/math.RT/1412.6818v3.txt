In this paper we study Bezrukavnikov's exotic t-structure on the derived category of equivariant coherent sheaves on the Springer resolution of a connected reductive algebraic group defined over a field of positive characteristic with simply-connected derived subgroup. In particular, we show that the heart of the exotic t-structure is a graded highest weight category, and we study the tilting objects in this heart. Our main tool is the "geometric braid group action" studied by Bezrukavnikov and the second author.
