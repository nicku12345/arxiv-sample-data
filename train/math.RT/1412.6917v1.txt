We introduce and study the notion of pseudo-Frobenius graded algebra with enough idempotents, showing that it follows the pattern of the classical concept of pseudo-Frobenius (PF) and Quasi-Frobenius (QF) rings, in particular finite dimensional self-injective algebras, as studied by Nakayama, Morita, Faith, Tachikawa, etc. We show that such an algebra is characterized by the existence of a graded Nakayama form. Moreover, we prove that the pseudo-Frobenius property is preserved and reflected by covering functors, a fact that makes the concept useful in Representation Theory.
