For a block B of a finite group we prove that k(B)\le(\det C-1)/l(B)+l(B)\le\det C where k(B) (respectively l(B)) is the number of irreducible ordinary (respectively Brauer) characters of B, and C is the Cartan matrix of B. As an application, we show that Brauer's k(B)-Conjecture holds for every block with abelian defect group D and inertial quotient T provided there exists an element u\in D such that C_T(u) acts freely on D/<u>. This gives a new proof of Brauer's Conjecture for abelian defect groups of rank at most 2. We also prove the conjecture in case l(B)\le 3.
