Let \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{p} be the Cartan decomposition of the complexified Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}(3,\mathbb{C}) of the group G=SU(2,1). Let K=S(U(2) \times U(1)); so K is a maximal compact subgroup of G. Let U(\mathfrak{g}) be the universal enveloping algebra of \mathfrak{g}, and let C(\mathfrak{p}) be the Clifford algebra with respect to the trace form B(X,Y)=\text{tr}(XY) on \mathfrak{p}. We are going to prove that the algebra of K-invariants in U(\mathfrak{g}) \otimes C(\mathfrak{p}) is generated by five explicitly given elements. This is useful for studying algebraic Dirac induction for (\mathfrak{g},K)-modules. Along the way we will also recover the (well known) structure of the algebra U(\mathfrak{g})^K.
