In the present paper we review our project of systematic construction of invariant differential operators on the example of the non-compact algebras su(n,n) for n=2,3,4. We give explicitly the main multiplets of indecomposable elementary representations and some reduced multiplets. We give explicitly the minimal representations. Due to the recently established parabolic relations the multiplet classification results are valid also for the algebras sl(2n,R) and when n=2k for the algebras su*(4k) with suitably chosen maximal parabolic subalgebras.
