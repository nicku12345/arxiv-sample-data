The Lie algebra of vector fields on R^m acts naturally on the spaces of differential operators between tensor field modules. Its projective subalgebra is isomorphic to sl_{m+1}, and its affine subalgebra is a maximal parabolic subalgebra of the projective subalgebra with Levi factor gl_m. We prove two results. First, we realize all injective objects of the parabolic category O^{gl_m}(sl_{m+1}) of gl_m-finite sl_{m+1}-modules as submodules of differential operator modules. Second, we study projective quantizations of differential operator modules, i.e., sl_{m+1}-invariant splittings of their order filtrations. In the case of modules of differential operators from a tensor density module to an arbitrary tensor field module, we determine when there exists a unique projective quantization, when there exists no projective quantization, and when there exist multiple projective quantizations.
