We describe an approach to express the geometric side of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula in terms of zeta integrals attached to prehomogeneous vector spaces. This will provide explicit formulas for weighted orbital integrals and for the coefficients by which they are multiplied in the trace formula. We implement this programme for the principal unipotent conjugacy class. The method relies on certain convergence results and uses the notions of induced conjugacy classes and canonical parabolic subgroups. So far, it works for certain types of conjugacy classes, which covers all classes appearing in classical groups of absolute rank up to two.
