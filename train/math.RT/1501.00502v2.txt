We adapt techniques used in the study of the cubic Dirac operator on homogeneous reductive spaces to the Dolbeault operator on elliptic coadjoint orbits to prove that cohomologically induced representations have an infinitesimal character, that cohomological induction and Zuckerman translation functor commute and give a geometric interpretation of the Zuchkerman translation functor in this context.
