We study representations of segment type of groups Sp(n) and SO(2n+1, F) over a local non-archimedean field, which play a fundamental role in the constructions of discrete series, and obtain a complete description of the Jacquet modules of these representations. Also, we provide an alternative way for determination of Jacquet modules of strongly positive discrete series and a description of top Jacquet modules of general discrete series. In this version are corrected few typographical errors which exist in the published version of this paper (see page 5 of the paper for more details).
