In this paper, for a vertex operator algebra V with an automorphism g of order T, an admissible V-module M and a fixed nonnegative rational number n\in\frac{1}{T}\Bbb{Z}_{+}, we construct an A_{g,n}(V)-bimodule \AA_{g,n}(M) and study its some properties, discuss the connections between bimodule \AA_{g,n}(M) and intertwining operators. Especially, bimodule \AA_{g,n-\frac{1}{T}}(M) is a natural quotient of \AA_{g,n}(M) and there is a linear isomorphism between the space {\cal I}_{M\,M^j}^{M^k} of intertwining operators and the space of homomorphisms \rm{Hom}_{A_{g,n}(V)}(\AA_{g,n}(M)\otimes_{A_{g,n}(V)}M^j(s), M^k(t)) for s,t\leq n, M^j, M^k are g-twisted V modules, if V is g-rational.
