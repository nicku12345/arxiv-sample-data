We investigate the category of U(h)-free g-modules. Using a functor from this category to the category of coherent families, we show that U(h)-free modules only can exist when g is of type A or C. We then proceed to classify isomorphism classes of U(h)-free modules of rank 1 in type C, which includes an explicit construction of new simple sp(2n)-modules. Finally, we show how translation functors can be used to obtain simple U(h)-free modules of higher rank.
