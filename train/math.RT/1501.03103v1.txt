Let \Gamma be a non-commutative free group on finitely many generators. In a previous work two of the authors have constructed the class of multiplicative representations of \Gamma and proved them irreducible as representation of \Gamma\ltimes_\lambda C(\Omega). In this paper we analyze multiplicative representations as representations of \Gamma and we prove a criterium for irreducibility based on the growth of their matrix coefficients.
