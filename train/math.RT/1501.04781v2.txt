In this paper, we compute the Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions for the infinite-dimensional explicit irreducible \mathfrak{o}(n, \mathbb{C})-modules and \mathfrak{sp}(2n, \mathbb{C})-modules that appeared in the \mathbb{Z}-graded oscillator generalizations of the classical theorem on harmonic polynomials established by Luo and Xu. We also found that some of the modules have the secondly minimal GK-dimension, and some of them have the larger GK-dimension than the maximal GK-dimension of unitary highest-weight modules.
