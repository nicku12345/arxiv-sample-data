Weyl modules were originally defined for affine Lie algebras by Chari and Pressley in \cite{CP}. In this paper we extend the notion of Weyl modules for a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} \otimes A, where \mathfrak{g} is any Kac-Moody algebra and A is any finitely generated commutative associative algebra with unit over \mathbb{C}, and prove a tensor product decomposition theorem generalizing \cite{CP}.
