Let \mathcal{L}^{S}\left(s,\pi,\chi,\operatorname{\mathfrak{st}}\right) be a standard twisted partial \mathcal{L}-function of degree 7 of the cuspidal automorphic representation \pi of the exceptional group of type G_2. In this paper we construct a family of Rankin-Selberg integrals representing this \mathcal{L}-function. As an application, we prove that the representations attaining certain prescribed poles are exactly the representations attained by \theta-lift from a group of finite type.
