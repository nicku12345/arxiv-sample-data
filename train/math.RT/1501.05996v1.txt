Double Kostka polynomials are polynomials indexed by a pair of double partitions. As in the ordinary case, double Kostka polynomials are defined in terms of Schur functions and Hall-Littlewood functions associated to double partitions. In this paper, we study combinatorial properties of those double Kostka polynomials and Hall-Littlewood functions. In particular, we show that the Lascoux-Schutzenberger type formula holds for double Kostka polynomials in certain cases. Moreover, we show that the Hall bimodule introduced by Finkelberg-Ginzburg-Travkin is isomorphic to the ring of symmetric functions with two types of variables, which gives an alternate approach for their result.
