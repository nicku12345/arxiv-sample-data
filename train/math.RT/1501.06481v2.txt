The (Iwahori-)Hecke algebra in the title is a q-deformation \sH of the group algebra of a finite Weyl group W. The algebra \sH has a natural enlargement to an endomorphism algebra \sA=\End_\sH(\sT) where \sT is a q-permutation module. In type A_n (i.e., W\cong {\mathfrak S}_{n+1}), the algebra \sA is a q-Schur algebra which is quasi-hereditary and plays an important role in the modular representation of the finite groups of Lie type. In other types, \sA is not always quasi-hereditary, but the authors conjectured 20 year ago that \sT can be enlarged to an \sH-module \sT^+ so that \sA^+=\End_\sH(\sT^+) is at least standardly stratified, a weaker condition than being quasi-hereditary, but with "strata" corresponding to Kazhdan-Lusztig two-sided cells.   The main result of this paper is a "local" version of this conjecture in the equal parameter case, viewing \sH as defined over {\mathbb Z}[t,t^{-1}], with the localization at a prime ideal generated by a cyclotomic polynomial \Phi_{2e}(t), e\not=2. The proof uses the theory of rational Cherednik algebras (also known as RDAHAs) over similar localizations of {\mathbb C}[t,t^{-1}]. In future paper, the authors expect to apply these results to prove global versions of the conjecture, at least in the equal parameter case with bad primes excluded.
