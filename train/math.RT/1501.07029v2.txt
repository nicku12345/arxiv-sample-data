Let G be a reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, G_1 the Frobenius kernel of G, and T a maximal torus of G. We show that the G_1T-Verma modules of singular highest weights are all rigid, determine their Loewy length, and describe their Loewy structure using the periodic Kazhdan-Lusztig Q-polynomials. We assume that the characteristic of the field is large enough that, in particular, Lusztig's conjecture for the irreducible G_1T-characters hold.
