Let A be a quasi-hereditary algebra. We prove that in many cases, a tilting module is rigid (i.e. has identical radical and socle series) if it does not have certain subquotients whose composition factors extend more than one layer in the radical series or the socle series. We apply this theorem to give new results about the radical series of some tilting modules for SL_4(K), where K is a field of positive characteristic.
