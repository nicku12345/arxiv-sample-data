In this paper we study the local theta correspondences between epipelagic supercupsidal representations of a type I classical dual pair (G,G') over p-adic fields. We show that, besides an exceptional case, an epipelagic supercupsidal representation \pi of \widetilde{G} lifts to an epipelagic supercupsidal representation \pi' of \widetilde{G}' if and only if the epipelagic data of \pi and \pi' are related by the moment maps.
