Let \mathbf{G} be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field \mathbb{F} of good characteristic, satisfying some mild conditions. In this paper we relate tilting objects in the heart of Bezrukavnikov's exotic t-structure on the derived category of equivariant coherent sheaves on the Springer resolution of \mathbf{G}, and Iwahori-constructible \mathbb{F}-parity sheaves on the affine Grassmannian of the Langlands dual group. As applications we deduce in particular the missing piece for the proof of the Mirkovic-Vilonen conjecture in full generality (i.e. for good characteristic), a modular version of an equivalence of categories due to Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov-Ginzburg, and an extension of this equivalence.
