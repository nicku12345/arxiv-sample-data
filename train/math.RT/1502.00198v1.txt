For \mathfrak{g} a simple Lie algebra and G its adjoint group, the Chevalley map and work of Coxeter gives a concrete description of the algebra of G-invariant polynomials on \mathfrak{g} in terms of traces over various representations. Here we provide an extension of this description to G-invariant tensors on \mathfrak{g}, although restricted to only providing generators and only for the classical Lie algebras.
