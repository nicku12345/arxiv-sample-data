If \mathscr{J} is a finite-dimensional nilpotent algebra over a finite field \Bbbk, the algebra group P = 1+\mathscr{J} admits a (standard) supercharacter theory as defined by Diaconis and Isaacs. If \mathscr{J} is endowed with an involution \widehat{\varsigma}, then \widehat{\varsigma} naturally defines a group automorphism of P = 1+\mathscr{J}, and we may consider the fixed point subgroup C_{P}(\widehat{\varsigma}) = \{x\in P : \widehat{\varsigma}(x) = x^{-1}\}. Assuming that \Bbbk has odd characteristic p, we use the standard supercharacter theory for P to construct a supercharacter theory for C_{P}(\widehat{\varsigma}). In particular, we obtain a supercharacter theory for the Sylow p-subgroups of the finite classical groups of Lie type, and thus extend in a uniform way the construction given by Andr\'e and Neto for the special case of the symplectic and orthogonal groups.
