In 1979, Vogan introduced a generalised \\tau -invariant for characterising primitive ideals in enveloping algebras. Via a known dictionary this translates to an invariant of left cells in the sense of Kazhdan and Lusztig. Although it is not a complete invariant, it is extremely useful in describing left cells. Here, we propose a general framework for defining such invariants which also applies to Hecke algebras with unequal parameters.
