In this paper, we study the relation between the cocenter \overline{\tilde \ch_0} and the finite dimensional representations of an affine 0-Hecke algebra \tilde \ch_0. As a consequence, we obtain a new criterion on the supersingular modules: a (virtual) module of \tilde \ch_0 is supersingular if and only if its character vanishes on the non-supersingular part of \overline{\tilde \ch_0}.
