For any gentle algebra \Lambda=KQ/\langle I\rangle, following Kalck, we describe the quiver and the relations for its Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebra \mathrm{Aus}(\mathrm{Gproj}\Lambda) explicitly, and obtain some properties, such as \Lambda is representation-finite if and only if \mathrm{Aus}(\mathrm{Gproj}\Lambda) is; if Q has no loop and any indecomposable \Lambda-module is uniquely determined by its dimension vector, then any indecomposable \mathrm{Aus}(\mathrm{Gproj}\Lambda)-module is uniquely determined by its dimension vector.
