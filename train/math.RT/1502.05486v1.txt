We study the center of U(\mathfrak{n}), where \mathfrak{n} is the locally nilpotent radical of a splitting Borel subalgebra of a simple complex Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{\infty}(\mathbb{C}), \mathfrak{so}_{\infty}(\mathbb{C}), \mathfrak{sp}_{\infty}(\mathbb{C}). There are infinitely many isomorphism classes of Lie algebras \mathfrak{n}, and we provide explicit generators of the center of U(\mathfrak{n}) in all cases. We then fix \mathfrak{n} with "largest possible" center of U(\mathfrak{n}) and characterize the centrally generated primitive ideals of U(\mathfrak{n}) for \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{\infty}(\mathbb{C}), \mathfrak{sp}_{\infty}(\mathbb{C}) in terms of the above generators. As a preliminary result, we provide a characterization of the centrally generated primitive ideals in the enveloping algebra of the nilradical of a Borel subalgebra of \mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbb{C}), \mathfrak{sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}).
