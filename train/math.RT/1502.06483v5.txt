We study generalized and degenerate Whittaker models for reductive groups over local fields of characteristic zero (archimedean or non-archimedean). Our main result is the construction of epimorphisms from the generalized Whittaker model corresponding to a nilpotent orbit to any degenerate Whittaker model corresponding to the same orbit, and to certain degenerate Whittaker models corresponding to bigger orbits. We also give choice-free definitions of generalized and degenerate Whittaker models. Finally, we explain how our methods imply analogous results for Whittaker-Fourier coefficients of automorphic representations.   For \mathrm{GL}_n(F) this implies that a smooth admissible representation \pi has a generalized Whittaker model \mathcal{W}_{\mathcal{O}}(\pi) corresponding to a nilpotent coadjoint orbit \mathcal{O} if and only if \mathcal{O} lies in the (closure of) the wave-front set \mathrm{WF}(\pi). Previously this was only known to hold for F non-archimedean and \mathcal{O} maximal in \mathrm{WF}(\pi), see [MW87]. We also express \mathcal{W}_{\mathcal{O}}(\pi) as an iteration of a version of the Bernstein-Zelevinsky derivatives [BZ77,AGS15a]. This enables us to extend to \mathrm{GL_n}(\mathbb{R}) and \mathrm{GL_n}(\mathbb{C}) several further results from [MW87] on the dimension of \mathcal{W}_{\mathcal{O}}(\pi) and on the exactness of the generalized Whittaker functor.
