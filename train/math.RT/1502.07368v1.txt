This article constructs Shalika germs in the context of motivic integration, both for ordinary orbital integrals and kappa-orbital integrals. Based on transfer principles in motivic integration and on Waldspurger's endoscopic transfer of smooth functions in characteristic zero, we deduce the endoscopic transfer of smooth functions in sufficiently large residual characteristic.
