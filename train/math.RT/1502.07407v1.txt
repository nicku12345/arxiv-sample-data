In this paper we explore relationship between representations of a Jordan algebra \J and the Lie algebra \g obtained from \J by the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction. More precisely, we construct two adjoint functors Lie :\JJ\to \ggm and Jor:\ggm\to\JJ, where \JJ is the category of unital \J-bimodules and \ggm is the category of \g-modules admitting a short grading. Using these functors we classify \J such that its semisimple part is of Clifford type and the category \JJ is tame.
