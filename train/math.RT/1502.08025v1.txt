We introduce parabolic degenerations of rational Cherednik algebras of complex reflection groups, and use them to give necessary conditions for finite-dimensionality of an irreducible lowest weight module for the rational Cherednik algebra of a complex reflection group, and for the existence of a non-zero map between two standard modules. The latter condition reproduces and enhances, in the case of the symmetric group, the combinatorics of cores and dominance order, and in general shows that the c-ordering on category O may be replaced by a much coarser ordering. The former gives a new proof of the classification of finite dimensional irreducible modules for the Cherednik algebra of the symmetric group.
