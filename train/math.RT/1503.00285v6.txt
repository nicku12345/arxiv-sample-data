The class of support \tau-tilting modules was introduced to provide a completion of the class of tilting modules from the point of view of mutations. In this article we study \tau-tilting finite algebras, i.e. finite dimensional algebras A with finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable \tau-rigid modules. We show that A is \tau-tilting finite if and only if very torsion class in \mod A is functorially finite. We observe that cones generated by g-vectors of indecomposable direct summands of each support \tau-tilting module form a simplicial complex \Delta(A). We show that if A is \tau-tilting finite, then \Delta(A) is homeomorphic to an (n-1)-dimensional sphere, and moreover the partial order on support \tau-tilting modules can be recovered from the geometry of \Delta(A). Finally we give a bijection between indecomposable \tau-rigid A-modules and bricks of A satisfying a certain finiteness condition, which is automatic for \tau-tilting finite algebras.
