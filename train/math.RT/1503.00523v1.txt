Vogan raised the idea of Dirac cohomology to study representations of semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras. He conjectured that the infinitesimal character of Harish-Chandra modules are determined by their Dirac cohomology. Huang and Pand\v{z}i\'{c} proved this conjecture and initiated the research on Dirac cohomology for Lie superalgebras based on Kostant's results. The aim of the present paper is to study Dirac cohomology of unitary representations for the general linear superalgebra and its relation to nilpotent Lie superalgebra cohomology.
