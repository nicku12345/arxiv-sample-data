We describe a categorification of the cluster algebra structure of multi-homogeneous coordinate rings of partial flag varieties of arbitrary Dynkin type using Cohen-Macaulay modules over orders. This completes the categorification of Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer by adding the missing coefficients. To achieve this, for an order A and an idempotent e \in A, we introduce a subcategory \operatorname{CM}\nolimits_e A of \operatorname{CM}\nolimits A and study its properties. In particular, under some mild assumptions, we construct an equivalence of exact categories (\operatorname{CM}\nolimits_e A)/[Ae] \cong \operatorname{Sub}\nolimits Q for an injective B-module Q where B := A/(e). These results generalize work by Jensen-King-Su concerning the cluster algebra structure of the Grassmannian \operatorname{Gr}\nolimits_m(\mathbb{C}^n).
