Let S be a pomonoid, in this paper, {\bf Pos}-S, the category of S-posets and S-poset maps, is considered. First, we characterize some pomonoids on which all projectives in this category are generator or free. Then, we study regular injectivity and weakly regularly d-injectivity which lead to some homological classification results for pomonoids. Among other things, we get some relationships between regular injectivity in the slice category {\bf Pos}-S/B_S and generators or cyclic projectives in {\bf Pos}-S.
