The category of strict polynomial functors inherits an internal tensor product from the category of divided powers. To investigate this monoidal structure, we consider the category of representations of the symmetric group which admits a tensor product coming from its Hopf algebra structure. It is classical that there exists a functor F from the category of strict polynomial functors to the category of representations of the symmetric group. Our main result is that this functor F is monoidal. In addition we study the relations under F between projective strict polynomial functors and permutation modules and the link to symmetric functions.
