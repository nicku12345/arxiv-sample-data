We give a generalization of the classical tilting theorem. We show that for a 2-term silting complex \mathbf{P} in the bounded homotopy category K^b(\mathop{\rm proj}\nolimits A) of finitely generated projective modules of a finite dimensional algebra A, the algebra B = \mathop{\rm End}\nolimits_{K^b(\mathop{\rm proj}\nolimits A)}(\mathbf{P}) admits a 2-term silting complex \mathbf{Q} with the following properties: (i) The endomorphism algebra of \mathbf{Q} in K^b(\mathop{\rm proj}\nolimits B) is a factor algebra of A, and (ii) there are induced torsion pairs in \mathop{\rm mod}\nolimits A and \mathop{\rm mod}\nolimits B, such that we obtain natural equivalences induced by \mathop{\rm Hom}\nolimits- and \mathop{\rm Ext}\nolimits-functors. Moreover, we show how the Auslander-Reiten theory of \mathop{\rm mod}\nolimits B can be described in terms of the Auslander-Reiten theory of \mathop{\rm mod}\nolimits A.
