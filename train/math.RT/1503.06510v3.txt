We provide a sufficient condition for the cyclicity of an ordered tensor product L=V_{a_1}(\omega_{b_1})\otimes V_{a_2}(\omega_{b_2})\otimes...\otimes V_{a_k}(\omega_{b_k}) of fundamental representations of the Yangian Y(\mathfrak{g}). When \mathfrak{g} is a classical simple Lie algebra, we make the cyclicity condition concrete, which leads to an irreducibility criterion for the ordered tensor product L. In the case when \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{l+1}, a sufficient and necessary condition for the irreducibility of the ordered tensor product L is obtained. The cyclicity of the ordered tensor product L is closely related to the structure of the local Weyl modules of Y(\mathfrak{g}). We show that every local Weyl module is isomorphic to an ordered tensor product of fundamental representations of Y(\mathfrak{g}).
