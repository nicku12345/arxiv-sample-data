The finite-dimensional restricted simple Lie algebras of characteristic p > 5 are classical or of Cartan type. The classical algebras are analogues of the simple complex Lie algebras and have a well-advanced representation theory with important connections to Kazhdan-Lusztig theory, quantum groups at roots of unity, and the representation theory of algebraic groups. We survey progress that has been made towards developing a representation theory for the restricted simple Cartan-type Lie algebras, discuss comparable results in the classical case, formulate a couple of conjectures, and pose a dozen open problems for further study.
