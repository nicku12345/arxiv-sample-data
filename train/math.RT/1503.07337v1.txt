Let F be a non-Archimedian local field of characteristic zero and E/F a quadratic extension. The aim of the present article is to study the multiplicity of an irreducible admissible representation of {\rm GL}_2(F) occurring in an irreducible admissible genuine representation of non-trivial two fold covering \widetilde{{\rm GL}}_2(E) of {\rm GL}_2(E).
