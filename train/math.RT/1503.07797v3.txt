Let E be a elementary abelian p-group of order q=p^n. Let W be a faithful indecomposable representation of E with dimension 2 over a field k of characteristic p, and let V= S^m(W) with m<q. We prove that the rings of invariants k[V]^E are generated by elements of degree at most q and relative transfers. This extends recent work of Wehlau on modular invariants of cyclic groups of order p. If m<p we prove that k[V]^E is generated by invariants of degree at most 2q-3, extending a result of Fleischmann, Sezer, Shank and Woodcock for cyclic groups of order p. Our methods are primarily representation-theoretic, and along the way we prove that for any d<q with d+m \geq q, S^d(V^*) is projective relative to the set of subgroups of E with order at most m, and that the sequence S^d(V^*)_{d \in \mathbb{N}} is periodic with period q, modulo summands which are projective relative to the same set of subgroups. These results extend results of Almkvist and Fossum on cyclic groups of prime order.
