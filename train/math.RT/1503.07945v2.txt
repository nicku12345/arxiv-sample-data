We use semi-invariant pictures to prove two conjectures about maximal green sequences. First: if Q is any acyclic valued quiver with an arrow j\to i of infinite type then any maximal green sequence for Q must mutate at i before mutating at j. Second: for any quiver Q' obtained by mutating an acyclic valued quiver Q of tame type, there are only finitely many maximal green sequences for Q'. Both statements follow from the Rotation Lemma for reddening sequences and this in turn follows from the Mutation Formula for the semi-invariant picture for Q.
