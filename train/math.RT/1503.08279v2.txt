We prove that the coordinate rings of SO(2n,C)-character varieties are not generated by trace functions nor generalized trace functions for n\geq 2 and all groups Gamma of corank \geq 2. Furthermore, we give examples of non-conjugate completely reducible representations undistinguishable by generalized trace functions. Hence, SO(2n,C)-character varieties are not varieties of characters. However, we also prove that any generic SO(2n,C)-representation of a free group can be distinguished from all non-equivalent representations by trace functions and by a single generalized trace function.
