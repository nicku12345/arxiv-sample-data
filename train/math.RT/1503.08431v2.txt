Let G be a real, reductive algebraic group, and let X be a homogeneous space for G with a non-zero invariant density. We give an explicit description of a Zariski open, dense subset of the asymptotics of the tempered support of L^2(X). Under additional hypotheses, this result remains true for vector bundle valued harmonic analysis on X. These results follow from an upper bound on the wave front set of an induced Lie group representation under a uniformity condition.
