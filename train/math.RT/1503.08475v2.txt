We show that m-APR tilting preserves n-representation infiniteness for 1\leq m\leq n. Moreover, we show that these tilting modules provide different tilting modules for the corresponding higher preprojective algebras, which is (n+1)-CY algebras. We also study the interplay of the two kinds of tilting modules.
