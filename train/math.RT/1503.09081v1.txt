This paper is the continuation of the work in~\cite{Yin}. In that paper we generalized the definition of W-graph ideal in the weighted Coxeter groups, and showed how to construct a W-graph from a given W-graph ideal in the case of unequal parameters.   In this paper we study the full W-graphs for a given W-graph ideal. We show that there exist a pair of dual modules associated with a given W-graph ideal, they are connected by a duality map. % and the dual W-graph bases can be established. For each of the dual modules, the associated full W-graphs can be constructed.% among them, another pair of dual bases are obtained by using %the inversions of the relative Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. Our construction closely parallels that of Kazhdan and Lusztig~\cite{KL, Lusztig1, Lusztig2}, which can be regarded as the special case J=\emptyset. It also generalizes the work of Couillens~\cite{C}, Deodhar~\cite{Deodhar, Deodhar2}, and Douglass \cite{MD}, corresponding to the parabolic cases.
