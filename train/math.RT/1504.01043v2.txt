In this paper, we show that the homotopy category of N-complexes of projective R-modules is triangle equivalent to the homotopy category of projective T_{N-1}(R)- modules where T_{N-1}(R) is the ring of triangular matrices of order N-1 with entries in R. We also define the notions of N-singularity category and N-totally acyclic complexes. We show that the category of N-totally acyclic complexes of finitely generated projective R-modules embeds in the N-singularity category, which is a result analogous to the case of ordinary chain complexes.
