This paper is a continuation of a previous paper of the author, which gave an analogue to the classical Schur-Weyl duality in the setting of Deligne categories.   Given a finite-dimensional unital vector space V (a vector space V with a chosen non-zero vector \mathbf{1}), we constructed a complex tensor power of V: an Ind-object of the Deligne category \underline{Rep}(S_t) which is a Harish-Chandra module for the pair (\mathfrak{gl}(V), \bar{\mathfrak{P}}_{\mathbf{1}}), where \bar{\mathfrak{P}}_{\mathbf{1}} \subset GL(V) is the mirabolic subgroup preserving the vector \mathbf{1}.   This construction allowed us to obtain an exact contravariant functor \widehat{SW}_{t, V} from the category \underline{Rep}^{ab}(S_t) (the abelian envelope of the category \underline{Rep}(S_t)) to a certain localization of the parabolic category \mathcal{O} associated with the pair (\mathfrak{gl}(V), \bar{\mathfrak{P}}_{\mathbf{1}}). In this paper, we consider the case when V = \mathbb{C}^{\infty}. We define the appropriate version of the parabolic category \mathcal{O} and its localization, and show that the latter is equivalent to a "restricted" inverse limit of categories \widehat{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathfrak{p}}_{t,\mathbb{C}^N} with N tending to infinity. The Schur-Weyl functors \widehat{SW}_{t, \mathbb{C}^N} then give an anti-equivalence between this category and the category \underline{Rep}^{ab}(S_t). This duality provides an unexpected tensor structure on the category \widehat{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathfrak{p}_{\infty}}_{t, \mathbb{C}^{\infty}}.
