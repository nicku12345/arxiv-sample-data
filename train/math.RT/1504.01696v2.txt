In this article, we construct certain commutative subalgebras of the big shuffle algebra of cyclic type. This can be considered as a generalization of the similar construction for the small shuffle algebra, obtained by Feigin-Hashizume-Hoshino-Shiraishi-Yanagida. We present a Bethe algebra realization of these subalgebras. The latter identifies them with the Bethe subalgebras of quantum affine gl(n).
