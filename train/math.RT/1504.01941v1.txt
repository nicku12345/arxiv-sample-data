Here we consider two algebras, a free unital associative complex algebra (denoted by {\mathcal{B}}) equiped with a multiparametric \textbf{\emph{q}}-differential structure and a twisted group algebra (denoted by {\mathcal{A}(S_{n})}), with the motivation to represent the algebra {\mathcal{A}(S_{n})} on the (generic) weight subpaces of the algebra {\mathcal{B}}. One of the fundamental problems in {\mathcal{B}} is to describe the space of all constants (the elements which are annihilated by all multiparametric partial derivatives). To solve this problem, one needs some special matrices and their factorizations in terms of simpler matrices. A simpler approach is to study first certain canonical elements in the twisted group algebra {\mathcal{A}(S_{n})}. Then one can use certain natural representation of {\mathcal{A}(S_{n})} on the weight subspaces of {\mathcal{B}}, which are the subject of this paper.
