Let kE denote the group algebra of an elementary abelian p-group of rank r over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. We investigate the functors \mathcal{F}_i from kE-modules of constant Jordan type to vector bundles on \mathbb{P}^{r-1}(k), constructed by Benson and Pevtsova. For a kE-module M of constant Jordan type, we show that restricting the sheaf \mathcal{F}_i(M) to a dimension s-1 linear subvariety of \mathbb{P}^{r-1}(k) is equivalent to restricting M along a corresponding rank s shifted subgroup of kE and then applying \mathcal{F}_i.   In the case r=2, we examine the generic kernel filtration of M in order to show that \mathcal{F}_i(M) may be computed on certain subquotients of M whose Loewy lengths are bounded in terms of i. More precise information is obtained by applying similar techniques to the nth power generic kernel filtration of M. The latter approach also allows us to generalise our results to higher ranks r.
