Cuspidal representations of a reductive p-adic group G over a field of characteristic different from p are relatively injective and projective with respect to extensions that split by a U-equivariant linear map for any subgroup U that is compact modulo the centre. The category of smooth representations over a field whose characteristic does not divide the pro-order of G is the product of the subcategories of cuspidal representations and of subrepresentations of direct sums of parabolically induced representations.
