If \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g}_{\overline{0}} \oplus \mathfrak{g}_{\overline{1}} is a Lie superalgebra over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0, the notion of an endotrivial module has recently been extended to \mathfrak{g}-modules by defining M to be endotrivial if \operatorname{Hom}_k(M,M) \cong k_{ev} \oplus P as \mathfrak{g}-supermodules. Here, k_{ev} denotes the trivial module concentrated in degree \overline{0} and P is a (U(\mathfrak{g}), U(\mathfrak{g}_{\overline{0}}))-projective supermodule. In the stable module category, these modules form a group under the tensor product. If T(\mathfrak{g}) denotes the group of endotrivial \mathfrak{g}-modules, it is interesting and useful to identify this group for a given Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{g}. In this paper, a classification is given in the case where \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{gl}(m|n) and it is shown that T(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)) \cong k \times \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_2 and is generated by the one parameter family of one dimensional modules k_\lambda where \lambda \in k, \Omega^1(k_{ev}), which denotes the first syzygy of k_{ev}, and the parity change functor.
