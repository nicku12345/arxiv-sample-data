Let G be a finite group of Lie type and \St_k be the Steinberg representation of G, defined over a field k. We are interested in the case where k has prime characteristic~\ell and \St_k is reducible. Tinberg has shown that the socle of \St_k is always simple. We give a new proof of this result in terms of the Hecke algebra of G with respect to a Borel subgroup and show how to identify the simple socle of \St_k among the principal series representations of~G. Furthermore, we determine the composition length of \St_k when G=\GL_n(q) or G is a finite classical group and \ell is a so-called linear prime.
