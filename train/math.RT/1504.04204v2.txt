In the present paper we continue the project of systematic construction of invariant differential operators on the example of the non-compact algebra so^*(12). We give the main multiplets of indecomposable elementary representations. Due to the recently established parabolic relations the multiplet classification results are valid also for the algebra so(6,6) with suitably chosen maximal parabolic subalgebra.
