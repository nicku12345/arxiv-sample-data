We consider the conjugation-action of an arbitrary upper-block parabolic subgroup of {\rm GL}_n(\mathbf{C}) on the variety of x-nilpotent complex matrices and translate it to a representation-theoretic context. We obtain a criterion as to whether the action admits a finite number of orbits and specify a system of representatives for the orbits in the finite case of 2-nilpotent matrices. Furthermore, we give a set-theoretic description of their closures and specify the minimal degenerations in detail for the action of the Borel subgroup. We show that in all non-finite cases, the corresponding quiver algebra is of wild representation type.
