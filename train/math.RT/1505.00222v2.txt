We study the relative Lie algebra cohomology of \mathfrak{so}(p,q) with values in the Weil representation \varpi of the dual pair \mathrm{Sp}(2k, \mathbb{R}) \times \mathrm{O}(p,q). Using the Fock model we filter this complex and construct the associated spectral sequence. We then prove that the resulting spectral sequence converges to the relative Lie algebra cohomology and has E_0 term, the associated graded complex, isomorphic to a Koszul complex. It is immediate that the construction of the spectral sequence of Chapter 3 can be applied to any reductive subalgebra \mathfrak{g} \subset \mathfrak{sp}(2k(p+q), \mathbb{R}).   In case the symplectic group is large relative to the orthogonal group (k \geq pq), the E_0 term is isomorphic to a Koszul complex defined by a regular sequence, see 3.4. Thus, the cohomology vanishes except in top degree. This result is obtained without calculating the space of cochains and hence without using any representation theory. On the other hand, in case k < p, we know the Koszul complex is not that of a regular sequence from the existence of the class \varphi_{kq} of Kudla and Millson, see [KM2], a nonzero element of the relative Lie algebra cohomology of degree kq.   For the case of \mathrm{SO}_0(p,1) we compute the cohomology groups in these remaining cases, namely k < p. We do this by first computing a basis for the relative Lie algebra cochains and then splitting the complex into a sum of two complexes, each of whose E_0 term is then isomorphic to a Koszul complex defined by a regular sequence.
