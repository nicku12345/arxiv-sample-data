In this work we discuss some appearances of semi-infinite combinatorics in representation theory. We propose a semi-infinite moment graph theory and we motivate it by considering the (not yet rigorously defined) geometric side of the story. We show that it is possible to compute stalks of the local intersection cohomology of the semi-infinite flag variety, and hence of spaces of quasi maps, by performing an algorithm due to Braden and MacPherson.
