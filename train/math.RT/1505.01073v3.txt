We prove the existence and main properties of signed Young modules for the symmetric group, using only basic facts about symmetric group representations and the Brou{\'e} correspondence. We then prove new reduction theorems for the signed p-Kostka numbers, defined to be the multiplicities of signed Young modules as direct summands of signed Young permutation modules. We end by classifying the indecomposable signed Young permutation modules and determining their endomorphism algebras.
