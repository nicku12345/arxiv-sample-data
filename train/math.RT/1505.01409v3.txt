We characterize dual spaces and compute hyperdimensions of irreducible representations for two classes of compact hypergroups namely conjugacy classes of compact groups and compact hypergroups constructed by joining compact and finite hypergroups. Also studying the representation theory of finite hypergroups, we highlight some interesting differences and similarities between the representation theories of finite hypergroups and finite groups. Finally, we compute the Heisenberg inequality for compact hypergroups.
