We consider the Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} of a simple, simply connected algebraic group over a field of large positive characteristic. For each nilpotent orbit \mathcal{O} \subseteq \mathfrak{g} we choose a representative e\in \mathcal{O} and attach a certain filtered, associative algebra \widehat{U}(\mathfrak{g},e) known as a finite W-algebra, defined to be the opposite endomorphism ring of the generalised Gelfand-Graev module associated to (\mathfrak{g}, e). This is shown to be Morita equivalent to a certain central reduction of the enveloping algebra of U(\mathfrak{g}). The result may be seen as a modular version of Skryabin's equivalence.
