Let F be a non-archimedean local field. We prove that every Bernstein component in the smooth dual of each inner form of the general linear group GL_n(F) is canonically in bijection with the extended quotient for the action, given by Bernstein, of a finite group on a complex torus. For inner forms of SL_n(F) we prove that each Bernstein component is canonically in bijection with the associated twisted extended quotient. In both cases, the bijections satisfy naturality properties with respect to the tempered dual, parabolic induction, central character, and the local Langlands correspondence.
