Let \Mod \CS denote the category of \CS-modules, where \CS is a small category. In the first part of this paper, we provide a version of Rickard's theorem on derived equivalence of rings for \Mod \CS. This will have several interesting applications. In the second part, we apply our techniques to get some interesting recollements of derived categories in different levels. We specialize our results to path rings as well as graded rings.
