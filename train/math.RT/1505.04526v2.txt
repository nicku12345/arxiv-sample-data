Let R be a ring and \mathcal{Q} be a finite and acyclic quiver. We present an explicit formula for the injective envelopes and projective precovers in the category \rm{Rep} (\mathcal{Q} ,R) of representations of \mathcal{Q} by left R-modules. We also extend our formula to all terms of the minimal injective resolution of R\mathcal{Q}. Using such descriptions, we study the Auslander-Gorenstein property of path algebras. In particular, we prove that the path algebra R\mathcal{Q} is k-Gorenstein if and only if \mathcal{Q}=\overrightarrow{A_{n}} and R is a k-Gorenstein ring, where n is the number of vertices of \mathcal{Q}.
