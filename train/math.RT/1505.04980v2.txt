We investigate how the higher almost split sequences over a tensor product of algebras are related to those over each factor. Herschend and Iyama gave a precise criterion for when the tensor product of an n-representation finite algebra and an m-representation finite algebra is (n+m)-representation finite. In this case we give a complete description of the higher almost split sequences over the tensor product by expressing every higher almost split sequence as the mapping cone of a suitable chain map and using a natural notion of tensor product for chain maps.
