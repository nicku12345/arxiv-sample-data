We obtain Koszul-type dualities for categories of graded modules over a graded associative algebra which can be realized as the semidirect product of a bialgebra coinciding with its degree zero part and a graded module algebra for the latter. In particular, this applies to graded representations of the universal enveloping algebra of the Takiff Lie algebra (or the truncated current algebra) and its (super)analogues, and also to semidirect products of quantum groups with braided symmetric and exterior module algebras in case the latter are flat deformations of classical ones.
