Let A be an artinian algebra, and let \mathcal{C} be a subcategory of modA that is closed under extensions. When \mathcal{C} is closed under kernels of epimorphisms (or closed under cokernels of monomorphisms), we describe the smallest class of modules that filters \mathcal{C}. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for the finitistic dimension of an algebra over a field to be finite. We also apply our results to the torsion pairs. In particular, when a torsion pair is induced by a tilting module, we show that the smallest classes of modules that filter the torsion and torsion-free classes are completely compatible with the quasi-equivalences of Brenner and Butler.
