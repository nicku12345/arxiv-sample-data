Let A be a commutative, associative algebra with unity over \mathbb{C}. Using the definition of global Weyl modules for the map superalgebras given by Calixto, Lemay, and Savage we explicitly describe the structure of certain quotients of the global Weyl modules for the map superalgebra \mathfrak{sl}(2,1)\otimes A. We also give a nice basis for these modules. This work is an extension of a Theorem of Feigin and Loktev describing the structure of the Weyl module for the map algebra \mathfrak{sl}_2\otimes A. This work can naturally be extended to similar quotients of the global Weyl modules for \mathfrak{sl}(n,m)\otimes A.
