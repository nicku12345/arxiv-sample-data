In this paper we study the poset of basic tilting kQ-modules when Q is a Dynkin quiver, and the poset of basic support \tau-tilting kQ-modules when Q is a connected acyclic quiver respectively. It is shown that the first poset is a distributive lattice if and only if Q is of types \mathbb{A}_{1}, \mathbb{A}_{2} or \mathbb{A}_{3} with a nonlinear orientation and the second poset is a distributive lattice if and only if Q is of type \mathbb{A}_{1}.
