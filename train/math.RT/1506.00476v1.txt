We show that Lusztig's homomorphism from an affine Hecke algebra to the direct summand of its asymptotic Hecke algebra corresponding to the lowest two-sided cell is related to the homomorphism constructed by Chriss and Ginzburg using equivariant K-theory by a matrix over the representation ring of the associated algebraic group.
