For every finite dimensional Lie supergroup (G,\mathfrak g), we define a C^*-algebra \mathcal A:=\mathcal A(G,\mathfrak g), and show that there exists a canonical bijective correspondence between unitary representations of (G,\mathfrak g) and nondegenerate *-representations of \mathcal A. The proof of existence of such a correspondence relies on a subtle characterization of smoothing operators of unitary representations.   For a broad class of Lie supergroups, which includes nilpotent as well as classical simple ones, we prove that the associated C^*-algebra is CCR. In particular, we obtain the uniqueness of direct integral decomposition for unitary representations of these Lie supergroups.
