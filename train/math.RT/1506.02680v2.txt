We study multiplicity space signatures in tensor products of representations of \mathfrak{sl}_2 and U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2), and give some applications. We completely classify definite multiplicity spaces for generic tensor products of \mathfrak{sl}_2 Verma modules. This provides a classification of a family of unitary representations of a basic quantized quiver variety, one of the first such classifications for any quantized quiver variety. We use multiplicity space signatures to provide the first real critical point lower bound for generic \mathfrak{sl}_2 master functions. As a corollary of this bound, we obtain a simple and asymptotically correct approximation for the number of real critical points of a generic \mathfrak{sl}_2 master function. We obtain a formula for multiplicity space signatures in tensor products of finite dimensional simple U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2) representations. Our formula also gives multiplicity space signatures in generic tensor products of \mathfrak{sl}_2 Verma modules and generic tensor products of real U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2) Verma modules. Our results have relations with knot theory, statistical mechanics, quantum physics, and geometric representation theory.
