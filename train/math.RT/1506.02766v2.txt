In this paper we investigate some methods on calculating the spaces of generalized semi-invariant distributions on p-adic spaces. Using homological methods, we give a criterion of automatic extension of (generalized) semi-invariant distributions. Based on the meromorphic continuations of Igusa zeta integrals, we give another criteria with purely algebraic geometric conditions, on the extension of generalized semi-invariant distributions.
