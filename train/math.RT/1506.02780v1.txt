In this paper, we realize the algebra of \mathbb{Z}_2-relations, signed partition algebras and partition algebras as tabular algebras and prove the cellularity of these algebras using the method of \cite{GM1}.   Using the results of Graham and Lehrer in \cite{GL}, we give the modular representations of the algebra of \mathbb{Z}_2-relations, signed partition algebras and partition algebras.
