The theory of Caldero-Chapoton algebras of Cerulli-Irelli, Labardini-Fragoso and Schroer leads to a refinement of the notions of cluster variables and clusters, via so called component clusters. In this paper we compare component clusters to classical clusters for the cluster algebra of an acyclic quiver. We propose a definition of mutation between component clusters and determine the mutation relations of component clusters for affine quivers. In the case of a wild quiver, we provide bounds for the size of component clusters.
