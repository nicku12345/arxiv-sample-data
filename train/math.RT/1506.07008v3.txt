We classify projective functors on the regular block of Rocha-Caridi's parabolic version of the BGG category \mathcal{O} in type A. In fact, we show that, in type A, the restriction of an indecomposable projective functor from \mathcal{O} to the parabolic category is either indecomposable or zero. As a consequence, we obtain that projective functors on the parabolic category \mathcal{O} in type A are completely determined, up to isomorphism, by the linear transformations they induce on the level of the Grothendieck group, which was conjectured by Stroppel in \cite{St}.
