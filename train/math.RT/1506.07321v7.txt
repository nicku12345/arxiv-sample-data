We first give a direct proof of a basis theorem for the cyclotomic Yokonuma-Hecke algebra Y_{r,n}^{d}(q). Our approach follows Kleshchev's, which does not use the representation theory of Y_{r,n}^{d}(q), and so it is very different from that of [ChP2]. We also present two applications. Then we prove that the cyclotomic Yokonuma-Hecke algebra Y_{r,n}^{d}(q) is cellular by constructing an explicit cellular basis, and show that the Jucys-Murphy elements for Y_{r,n}^{d}(q) are JM-elements in the abstract sense. In the appendix, we shall develop the fusion procedure for Y_{r,n}^{d}(q).
