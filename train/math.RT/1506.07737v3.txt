Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system, let \varphi be a weight function on S and let {\mathrm{Cact}}\_W denote the associated {\it cactus group}. Following an idea of I. Losev, we construct an action of {\mathrm{Cact}}\_W \times {\mathrm{Cact}}\_W on W which has nice properties with respect to the partition of W into left, right or two-sided cells (under some hypothesis, which hold for instance if \varphi is constant or if W is finite of rank \textless{} 5). It must be noticed that the action depends heavily on \varphi.
