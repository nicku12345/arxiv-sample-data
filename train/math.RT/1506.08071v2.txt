We construct a complex linear Weil representation \rho of the generalized special linear group G={\rm SL}_*^{1}(2,A_n) (A_n=K[x]/\langle x^n\rangle, K the quadratic extension of the finite field k of q elements, q odd), where A_n is endowed with a second class involution. After the construction of a specific data, the representation is defined on the generators of a Bruhat presentation of G, via linear operators satisfying the relations of the presentation. The structure of a unitary group U associated to G is described. Using this group we obtain a first decomposition of \rho.
