Given a graded associative algebra A, its lower central series is defined by L_1 = A and L_{i+1} = [L_i, A]. We consider successive quotients N_i(A) = M_i(A) / M_{i+1}(A), where M_i(A) = AL_i(A) A. These quotients are direct sums of graded components. Our purpose is to describe the \mathbb{Z}-module structure of the components; i.e., their free and torsion parts. Following computer exploration using {\it MAGMA}, two main cases are studied. The first considers A = A_n / (f_1,\dots, f_m), with A_n the free algebra on n generators \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\} over a field of characteristic p. The relations f_i are noncommutative polynomials in x_j^{p^{n_j}}, for some integers n_j. For primes p > 2, we prove that p^{\sum n_j} \mid \text{dim}(N_i(A)). Moreover, we determine polynomials dividing the Hilbert series of each N_i(A). The second concerns A = \mathbb{Z} \langle x_1, x_2, \rangle / (x_1^m, x_2^n). For i = 2,3, the bigraded structure of N_i(A_2) is completely described.
