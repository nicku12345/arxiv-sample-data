We calculate Bernstein-Sato b-functions for f_{G^3}^\lambda, a SL_n-invariant section of a line bundle on SL_n/B \times SL_n/B \times \mathbb{P}^{n - 1} whose zero-set is the complement of the open G-diagonal orbit. The proof uses a similar calculation by Kashiwara of the b-function for f^\lambda, a B^--semiinvariant section of a line bundle on SL_n/B whose zero-set is the complement of the big Bruhat cell.
