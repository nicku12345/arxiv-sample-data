Following a scheme suggested by B. Feigon, we investigate a local relative trace formula in the situation of a reductive p -adic group G relative to a symmetric subgroup H= \underline{H}(F) where \underline{H} is split over the local field F of characteristic zero and G = \underline{G} (F) is the restriction of scalars of \underline{H} _{I E} relative to a quadratic unramified extension E of F. We adapt techniques of the proof of the local trace formula by J. Arthur in order to get a geometric expansion of the integral over H \times H of a truncated kernel associated to the regular representation of G.
