Let G be a reductive algebraic group scheme defined over \mathbb{F}_p and let G_1 denote the Frobenius kernel of G. To each finite-dimensional G-module M, one can define the support variety V_{G_1}(M), which can be regarded as a G-stable closed subvariety of the nilpotent cone. A G-module is called a tilting module if it has both good and Weyl filtrations.   In 1997, it was conjectured by J.E. Humphreys that when p\geq h, the support varieties of the indecomposable tilting modules coincide with the nilpotent orbits given by the Lusztig bijection. In this paper, we shall verify this conjecture when G=SL_n and p > n+1.
