In a joint paper P. Pand\v{z}i\'c and D. Renard proved that holomorphic and antiholomorphic discrete series representations can be constructed via algebraic Dirac induction. The group SU(2,1), except for those two types, also has a third type of discrete series representations that are neither holomorphic nor antiholomorphic. In this paper we show that nonholomorphic discrete series representations of the group SU(2,1) can also be constructed using algebraic Dirac induction.
