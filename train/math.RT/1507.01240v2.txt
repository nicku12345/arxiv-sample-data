Let V be an n dimensional vector space over an algebraic closure of a finite field F_q and put G = GL(V). For a positive integer r, we consider the variety X_{uni} = G_{uni} \times V^{r-1}, on which G acts diagonally. X_{uni} is the "unipotent part" of the enhanced variety of level r. X_{uni} is partitioned into finitely many pieces X_{\lambda} labelled by r-partitions \lambda of n, and we consider the intersection cohomology IC_{\lambda} associated to X_{\lambda}. In this paper, we show that the Frobenius trace functions (over F_q) associated to those IC_{\lambda} satisfy certain orthogonality relations, which are very close to the equations characterizing the Kostka functions indexed by (a pair of) r-partitions. Using this we show, in some special cases, that the Kostka functions can be described in terms of those intersection cohomology, which is a (partial) generalization of the known results for the case r = 1, 2.
