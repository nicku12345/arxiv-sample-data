We apply equivariant elliptic cohomology to the Steinberg variety in Springer theory, and prove that the corresponding convolution algebra is isomorphic to the elliptic affine Hecke algebra constructed by Ginzburg-Kapranov-Vasserot. Under this isomorphism, we describe explicitly the cohomology classes that correspond to the elliptic Demazure-Lusztig operators. As an application, we study the Deligne-Langlands theory in the elliptic setting, and classify irreducible representations of the elliptic affine Hecke algebra. The irreducible representations are in one to one correspondence with certain nilpotent Higgs bundles on the elliptic curve. We also study representations at torsion points in type-A.
