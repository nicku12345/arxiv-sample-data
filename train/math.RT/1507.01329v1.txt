Given a complex orthosymplectic superspace V, the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra \mathfrak {osp}(V) and general linear algebra {\mathfrak {gl}}_N both act naturally on the coordinate super-ring \mathcal{S}(N) of the dual space of V\otimes{\mathbb C}^N, and their actions commute. Hence the subalgebra \mathcal{S}(N)^{\mathfrak {osp}(V)} of \mathfrak {osp}(V)-invariants in \mathcal{S}(N) has a {\mathfrak {gl}}_N-module structure. We introduce the space of super Pfaffians as a simple {\mathfrak {gl}}_N-submodule of \mathcal{S}(N)^{\mathfrak {osp}(V)}, give an explicit formula for its highest weight vector, and show that the super Pfaffians and the elementary (or `Brauer') {\rm OSp}-invariants together generate \mathcal{S}(N)^{\mathfrak {osp}(V)} as an algebra. The decomposition of \mathcal{S}(N)^{\mathfrak {osp}(V)} as a direct sum of simple {\mathfrak {gl}}_N-submodules is obtained and shown to be multiplicity free. Using Howe's ({\mathfrak {gl}}(V), {\mathfrak {gl}}_N)-duality on \mathcal{S}(N), we deduce from the decomposition that the subspace of \mathfrak{osp}(V)-invariants in any simple {\mathfrak {gl}}(V)-tensor module is either 0 or 1-dimensional. These results also enable us to determine the \mathfrak {osp}(V)-invariants in the tensor powers V^{\otimes r} for all r.
