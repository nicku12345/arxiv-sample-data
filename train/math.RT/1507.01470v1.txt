Let S be the sphere of dimension n-1, n\geq 4. Let (\pi_{\lambda})_{\lambda\in \mathbb C} be the scalar principle series of representations of the conformal group SO_0(1,n), realized on \mathcal C^\infty(S). For \boldsymbol \lambda = (\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3) \in \mathbb C^3, let Tri(\boldsymbol \lambda) be the space of continuous trilinear forms on \mathcal C^\infty(S) \times \mathcal C^\infty(S) \times \mathcal C^\infty(S) which are invariant under \pi_{\lambda_1} \otimes \pi_{\lambda_2} \otimes \pi_{\lambda_3} . For each value of \boldsymbol \lambda, the dimension of Tri(\boldsymbol \lambda) is computed and a basis of Tri(\boldsymbol \lambda) is described.
