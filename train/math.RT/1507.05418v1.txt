Let \F be a non-Archimedean locally compact field, q be the cardinality of its residue field, and \R be an algebraically closed field of characteristic \ell not dividing q.We classify all irredu\-cible smooth \R-representations of \GL\_n(\F) having a nonzero \GL\_{n-1}(\F)-inva\-riant linear form, when q is not congruent to 1 mod \ell.Partial results in the case when q is 1 mod \ell show that, unlike the complex case, the space of \GL\_{n-1}(\F)-invariant linear forms has dimension 2 for certain irreducible representations.
