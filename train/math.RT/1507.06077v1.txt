Let \mathfrak g be a locally finite split simple complex Lie algebra of type A_J, B_J, C_J or D_J and \mathfrak h \subseteq \mathfrak g be a splitting Cartan subalgebra. Fix D \in \mathrm{der}(\mathfrak g) with \mathfrak h \subseteq \ker D (a diagonal derivation). Then every unitary highest weight representation (\rho_\lambda, V^\lambda) of \mathfrak g extends to a representation \tilde\rho_\lambda of the semidirect product \mathfrak g \rtimes \mathbb C D and we say that \tilde\rho_\lambda is a positive energy representation if the spectrum of -i\tilde\rho_\lambda(D) is bounded from below. In the present note we characterise all pairs (\lambda,D) with \lambda bounded for which this is the case.   If U_1(\mathcal H) is the unitary group of Schatten class 1 on an infinite dimensional real, complex or quaternionic Hilbert space and \lambda is bounded, then we accordingly obtain a characterisation of those highest weight representations \pi_\lambda satisfying the positive energy condition with respect to the continuous \mathbb R-action induced by D. In this context the representation \pi_\lambda is norm continuous and our results imply the remarkable result that, for positive energy representations, adding a suitable inner derivation to D, we can achieve that the minimal eigenvalue of \tilde\rho_\lambda(D) is 0 (minimal energy condition). The corresponding pairs (\lambda,D) satisfying the minimal energy condition are rather easy to describe explicitly.
