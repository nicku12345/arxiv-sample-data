Let B be the split extension of a finite dimensional algebra C by a C-C-bimodule E. We define a morphism of associative graded algebras \varphi^*:\HH^*(B)\rightarrow \HH^*(C) from the Hochschild cohomology of B to that of C, extending similar constructions for the first cohomology groups made and studied by Assem, Bustamante, Igusa, Redondo and Schiffler. In the case of a trivial extension B=C\ltimes E, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for each \varphi^n to be surjective. We prove the surjectivity of \varphi^1 for a class of trivial extensions that includes relation extensions and hence cluster-tilted algebras. Finally, we study the kernel of \varphi^1 for any trivial extension, and give a more precise description of this kernel in the case of relation extensions.
