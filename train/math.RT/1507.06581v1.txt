We study some aspects of modular generalized Springer theory for a complex reductive group G with coefficients in a field \mathbb k under the assumption that the characteristic \ell of \mathbb k is rather good for G, i.e., \ell is good and does not divide the order of the component group of the centre of G. We prove a comparison theorem relating the characteristic-\ell generalized Springer correspondence to the characteristic-0 version. We also consider Mautner's characteristic-\ell `cleanness conjecture'; we prove it in some cases; and we deduce several consequences, including a classification of supercuspidal sheaves and an orthogonal decomposition of the equivariant derived category of the nilpotent cone.
