We construct a family of graded isomorphisms between certain subquotients of diagrammatic Cherednik algebras as the quantum characteristic, multicharge, level, degree, and weighting are allowed to vary; this provides new structural information even in the case of the classical q-Schur algebra. This also allows us to prove some of the first results concerning the (graded) decomposition numbers of these algebras over fields of arbitrary characteristic.
