Generalized root systems (GRS), that were introduced by V. Serganova, are a generalization of finite root systems (RS). We define a generalization of affine root systems (ARS), which we call \textit{affine generalized root systems} (AGRS). The set of real roots of almost every symmetrizable affine indecomposable Kac-Moody superalgebra is an irreducible AGRS. In this paper we classify all AGRSs and show that almost every irreducible AGRS is the set of real roots of a symmetrizable affine indecomposable Kac-Moody superalgebra.
