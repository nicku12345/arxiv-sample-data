The derived category D({\rm Mod}A) of a Gorenstein triangular matrix algebra A admits an unbounded ladder; and this ladder restricts to D^-({\rm Mod}) {\rm(}resp. D^b({\rm Mod}), D^b({\rm mod}), K^b({\rm proj}){\rm)}. A left recollement of triangulated categories with Serre functors sits in a ladder of period 1; as an application, the singularity category of A admits a ladder of period 1.
