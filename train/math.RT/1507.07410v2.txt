Let A be a ring with 1\neq 0, not necessarily finite, endowed with an involution~*, that is, an anti-automorphism of order \leq 2. Let H_n(A) be the additive group of all n\times n hermitian matrices over A relative to *. Let {\mathcal U}_n(A) be the subgroup of \mathrm{GL}_n(A) of all upper triangular matrices with 1's along the main diagonal. Let P=H_n(A)\rtimes {\mathcal U}_n(A), where {\mathcal U}_n(A) acts on H_n(A) by *-congruence transformations. We may view P as a unipotent subgroup of either a symplectic group \mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(A), if *=1_A (in which case A is commutative), or a unitary group \mathrm{U}_{2n}(A) if *\neq 1_A. In this paper we construct and classify a family of irreducible representations of P over a field F that is essentially arbitrary. In particular, when A is finite and F=\mathbb C we obtain irreducible representations of P of the highest possible degree.
