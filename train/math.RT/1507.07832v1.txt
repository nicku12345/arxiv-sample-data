Working over an algebraically closed field k of any characteristic, we determine the matrix factorizations for the --- suitably graded --- triangle singularities f=x^a+y^b+z^c of domestic type, that is, we assume that (a,b,c) are integers at least two, satisfying 1/a+1/b+1/c>1. Using work by Kussin-Lenzing-Meltzer, this is achieved by determining projective covers in the Frobenius category of vector bundles on the weighted projective line of weight type (a,b,c). Equivalently, in a representation-theoretic context, we can work in the mesh category of \mathbb{Z}\tilde\Delta over k, where \tilde\Delta is the extended Dynkin diagram, corresponding to the Dynkin diagram \Delta=[a,b,c]. Our work is related to, but in methods and results different from, the determination of matrix factorizations for the \mathbb{Z}-graded simple singularities by Kajiura-Saito-Takahashi. In particular, we obtain symmetric matrix factorizations whose entries are scalar multiples of monomials, with scalars taken from \{0,\pm1\}.
