Motivated by physical and topological applications, we study representations of the group \mathcal{LB}_3 of motions of 3 unlinked oriented circles in \mathbb{R}^3. Our point of view is to regard the three strand braid group \mathcal{B}_3 as a subgroup of \mathcal{LB}_3 and study the problem of extending \mathcal{B}_3 representations. We introduce the notion of a \emph{standard extension} and characterize \mathcal{B}_3 representations admiting such an extension. In particular we show, using a classification result of Tuba and Wenzl, that every irreducible \mathcal{B}_3 representation of dimension at most 5 has a (standard) extension. We show that this result is sharp by exhibiting an irreducible 6-dimensional \mathcal{B}_3 representation that has no extensions (standard or otherwise). We obtain complete classifications of (1) irreducible 2-dimensional \mathcal{LB}_3 representations (2) extensions of irreducible 3-dimensional \mathcal{B}_3 representations and (3) irreducible \mathcal{LB}_3 representations whose restriction to \mathcal{B}_3 has abelian image.
