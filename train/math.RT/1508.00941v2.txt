Given a finite-dimensional module, V, for a finite-dimensional, complex, semi-simple Lie algebra \lie g and a positive integer m, we construct a family of graded modules for the current algebra \lie g[t] indexed by simple \CC\lie S_m-modules. These modules have the additional structure of being free modules of finite rank for the ring of symmetric polynomials and so can be localized to give finite-dimensional graded \lie g[t]-modules. We determine the graded characters of these modules and show that if \lie g is of type A and V the natural representation, these graded characters admit a curious duality.
