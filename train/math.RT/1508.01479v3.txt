We look at the centralizer in a semisimple algebraic group G of a regular nilpotent element, and show that its closure in the wonderful compactification is isomorphic to the Peterson variety. It follows that the closure in the wonderful compactification of the centralizer G^x of any regular element x is isomorphic to the closure of a general G^x-orbit in the flag variety. We also give a description of the G^e-orbit structure of the Peterson variety.
