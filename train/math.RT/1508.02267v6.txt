Let K be a field and G be a group of its automorphisms. If G is precompact then K is a generator of the category of smooth (i.e. with open stabilizers) K-semilinear representations of G. There are non-semisimple smooth semilinear representations of G over K if G is not precompact.   In this note the smooth semilinear representations of the group G of all permutations of an infinite set S are studied. Let k be a field and k(S) be the field freely generated over k by the set S (endowed with the natural G-action). One of principal results describes the Gabriel spectrum of the category of smooth k(S)-semilinear representations of G.   It is also shown, in particular, that (i) for any smooth G-field K any smooth finitely generated K-semilinear representation of G is noetherian, (ii) for any G-invariant subfield K in the field k(S), the object k(S) is an injective cogenerator of the category of smooth K-semilinear representations of G, (iii) if K\subset k(S) is the subfield of rational homogeneous functions of degree 0 then there is a one-dimensional K-semilinear representation of G, whose integral tensor powers form a system of injective cogenerators of the category of smooth K-semilinear representations of G, (iv) if K\subset k(S) is the subfield generated over k by x-y for all x,y\in S then there is a unique isomorphism class of indecomposable smooth K-semilinear representations of G of each given finite length.
