We classify all triangulated orbit categories of path-algebras of Dynkin diagrams that are triangle equivalent to a stable module category of a representation-finite self-injective standard algebra. For each triangulated orbit category T we give an explicit description of a representation-finite self-injective standard algebra with stable module category triangle equivalent to T.
