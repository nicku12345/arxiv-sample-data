Let \mathcal{A} be a Hom-finite additive Krull-Schmidt k-category where k is an algebraically closed field. Let {\rm mod} \mathcal{A} denote the category of locally finite dimensional \mathcal{A}-modules, that is, the category of covariant functors \mathcal{A} \to {\rm mod} k. We prove that an irreducible monomorphism in {\rm mod} \mathcal{A} has a finitely generated cokernel, and that an irreducible epimorphism in {\rm mod} \mathcal{A} has a finitely co-generated kernel. Using this, we get that an almost split sequence in {\rm mod} \mathcal{A} has to start with a finitely co-presented module and end with a finitely presented one. Finally, we apply our results in the study of {\rm rep}(Q), the category of locally finite dimensional representations of a strongly locally finite quiver. We describe all possible shapes of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of {\rm rep}(Q).
