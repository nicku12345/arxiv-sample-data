Let G be a connected reductive group over \kk, an algebraic closure of a finite field. For an integer r\ge 1 let G_r=G(\kk[\e]/(\e^r)) viewed as an algebraic group of dimension r\dim G over \kk. We show that the character of the generic principal series representation of G_r(F_q) can be realized by a simple perverse sheaf on G_r provided that r=2 or r=4 and we give a strategy to prove the same statement for any even r. (The case where r=1 is already known.)
