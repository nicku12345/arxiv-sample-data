We discuss the Qualitative Uncertainty Principle for Gabor transform on certain classes of the locally compact groups, like abelian groups, \mathbb{R}^n\times K, K \ltimes \mathbb{R}^n where K is compact group. We shall also prove a weaker version of Qualitative Uncertainty Principle for Gabor transform in case of compact groups.
