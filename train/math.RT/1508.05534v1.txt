Let SL_2 be the rank one simple algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>0. The paper presents a new method for computing the dimension of the cohomology spaces \text{H}^n(SL_2,V(m)) for Weyl SL_2-modules V(m). We provide a closed formula for \text{dim}\text{H}^n(SL_2,V(m)) when n\le 2p-3 and show that this dimension is bounded by the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number. This formula is then used to compute \text{dim}\text{H}^n(SL_2, V(m)) for n=1, 2, or 3. For n>2p-3, an exponential bound, only depending on n, is obtained for \text{dim}\text{H}^n(SL_2,V(m)). Analogous results are also established for the extension spaces \text{Ext}^n_{SL_2}(V(m_2),V(m_1)) between Weyl modules V(m_1) and V(m_2). In particular, we determine the degree three extensions for all Weyl modules of SL_2. As a byproduct, our results and techniques give explicit upper bounds for the dimensions of the cohomology of the Specht modules of symmetric groups, the cohomology of simple modules of SL_2, and the finite group of Lie type SL_2(p^s).
