We find conditions such that cup products induce isomorphisms in low degrees for extensions between stable polynomial representations of the general linear group. We apply this result to prove generalizations and variants of the Steinberg tensor product theorem. Our connectedness bounds for cup product maps depend on numerical invariants which seem also relevant to other problems, for example to study the cohomological behavior of the Schur functor.
