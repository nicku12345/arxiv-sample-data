In this paper we classify all the cyclic finite dimensional indecomposable\\ modules of the perfect Lie algebras \mathfrak{sl}(n+1)\ltimes \mathbbm{C}^{n+1}, given by the semidirect sum of the simple Lie algebra A_n with its standard representation. Furthermore, using the embeddings of the Lie algebras \mathfrak{sl}(n+1)\ltimes \mathbbm{C}^{n+1} in \mathfrak{sl}(n+2), we show that any finite dimensional irreducible module of \mathfrak{sl}(n+2) restricted to \mathfrak{sl}(n+1)\ltimes \mathbbm{C}^{n+1} is a cyclic module and that any cyclic \mathfrak{sl}(n+1)\ltimes \mathbbm{C}^{n+1}--modules can be constructed as quotient module of the restriction to \mathfrak{sl}(n+1)\ltimes \mathbbm{C}^{n+1} of some finite dimensional irreducible \mathfrak{sl}(n+2)--modules. This explicit realization of the cyclic \mathfrak{sl}(n+1)\ltimes \mathbbm{C}^{n+1}--modules plays a role in their classification.
