We consider imaginary Verma modules for quantum affine algebraU_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}(2)}) and define a crystal-like base which we call an imaginary crystal basis using the Kashiwara algebra K_q constructed in earlier work of the authors. In particular, we prove the existence of imaginary like bases for a suitable category of reduced imaginary Verma modules for U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}(2)}).
