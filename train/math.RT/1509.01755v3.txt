We prove a generalization of Harish-Chandra's character orthogonality relations for discrete series to arbitrary Harish-Chandra modules for real reductive Lie groups. This result is an analogue of a conjecture by Kazhdan for \mathfrak p-adic reductive groups proved by Bezrukavnikov, and Schneider and Stuhler.
