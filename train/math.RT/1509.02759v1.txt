The paper is to classify irreducible integrable modules for the twisted full toroidal Lie algebra with some technical conditions. The twisted full toroidal Lie algebra are extensions of multiloop algebra twisted by sevaral finite order automorphisms. The result genaralizes a result by Fu Jiayuan and Cuipo Jiang, where they consider only one automorphism.
