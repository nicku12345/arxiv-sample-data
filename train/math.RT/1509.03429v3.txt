Let G/H be a unimodular real spherical space which is either absolutely spherical or wave-front. It is shown that every tempered representation of G/H embeds into a relative discrete series of a boundary degeneration of G/H. If in addition G/H is of wave-front type it follows that the tempered representation is parabolically induced from a discrete series representation of a lower dimensional real spherical space.
