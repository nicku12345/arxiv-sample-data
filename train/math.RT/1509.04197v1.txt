We show that the p-power maps in the first Hochschild cohomology space of finite-dimensional selfinjective algebras over a field of prime characteristic p commute with stable equivalences of Morita type on the subgroup of classes represented by integrable derivations. We show, by giving an example, that the p-power maps do not necessarily commute with arbitrary transfer maps in the Hochschild cohomology of symmetric algebras.
