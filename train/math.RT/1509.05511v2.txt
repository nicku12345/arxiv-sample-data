We define a class of finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras, which are called (simple) polygon-tree algebras, as a generalization of cluster-tilted algebras of type \D. They are 2-CY-tilted algebras. Using a suitable process of mutations of quivers with potentials (which are also BB-mutations) inducing derived equivalences, and one-pointed (co)extensions which preserve singularity equivalences, we find a connected selfinjective Nakayama algebra whose stable category is equivalent to the singularity category of a simple polygon-tree algebra. Furthermore, we also give a classification of algebras of this kind up to representation type.
