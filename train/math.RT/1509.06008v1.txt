Let SP_n(\mathbb{C}) be the symplectic group and \mathfrak{sp}_n(\mathbb{C}) its Lie algebra. Let B be a Borel subgroup of SP_n(\mathbb{C} ), \mathfrak{b}={\rm Lie}(B) and \mathfrak n its nilradical. Let \mathcal X be a subvariety of elements of square 0 in \mathfrak n. B acts adjointly on \mathcal X. In this paper we describe topology of orbits \mathcal X/B in terms of symmetric link patterns.   Further we apply this description to the computations of the closures of orbital varieties of nilpotency order 2 and to their intersections. In particular we show that all the intersections of codimension 1 are irreducible.
