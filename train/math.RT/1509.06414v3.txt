We study asymptotic properties of the modular representation theory of symmetric groups and investigate modular analogs of stabilization phenomena in characteristic zero. The main results are equivalences of categories between certain abelian subcategories of representations of S_n and S_m for different n and m. We apply these results to obtain a structural result for FI-modules, and to prove a result conjectured by Deligne in a recent letter to Ostrik.
