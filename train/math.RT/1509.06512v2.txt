Building on work of the first and last author, we prove that an embedding of simple affine vertex algebras V_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathfrak g^0)\subset V_{k}(\mathfrak g), corresponding to an embedding of a maximal equal rank reductive subalgebra \mathfrak g^0 into a simple Lie algebra \mathfrak g, is conformal if and only if the corresponding central charges are equal. We classify the equal rank conformal embeddings. Furthermore we describe, in almost all cases, when V_{k}(\mathfrak g) decomposes finitely as a V_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathfrak g^0)-module.
