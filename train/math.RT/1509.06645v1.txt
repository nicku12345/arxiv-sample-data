This paper is a survey article on the limiting behavior of the discrete spectrum of the right regular representation in L^2(\Gamma\bs G) for a lattice \Gamma in a reductive group G over a number field. We discuss various aspects of the Weyl law, the limit multiplicity problem, the analytic torsion, and applications to the cohomology of arithmetic groups.
