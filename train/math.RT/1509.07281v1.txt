This paper studies nilpotent orbits in complex simple Lie algebras from the viewpoint of strongly visible actions in the sense of T. Kobayashi. We prove that the action of a maximal compact group consisting of inner automorphisms on a nilpotent orbit is strongly visible if and only if it is spherical, namely, admitting an open orbit of a Borel subgroup. Further, we find a concrete description of a slice in the strongly visible action. As a corollary, we clarify a relationship among different notions of complex nilpotent orbits: actions of Borel subgroups (sphericity); multiplicity-free representations in regular functions; momentum maps; and actions of compact subgroups (strongly visible actions).
