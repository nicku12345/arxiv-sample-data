Kostka functions K^{\pm}_{\lambda, \mu}(t) associated to complex reflection groups are a generalization of Kostka polynomials, which are indexed by a pair \lambda, \mu of r-partitions and a sign +, -. It is expected that there exists a close connection between those Kostka functions and the intersection cohomology associated to the enhanced variety X of level r. In this paper, we study combinatorial properties of Kostka functions by making use of the geometry of X. In particular, we show that if \mu is of the form \mu = (-,\dots, -, \xi) and \lambda is arbitrary, K^-_{\lambda, \mu}(t) has a Lascoux-Sch\"utzenberger type combinatorial description.
