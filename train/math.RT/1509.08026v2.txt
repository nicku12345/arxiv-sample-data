Generalizing Schubert cells in type A and a cell decomposition if Springer fibres in type A found by L. Fresse we prove that varieties of complete flags in nilpotent representations of an oriented cycle admit an affine cell decomposition parametrized by multi-tableaux. We show that they carry a torus operation and describe the T-equivariant cohomology using Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson-theory. As an application of the cell decomposition we obtain a vector space basis of certain modules (for quiver Hecke algebras of nilpotent representations of this quiver), similar modules have been studied by Kato as analogues of standard modules.
