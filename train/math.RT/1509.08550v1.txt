In this survey article we review Kac-Moody and Heisenberg algebra actions on the categories \mathcal{O} of the rational Cherednik algebras associated to groups G(\ell,1,n). Using these actions we solve basic representation theoretic problems for these categories such as the classification of finite dimensional irreducible representations and computation of characters of the irreducibles.
