Let \mathfrak g be a complex reductive Lie algebra and V the underling vector space of a finite-dimensional representation of \mathfrak g. Then one can consider a new Lie algebra \mathfrak q=\mathfrak g{\ltimes} V, which is a semi-direct product of \mathfrak g and an Abelian ideal V. We outline several results on the algebra \mathbb C[\mathfrak q^*]^{\mathfrak q} of symmetries invariants of \mathfrak q and describe all semi-direct products related to the defining representation of \mathfrak{sl}_n with \mathbb C[\mathfrak q^*]^{\mathfrak q} being a free algebra.
