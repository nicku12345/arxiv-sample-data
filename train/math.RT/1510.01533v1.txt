We introduce a braid group action on l-tuple of rational functions for the finite-dimensional representations of Yangians Y(\mathfrak{g}), where \mathfrak{g} is a complex simple Lie algebra. It provides an efficient way to compute certain polynomials which allows us to provide a finite set of numbers at which the tensor product of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules of Yangians may fail to be cyclic.
