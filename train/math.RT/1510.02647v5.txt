We establish an explicit algebra isomorphism between the affine Yokonuma-Hecke algebra \widehat{Y}_{r,n}(q) and a direct sum of matrix algebras with coefficients in tensor products of affine Hecke algebras of type A. As an application of this result, we show that \widehat{Y}_{r,n}(q) is affine cellular in the sense of Koenig and Xi, and further prove that it has finite global dimension when the parameter q is not a root of the Poincar\'e polynomial. As another application, we also recover the modular representation theory of \widehat{Y}_{r,n}(q) previously obtained in [CW].
