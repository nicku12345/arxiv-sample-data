For a k-algebra A, a quiver Q, and an ideal I of kQ generated by monomial relations, let \Lambda: = A\otimes_k kQ/I. We introduce the monic representations of (Q, I) over A. We give properties of the structural maps of monic representations, and prove that the category {\rm mon}(Q, I, A) of the monic representations of (Q, I) over A is a resolving subcategory of {\rm rep}(Q, I, A). We introduce the condition {\rm(G)}. The main result claims that a \m-module is Gorenstein-projective if and only if it is a monic module satisfying {\rm(G)}. As consequences, the monic \m-modules are exactly the projective \m-modules if and only if A is semisimple; and they are exactly the Gorenstein-projective \m-modules if and only if A is selfinjective, and if and only if {\rm mon}(Q, I, A) is Frobenius.
