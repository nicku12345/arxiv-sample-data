Commutative sets of Jucys-Murphyelements for affine braid groups of A^{(1)},B^{(1)},C^{(1)},D^{(1)} types were defined. Construction of R-matrix representations of the affine braid group of type C^{(1)} and its distinguish commutative subgroup generated by the C^{(1)}-type Jucys--Murphy elements are given. We describe a general method to produce flat connections for the two-boundary quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations as necessary conditions for Sklyanin's type transfer matrix associated with the two-boundary multicomponent Zamolodchikov algebra to be invariant under the action of the C^{(1)}-type Jucys--Murphy elements. We specify our general construction to the case of the Birman--Murakami--Wenzl algebras. As an application we suggest a baxterization of the Dunkl--Cherednik elements Y's in the double affine Hecke algebra of type A.
