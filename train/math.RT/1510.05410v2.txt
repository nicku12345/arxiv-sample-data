In this paper, we establish connections between the first extensions of simple modules and certain filtrations of of standard modules in the setting of graded Hecke algebras. The filtrations involved are radical filtrations and Jantzen filtrations. Our approach involves the use of information from the Langlands classification as well as some deeper analysis on structure of some modules. Such modules arise from the image of a Knapp-Stein type intertwining operator and is a quotient of a generalized standard module.
