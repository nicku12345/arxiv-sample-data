Buan-Iyama-Reiten-Smith proved, based on Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky work, that the Jacobian algebra of two quivers with potential related by a QP-mutation are nearly Morita equivalent. They proved, using Axiom of Choice, that the natural functor \mu_k is an equivalence by showing that \mu_k is full, faithfull and dense. In this note we provide a quasi-inverse \mu_k^- to \mu_k without Axiom of Choice.
