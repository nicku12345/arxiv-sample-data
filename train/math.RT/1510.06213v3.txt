Let F be a non archimedean local field, and n_1 and n_2 two positive even integers. We prove that if \pi_1 and \pi_2 are two smooth representations of GL(n_1,F) and GL(n_2,F) respectively, both admitting a Shalika period, then the normalised parabolically induced representation \pi_1\times \pi_2 also admits a Shalika period. Combining this with the results of \cite{M-localBF}, we obtain as a corollary the classification of generic representations of GL(n,F) admitting a Shalika period when F has characteristic zero. This result is relevant to the study of the Jacquet-Shalika exterior square L factor.
