We prove that all convolution products of pairs of continuous orbital measures in rank one, compact symmetric spaces are absolutely continuous and determine which convolution products are in L^{2} (meaning, their density function is in L^{2}). Characterizations of the pairs whose convolution product is either absolutely continuous or in L^2 are given in terms of the dimensions of the corresponding double cosets. In particular, we prove that if G/K is not SU(2)/SO(2), then the convolution of any two regular orbital measures is in L^{2}, while in SU(2)/SO(2) there are no pairs of orbital measures whose convolution product is in L^{2}.
