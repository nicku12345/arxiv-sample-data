In this paper, we establish an explicit classification of length two extensions of tensor modules for the Witt algebra using the cohomology of the Witt algebra with coefficients in the module of the space of homomorphisms between the two modules of interest. To do this we extended our module to a module that has a compatible action of the commutative algebra of Laurent polynomials in one variable. In this setting, we are be able to directly compute all possible 1-cocycles.
