This paper addresses the representation theory of the insertion-elimination Lie algebra, a Lie algebra that can be naturally realized in terms of tree-inserting and tree-eliminating operations on rooted trees. The insertion-elimination algebra admits a triangular decomposition in the sense of Moody and Pianzola, and thus it is natural to define a Whittaker module corresponding to a given algebra homomorphism. Among other results, we show that the standard Whittaker module is simple given certain constraints on the corresponding algebra homomorphism.
