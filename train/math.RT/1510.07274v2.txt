We give a new and independent parameterization of the set of discrete series characters of an affine Hecke algebra \mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{v}}, in terms of a canonically defined basis \mathcal{B}_{gm} of a certain lattice of virtual elliptic characters of the underlying (extended) affine Weyl group. This classification applies to all semisimple affine Hecke algebras \mathcal{H}, and to all \mathbf{v}\in\mathcal{Q}, where \mathcal{Q} denotes the vector group of positive real (possibly unequal) Hecke parameters for \mathcal{H}. By analytic Dirac induction we define for each b\in \mathcal{B}_{gm} a continuous (in the sense of [OS2]) family \mathcal{Q}^{reg}_b:=\mathcal{Q}_b\backslash\mathcal{Q}_b^{sing}\ni\mathbf{v}\to\operatorname{Ind}_{D}(b;\mathbf{v}), such that \epsilon(b;\mathbf{v})\operatorname{Ind}_{D}(b;\mathbf{v}) (for some \epsilon(b;\mathbf{v})\in\{\pm 1\}) is an irreducible discrete series character of \mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{v}}. Here \mathcal{Q}^{sing}_b\subset\mathcal{Q} is a finite union of hyperplanes in \mathcal{Q}.   In the non-simply laced cases we show that the families of virtual discrete series characters \operatorname{Ind}_{D}(b;\mathbf{v}) are piecewise rational in the parameters \mathbf{v}. Remarkably, the formal degree of \operatorname{Ind}_{D}(b;\mathbf{v}) in such piecewise rational family turns out to be rational. This implies that for each b\in \mathcal{B}_{gm} there exists a universal rational constant d_b determining the formal degree in the family of discrete series characters \epsilon(b;\mathbf{v})\operatorname{Ind}_{D}(b;\mathbf{v}). We will compute the canonical constants d_b, and the signs \epsilon(b;\mathbf{v}). For certain geometric parameters we will provide the comparison with the Kazhdan-Lusztig-Langlands classification.
