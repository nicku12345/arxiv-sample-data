Frieze patterns of integers were studied by Conway and Coxeter. Let \mathscr{C} be the cluster category of Dynkin type A_n. Indecomposables in \mathscr{C} correspond to diagonals in an (n+3)-gon. Work done by Caldero and Chapoton showed that the Caldero-Chapoton map (which is a map dependent on a fixed object R of a category, and which goes from the set of objects of that category to \mathbb{Z}), when applied to the objects of \mathscr{C} can recover these friezes. This happens precisely when R corresponds to a triangulation of the (n+3)-gon. Later work by authors such as Bessenrodt, Holm, Jorgensen and Rubey generalised this connection with friezes further, now to d-angulations of the (n+3)-gon with R basic and rigid. In this paper, we extend these generalisations further still, to the case where the object R corresponds to a general Ptolemy diagram, i.e. R is basic and \textrm{add}(R) is the most general possible torsion class.
