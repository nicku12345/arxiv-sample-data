Let X be a smooth scheme with an action of a reductive algebraic group G over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero. We construct an action of the extended affine Braid group on the G-equivariant absolute derived category of matrix factorizations on the Grothendieck variety times T^*X with potential given by the Grothendieck-Springer resolution times the moment map composed with the natural pairing.
