Let G be a locally convex Lie group and \pi:G \to \mathrm{U}(\mathcal{H}) be a continuous unitary representation. \pi is called smooth if the space of \pi-smooth vectors \mathcal{H}^\infty\subset \mathcal{H} is dense. In this article we show that under certain conditions, concerning in particular the structure of the Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} of G, a continuous unitary representation of G is automatically smooth. As an application, this yields a dense space of smooth vectors for continuous positive energy representations of oscillator groups, double extensions of loop groups and the Virasoro group. Moreover we show the existence of a dense space of analytic vectors for the class of semibounded representations of Banach-Lie groups. Here \pi is called semibounded, if \pi is smooth and there exists a non-empty open subset U\subset\mathfrak{g} such that the operators i\mathrm{d}\pi(x) from the derived representation are uniformly bounded from above for x\in U.
