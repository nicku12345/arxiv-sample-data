This is an overview of our series of papers on the modular generalized Springer correspondence. It is an expansion of a lecture given by the second author in the Fifth Conference of the Tsinghua Sanya International Mathematics Forum, Sanya, December 2014, as part of the Master Lecture `Algebraic Groups and their Representations' Workshop honouring G. Lusztig. The material that has not appeared in print before includes some discussion of the motivating idea of modular character sheaves, and heuristic remarks about geometric functors of parabolic induction and restriction.
