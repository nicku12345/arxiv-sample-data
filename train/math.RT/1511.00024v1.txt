Given a complex semisimple Lie algebra {\mathfrak g} and a commutative {\mathbb C}-algebra A, let {\mathfrak g}[A] = {\mathfrak g} \otimes A be the corresponding generalized current algebra. In this paper we explore questions involving the computation and finite-dimensionality of extension groups for finite-dimensional {\mathfrak g}[A]-modules. Formulas for computing \operatorname{Ext}^{1} and \operatorname{Ext}^{2} between simple {\mathfrak g}[A]-modules are presented. As an application of these methods and of the use of the first cyclic homology, we completely describe \operatorname{Ext}^{2}_{{\mathfrak g}[t]}(L_{1},L_{2}) for {\mathfrak g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{2} when L_{1} and L_{2} are simple {\mathfrak g}[t]-modules that are each given by the tensor product of two evaluation modules.
