Recently, Panyushev raised five conjectures concerning the structure of certain root posets arising from \mathbb{Z}-gradings of simple Lie algebras. This paper aims to provide proofs for four of them. Our study also links these posets with Kostant-Macdonald identity, minuscule representations, Stembridge's "t=-1 phenomenon", and the cyclic sieving phenomenon due to Reiner, Stanton and White.
