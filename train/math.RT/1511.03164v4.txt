For a finite group G and an arbitrary commutative ring R, Brou\'e has placed a Frobenius exact structure on the category of finitely generated RG-modules by taking the exact sequences to be those that split upon restriction to the trivial subgroup. The corresponding stable category is then tensor triangulated. In this paper we examine the case R=S/t^n, where S is a discrete valuation ring having uniformising parameter t. We prove that the prime ideal spectrum (in the sense of Balmer) of this `relative' version of the stable module category of RG is a disjoint union of n copies of that for kG, where k is the residue field of S.
