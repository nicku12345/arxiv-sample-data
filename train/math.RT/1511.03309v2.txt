The Langlands correspondence of GL(2,F) over a non-Archimedean local field F of characteristic 0 has been well studied. The construction uses the theta correspondence. In this paper, we are going to describe explicitly how this construction is done. We will then provide new proofs to several properties of the correspondence. Including that the correspondence does not depend on the additive character introduced by the Weil representation.
