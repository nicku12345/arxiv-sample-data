A real Lie algebra with a compatible Hilbert space structure (in the sense that the scalar product is invariant) is called a Hilbert-Lie algebra. Such Lie algebras are natural infinite-dimensional analogues of the compact Lie algebras; in particular, any infinite-dimensional simple Hilbert-Lie algebra \mathfrak{k} is of one of the four classical types A_J, B_J, C_J or D_J for some infinite set J. Imitating the construction of affine Kac-Moody algebras, one can then consider affinisations of \mathfrak{k}, that is, double extensions of (twisted) loop algebras over \mathfrak{k}. Such an affinisation \mathfrak{g} of \mathfrak{k} possesses a root space decomposition with respect to some Cartan subalgebra \mathfrak{h}, whose corresponding root system yields one of the seven locally affine root systems (LARS) of type A_J^{(1)}, B^{(1)}_J, C^{(1)}_J, D_J^{(1)}, B_J^{(2)}, C_J^{(2)} or BC_J^{(2)}.   Let D\in\mathrm{der}(\mathfrak{g}) with \mathfrak{h}\subseteq\mathrm{ker}D (a diagonal derivation of \mathfrak{g}). Then every highest weight representation (\rho_{\lambda},L(\lambda)) of \mathfrak{g} with highest weight \lambda can be extended to a representation \widetilde{\rho}_{\lambda} of the semi-direct product \mathfrak{g}\rtimes \mathbb{R} D. In this paper, we characterise all pairs (\lambda,D) for which the representation \widetilde{\rho}_{\lambda} is of positive energy, namely, for which the spectrum of the operator -i\widetilde{\rho}_{\lambda}(D) is bounded from below.
