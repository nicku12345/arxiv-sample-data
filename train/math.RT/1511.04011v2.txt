In this note, we address a question raised by Kr\"otz on the classification of domains of holomorphy of irreducible admissible Banach representations for connected non-compact simple real Lie groups G. When G is not of Hermitian type, we give a complete description of the domains of holomorphy for irreducible admissible uniformly bounded representations on uniformly convex uniformly smooth Banach spaces and, in particular, for all irreducible uniformly bounded Hilbert representations. When the group G is Hermitian, we determine the domains of holomorphy only when the representations considered are highest or lowest weight representations.
