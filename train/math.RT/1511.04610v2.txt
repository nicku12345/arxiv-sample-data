In this paper, we answer the question of when the subcategory of semi-stable representations is the same for two rational vectors for an acyclic quiver. This question has been previously answered by Ingalls, Paquette, and Thomas in the tame case in [10]. Here we take a more invariant theoretic approach, to answer this question in general. We recover the known result in the tame case.
