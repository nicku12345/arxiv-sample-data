We study the ring of regular functions of classical spherical orbits R(\mathcal{O}) for G = Sp(2n,\mathbb{C}). In particular, treating G as a real Lie group with maximal compact subgroup K, we focus on a quantization model of \mathcal{O} when \mathcal{O} is the nilpotent orbit (2^{2p}1^{2q}). With this model, we verify a conjecture by McGovern and another conjecture by Achar and Sommers for such orbits. Assuming the results in [Barbasch 2008], we will also verify the Achar-Sommers conjecture for a larger class of nilpotent orbits.
