For reductive symmetric spaces G/H of split rank one we identify a class of minimal parabolic subgroups for which certain cuspidal integrals of Harish-Chandra - Schwartz functions are absolutely convergent. Using these integrals we introduce a notion of cusp forms and investigate its relation with representations of the discrete series for G/H.
