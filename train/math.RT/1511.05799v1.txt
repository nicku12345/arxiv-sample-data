Let G be a non-compact group, K the compact subgroup fixed by a Cartan involution and assume G/K is an exceptional, symmetric space, one of Cartan type E,F  or G. We find the minimal integer, L(G), such that any convolution product of L(G) continuous, K-bi-invariant measures on G is absolutely continuous with respect to Haar measure. Further, any product of L(G) double cosets has non-empty interior. The number L(G) is either 2 or 3% , depending on the Cartan type, and in most cases is strictly less than the rank of G.
