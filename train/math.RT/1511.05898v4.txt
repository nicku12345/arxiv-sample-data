For k \ge 1 we consider the K-algebra H(k) := H(C,kD,\Omega) associated to a symmetrizable Cartan matrix C, a symmetrizer D, and an orientation \Omega of C, which was defined in Part 1. We construct and analyse a reduction functor from rep(H(k)) to rep(H(k-1)). As a consequence we show that the canonical decomposition of rank vectors for H(k) does not depend on k, and that the rigid locally free H(k)-modules are up to isomorphism in bijection with the rigid locally free H(k-1)-modules. Finally, we show that for a rigid locally free H(k)-module of a given rank vector the Euler characteristic of the variety of flags of locally free submodules with fixed ranks of the subfactors does not depend on the choice of k.
