The authors have proved in [J. Algebra Appl. 14 (2015), no. 6] that the size of a stratifying system over a finite-dimensional hereditary path algebra A is at most n, where n is the number of isomorphism classes of simple A-modules. Moreover, if A is of Euclidean type a stratifying system over A has at most n-2 regular modules. In this work, we construct a family of stratifying systems of size n with a maximal number of regular elements, over the hereditary path algebra with quiver \widetilde{\mathbb {A}}_{p,q} , canonically oriented.
