The aim of the present paper is to obtain a classification of all the irreducible modular representations of the symmetric group on n letters of dimension at most n^3, including dimension formulae. This is achieved by improving an idea, originally due to G. James, to get hands on dimension bounds, by building on the current knowledge about decomposition numbers of symmetric groups and their associated Iwahori-Hecke algebras, and by employing a mixture of theory and computation.
