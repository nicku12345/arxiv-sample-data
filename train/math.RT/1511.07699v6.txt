For each integer t a tensor category V_t is constructed, such that exact tensor functors V_t \longrightarrow C classify dualizable t-dimensional objects in C not annihilated by any Schur functor. This means that V_t is the "abelian envelope" of the Deligne category Rep(GL_t). Any tensor functor Rep(GL_t)\longrightarrow C is proved to factor either through V_t or through one of the classical categories Rep(GL(m|n)) with m-n=t. The universal property of V_t implies that it is equivalent to the categories   Rep_{Rep(GL_{t_1})\otimes Rep(GL_{t_2})}(GL(X),\epsilon), (t=t_1+t_2, t_1 not integer) suggested by Deligne as candidates for the role of abelian envelope.
