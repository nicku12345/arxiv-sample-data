We define Lie algebra cohomology associated with the half-Dirac operators for representations of rational Cherednik algebras and show that it has property described in the Casselman-Osborne Theorem by establishing a version of the Vogan's conjecture for the half-Dirac operators. Moreover, we study the relationship between Lie algebra cohomology and Dirac cohomology in analogy of the representations for semisimple Lie algebras.
