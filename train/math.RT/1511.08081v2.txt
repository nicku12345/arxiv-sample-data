Let k be a field and let \Lambda be a finite dimensional k-algebra. We prove that every bounded complex V^\bullet of finitely generated \Lambda-modules has a well-defined versal deformation ring R(\Lambda,V^\bullet) which is a complete local commutative Noetherian k-algebra with residue field k. We also prove that nice two-sided tilting complexes between \Lambda and another finite dimensional k-algebra \Gamma preserve these versal deformation rings. Additionally, we investigate stable equivalences of Morita type between self-injective algebras in this context. We apply these results to the derived equivalence classes of the members of a particular family of algebras of dihedral type that were introduced by Erdmann and shown by Holm to be not derived equivalent to any block of a group algebra.
