In a previous article the second author together with A. Pasquale determined the spectrum of the Cos^\lambda transform on smooth functions on the Grassmann manifolds G_{p,n+1}. This article extends those results to line bundles over certain Grassmannians. In particular we define the Cos^\lambda transform on smooth sections of homogeneous line bundles overG_{p,n+1} and show that it is an intertwining operator between generalized (\chi-spherical) principal series representations induced from a maximal parabolic subgroup of \mathrm{SL} (n+1, \mathbb{K}). Then we use the spectrum generating method to determine the K-spectrum of the Cos^\lambda transform.
