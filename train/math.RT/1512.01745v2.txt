Let \mathfrak{r} be a finite dimensional complex Lie superalgebra with a non-degenerate super-symmetric invariant bilinear form, let \mathfrak{p} be a finite dimensional complex super vector space with a non-degenerate super-symmetric bilinear form, and let \nu: \mathfrak{r}\rightarrow\mathfrak{osp}(\mathfrak{p}) be a Lie superalgebra homomorphism. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for \mathfrak{r}\oplus\mathfrak{p} to be a quadratic Lie superalgebra. The criterion obtained is an analogue of a constancy condition given by Kostant in the Lie algebra setting. As an application, we prove an analogue of the Parthasarathy's formula for the square of the Dirac operator attached to a pair of quadratic Lie superalgebras.
