By the works of Yu, Kim and Hakim-Murnaghan, we have a parameterization and construction of all supercuspidal representations of a reductive p-adic group in terms of supercuspidal data, when p is sufficiently large. In this paper, we will define a correspondence of supercuspidal data via moment maps and theta correspondences over finite fields. Then we will show that local theta correspondences between supercuspidal representations are completely described by this notion. In Appendix B, we give a short proof of a result of Pan on "depth preservation".
