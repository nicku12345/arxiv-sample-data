This paper describes the module categories for a family of generic Hecke algebras that specialize to the complex reflection groups G(r,1,n) and to the certain endomorphism rings of permutation characters of finite general linear groups. In particular, complete sets of inequivalent, irreducible modules for semisimple specializations of these algebras are constructed.
