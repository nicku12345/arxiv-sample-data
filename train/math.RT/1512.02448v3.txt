We give an explicit construction of all complex continuous irreducible characters of the group {\rm SL}_1(D), where D is a division algebra of prime degree \ell over a local field of odd residual characteristic different than \ell. For \ell odd, we show that all such characters of {\rm SL}_1(D) are induced from linear characters of compact-open subgroups of {\rm SL}_1(D). We also compute an explicit formula for the representation zeta function of {\rm SL}_1(D).
