In this note we collect several characterizations of unitary representations (\pi, \mathcal{H}) of a finite dimensional Lie group G which are trace class, i.e., for each compactly supported smooth function f on G, the operator \pi(f) is trace class. In particular we derive the new result that, for some m \in \mathbb{N}, all operators \pi(f), f \in C^m_c(G), are trace class. As a consequence the corresponding distribution character \theta_\pi is of finite order. We further show \pi is trace class if and only if every operator A, which is smoothing in the sense that A\mathcal{H}\subseteq \mathcal{H}^\infty, is trace class and that this in turn is equivalent to the Fr\'echet space \mathcal{H}^\infty being nuclear, which in turn is equivalent to the realizability of the Gaussian measure of \mathcal{H} on the space \mathcal{H}^{-\infty} of distribution vectors. Finally we show that, even for infinite dimensional Fr\'echet-Lie groups, A and A^* are smoothing if and only if A is a Schwartz operator, i.e., all products of A with operators from the derived representation are bounded.
