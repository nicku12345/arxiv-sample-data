Let \pi be a Speh module of \mathbf{GL}(2n,\mathbb{R}) based on a discrete series of \textbf{GL}(2,\mathbb{R}). The aim of this paper is to build a chain complex of \pi by direct sum of auto-duals standard modules, \begin{align}\label{eq:abstract} 0\rightarrow \pi\rightarrow X_{0}\rightarrow \cdots\rightarrow X_{i}\xrightarrow{\phi_{i}} X_{i+1}\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow 0. \end{align} The standard modules in the previous chain are the auto-duals standard modules which occurs in the Johnson's resolution of \pi, they are parameterized by the set of involutions \mathfrak{I}_{n} of the symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_{n}. Under this parametrization one can show that the inversion of the Bruhat order in \mathfrak{I}_{n} coincide with the Vogan order defined over the set of irreducible representations of \mathbf{GL}(\mathbb{R}). This allows us to reduce the construction of the chain complex to the study of combinatorial properties of the Bruhat order on \mathfrak{I}_{n}. In the last chapter we show that the chain complex of \pi, for n\leq 4, is \theta-exact i.e. the twisted trace of \ker\phi_{i+1}/\text{im}\phi_{i} is trivial. This allows us to write the twisted trace of \pi as a linear combination of twisted traces of standard modules, wich implies for \pi one of the the main results of the paper, \textit{Paquets d'Arthur des Groupes classiques et unitaires}.
