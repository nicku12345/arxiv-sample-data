Let \mathscr N be a 2-step nilpotent Lie algebra endowed with non-degenerate scalar product \langle.\,,.\rangle and let \mathscr N=V\oplus_{\perp}Z, where Z is the centre of the Lie algebra and V its orthogonal complement with respect to the scalar product. We study the classification of the Lie algebras for which the space V arises as a representation space of a Clifford algebra \Cl(\mathbb R^{r,s}) and the representation map J\colon \Cl(\mathbb R^{r,s})\to(V) is related to the Lie algebra structure by \langle J_zv,w\rangle=\langle z,[v,w]\rangle for all z\in \mathbb R^{r,s} and v,w\in V. The classification is based on the range of parameters r and s and is completed for the Clifford modules V, having minimal possible dimension, that are not necessary irreducible. We find the necessary condition for the existence of a Lie algebra isomorphism according to the range of integer parameters 0\leq r,s<\infty. We present the constructive proof for the isomorphism map for isomorphic Lie algebras and defined the class of non-isomorphic Lie algebras.
