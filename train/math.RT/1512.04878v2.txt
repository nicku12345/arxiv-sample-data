The parabolic category \mathcal O for affine {\mathfrak{gl}}_N at level -N-e admits a structure of a categorical representation of \widetilde{\mathfrak{sl}}_e with respect to some endofunctors E and F. This category contains a smaller category \mathbf A that categorifies the higher level Fock space. We prove that the functors E and F in the category \mathbf A are Koszul dual to Zuckerman functors.   The key point of the proof is to show that the functor F for the category \mathbf A at level -N-e can be decomposed in terms of components of the functor F for the category \mathbf A at level -N-e-1. To prove this, we use the approach of categorical representations. We prove a general fact about categorical representations: a category with an action of \widetilde{\mathfrak sl}_{e+1} contains a subcategory with an action of \widetilde{\mathfrak sl}_{e}. To prove this claim, we construct an isomorphism between the KLR algebra associated with the quiver A_{e-1}^{(1)} and a subquotient of the KLR algebra associated with the quiver A_{e}^{(1)}.
