In this paper we construct two kinds of infinite-dimensional 3-Lie algebras from a given commutative associative algebra, and show that they are all canonical Nambu 3-Lie algebras. We relate their inner derivation algebras to Witt algebras, and then study the regular representations of these 3-Lie algebras and the natural representations of the inner derivation algebras. In particular, for the second kind of 3-Lie algebras, we find that their regular representations are Harish-Chandra modules, and the inner derivation algebras give rise to intermediate series modules of the Witt algebras and contain the smallest full toroidal Lie algebras without center.
