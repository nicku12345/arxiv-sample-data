We study rewriting properties of the column presentation of plactic monoid for any semisimple Lie algebra such as termination and confluence. Littelmann described this presentation using L-S paths generators. Thanks to the shapes of tableaux, we show that this presentation is finite and convergent. We obtain as a corollary that plactic monoids for any semisimple Lie algebra satisfy homological finiteness properties.
