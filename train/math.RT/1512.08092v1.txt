Let \mathfrak g be a simple Lie algebra and \mathfrak{Ab} the poset of all abelian ideals of a fixed Borel subalgebra of \mathfrak g. If \mathfrak a\in\mathfrak{Ab}, then the normaliser of \mathfrak a is a standard parabolic subalgebra of \mathfrak g. We give an explicit description of the normaliser for a class of abelian ideals that includes all maximal abelian ideals. We also elaborate on a relationship between abelian ideals and \mathbb Z-gradings of \mathfrak g associated with their normalisers.
