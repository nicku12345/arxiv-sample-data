Let G be a reductive p-adic group. Let \Phi be an invariant distribution on G lying in the Bernstein center Z(G). We prove that \Phi is supported on compact elements in G if and only if it defines a constant function on every component of the set Irr(G); in particular, we show that the space of all elements of Z(G) supported on compact elements is a subalgebra of Z(G). Our proof is a slight modiification of the arguments of J.F.Dat who proved our result in one direction.
