In the present paper we classify all irreducible continuous representations of the simple linearly compact n-Lie superalgebra of type W. The classification is based on a bijective correspondence between the continuous representations of the n-Lie algebras W^n and continuous representations of the Lie algebra of Cartan type W_{n-1}, on which some two-sided ideal acts trivially.
