Using deformation theory, Braverman and Joseph obtained an alternative characterisation of the Joseph ideal for simple Lie algebras, which included even type A. In this note we extend that characterisation to define a remarkable quadratic ideal for sl(m|n). When m-n>2 we prove the ideal is primitive and can also be characterised similarly to the construction of the Joseph ideal by Garfinkle.
