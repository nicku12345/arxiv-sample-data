Let G be a complex linear algebraic group, \mathfrak{g}=\Lie(G) its Lie algebra and e\in\mathfrak{g} a nilpotent element. Vust's theorem says that in case of G=\GL(V), the algebra \mbox{End}_{G_e}(V^{\otimes d}), where G_e\subset G is the stabilizer of e under the adjoint action, is generated by the image of the natural action of d-th symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_d and the linear maps \{1^{\otimes (i-1)}\otimes e\otimes1^{\otimes (d-i)}|i=1,\ldots,d\}. In this paper, we generalize this theorem to G=\O(V) and \SP(V) for nilpotent element e with \overline{G\cdot e} being normal. As an application, we study the higher Schur-Weyl duality in the sense of \cite{BK2} for types B, C and D, which establishes a relationship between W-algebras and degenerate affine braid algebras.
