Let B be a Borel subgroup of a semisimple algebraic group G and let \mathfrak m be an abelian nilradical in \mathfrak b={\rm Lie} (B). Using subsets of strongly orthogonal roots in the subset of positive roots corresponding to \mathfrak m, D. Panyushev \cite{Pan} gives in particular classification of B-orbits in \mathfrak m and {\mathfrak m}^* and states general conjectures on the closure and dimensions of the B-orbits in both \mathfrak m and {\mathfrak m}^* in terms of involutions of the Weyl group. Using Pyasetskii correspondence between B-orbits in \mathfrak m and {\mathfrak m}^* he shows the equivalence of these two conjectures. In this Note we prove his conjecture in types B_n, C_n and D_n for adjoint case.
