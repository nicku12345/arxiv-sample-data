Let G be a semisimple algebraic group with Lie algebra \mathfrak g. For a nilpotent G-orbit \mathcal O\subset\mathfrak g, let d_\mathcal O denote the maximal dimension of a subspace V\subset \mathfrak g that is contained in the closure of \mathcal O. In this note, we prove that d_\mathcal O \le \frac{1}{2}\dim\mathcal O and this upper bound is attained if and only if \mathcal O is a Richardson orbit. Furthermore, if V is B-stable and \dim V= \frac{1}{2}\dim\mathcal O, then V is the nilradical of a polarisation of \mathcal O. Every nilpotent orbit closure has a distinguished B-stable subspace constructed via an \mathfrak{sl}_2-triple, which is called the Dynkin ideal. We then characterise the nilpotent orbits \mathcal O such that the Dynkin ideal (1) has the minimal dimension among all B-stable subspaces \mathfrak c such that \mathfrak c\cap\mathcal O is dense in \mathfrak c, or (2) is the only B-stable subspace \mathfrak c such that \mathfrak c\cap\mathcal O is dense in \mathfrak c.
