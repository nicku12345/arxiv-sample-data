We give new interpretations of the Deligne categories \underline{Rep}(GL_t) and \underline{Rep}(S_t) (and their abelian envelopes) over \mathbb{C} in terms of modular representations of general linear and symmetric groups of large rank in large characteristic. In particular we make sense of the sentence "\underline{Rep}(S_n) is the limit of Rep(S_{p+n}) over \bar{\mathbb{F}}_p as p goes to infinity". We then give examples of how to pass results between these different settings.
