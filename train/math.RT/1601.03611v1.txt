The main aim of this paper is to classify the irreducible admissible representations of {\rm GL}_{4}(F) and {\rm GL}_{6}(F) for a nonarchimedean local field F, which bear a nontrivial linear form invariant under the groups {\rm Sp}_{4}(F) and {\rm Sp}_{6}(F) respectively. We propose a few conjectures for the general case.
