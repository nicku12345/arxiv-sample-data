Using the general framework of polynomial representations defined by Doty and generalizing the definition given by Doty, Nakano and Peters for G = \mathrm{GL}_n, we consider polynomial representations of G_r T for an arbitrary closed reductive subgroup scheme G \subseteq \mathrm{GL}_n and a maximal torus T of G in positive characteristic. We give sufficient conditions on G making a classification of simple polynomial G_r T-modules similar to the case G = \mathrm{GL}_n possible and apply this to recover the corresponding result for \mathrm{GL}_n with a different proof, extending it to symplectic similitude groups, Levi subgroups of \mathrm{GL}_n and, in a weaker form, to odd orthogonal similitude groups. We also consider orbits of the affine Weyl group and give a condition for equivalence of blocks of polynomial representations for G_r T in the case G = \mathrm{GL}_n.
