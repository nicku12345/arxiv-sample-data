We develop a reduction procedure which provides an equivalence from an arbitrary block of the BGG category for the queer Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{q}(n) to a "\mathbb{Z}\pm s-weights" (s\in \mathbb{C}) block of a BGG category for finite direct sum of queer Lie superalgebras. We give descriptions of blocks. We also establish equivalences between certain maximal parabolic subcategories for \mathfrak{q}(n) and blocks of atypicality-one of the category of finite-dimensional modules for \mathfrak{gl}(\ell|n-\ell).
