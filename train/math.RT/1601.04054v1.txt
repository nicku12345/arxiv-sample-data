The "No Gap Conjecture" of Br\"ustle-Dupont-P\'erotin states that the set of lengths of maximal green sequences for hereditary algebras over an algebraically closed field has no gaps. This follows from a stronger conjecture that any two maximal green sequences can be "polygonally deformed" into each other. We prove this stronger conjecture for all tame hereditary algebras over any field.
