The computation of Kronecker coefficients is a challenging problem with a variety of applications. In this paper we present an approach based on methods from symplectic geometry and residue calculus. We outline a general algorithm for the problem and then illustrate its effectiveness in several interesting examples. Significantly, our algorithm does not only compute individual Kronecker coefficients, but also symbolic formulas that are valid on an entire polyhedral chamber. As a byproduct, we are able to compute several Hilbert series.
