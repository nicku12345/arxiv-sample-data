We prove an analogue of James-Donkin row removal theorems for arbitrary diagrammatic Cherednik algebras. This is one of the first results concerning the (graded) decomposition numbers of these algebras over fields of arbitrary characteristic. As a special case, our results yield a new reduction theorem for graded decomposition numbers and extension groups for cyclotomic q-Schur algebras.
