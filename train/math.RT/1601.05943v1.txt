In this paper we study extensions between Cohen-Macaulay modules for algebras arising in the categorifications of Grassmannian cluster algebras. We prove that rank 1 modules are periodic, and we give explicit formulas for the computation of the period based solely on the rim of the rank 1 module in question. We determine {\rm Ext}^i(L_I, L_J) for arbitrary rank 1 modules L_I and L_J. An explicit combinatorial algorithm is given for computation of {\rm Ext}^i(L_I, L_J) when i is odd, and for i even, we show that {\rm Ext}^i(L_I, L_J) is cyclic over the centre, and we give an explicit formula for its computation. At the end of the paper we give a vanishing condition of {\rm Ext}^i(L_I, L_J) for any i>0.
