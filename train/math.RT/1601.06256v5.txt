We consider the Kronecker algebra A=\mathcal{O}[X, Y]/(X^2, Y^2), where \mathcal{O} is a complete discrete valuation ring. Since A \otimes\kappa is a special biserial algebra, where \kappa is the residue field of \mathcal{O}, one can compute a complete list of indecomposable A\otimes\kappa-modules. For each indecomposable A\otimes\kappa-module, we obtain a special kind of A-lattices called "Heller lattices". In this paper, we determine the non-periodic component of a variant of the stable Auslander--Reiten quiver for the category of A-lattices that contains "Heller lattices". Moreover, we give the strong restrictions on stable Auslander--Reiten quivers for symmetric orders over a complete discrete valuation ring.
