We study weakly symmetric special biserial algebras of infinite representation type. We show that usually some socle deformation of such an algebra has non-periodic bounded modules. The exceptions are precisely the algebras whose Brauer graph is a tree with no multiple edges. If the algebra has a non-periodic bounded module then its Hochschild cohomology cannot satisfy the finite generation property (Fg).
