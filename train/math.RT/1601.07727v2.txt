We consider the relationship between the relative stable category of Benson, Iyengar, and Krause and the usual singularity category for group algebras with coefficients in a commutative noetherian ring. When the coefficient ring is self-injective we show that these categories share a common, relatively large, Verdier quotient. At the other extreme, when the coefficient ring has finite global dimension, there is a semi-orthogonal decomposition, due to Poulton, relating the two categories. We prove that this decomposition is partially compatible with the monoidal structure and study the morphism it induces on spectra.
