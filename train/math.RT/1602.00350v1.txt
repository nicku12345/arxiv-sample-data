We show that the Hilbert series of the projective variety X=P(O_{min}), corresponding to the minimal nilpotent orbit \mathcal O_{min}, is universal in the sense of Vogel: it is written uniformly for all simple Lie algebras in terms of Vogel's parameters \alpha,\beta,\gamma and represents a special case of the generalized hypergeometric function {}_{4}F_{3}. A universal formula for the degree of X is then deduced.
