We study simple non-weight {\mathfrak{sl}}(2)-modules which are finitely generated as {\mathbb C}[z]-modules. We show that they are described in terms of semilinear endomorphisms and prove that the Smith type induces a stratification on the set of these {\mathfrak{sl}}(2)-modules, providing thus new invariants. Moreover, we show that there is a notion of duality for these type of {\mathfrak{sl}}(2)-modules. Finally, we show that there are simple non-weight {\mathfrak{sl}}(2)-modules of arbitrary rank by constructing a whole new family of them.
