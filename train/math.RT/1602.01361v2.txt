The complexity of a module is the rate of growth of the minimal projective resolution of the module while the z-complexity is the rate of growth of the number of indecomposable summands at each step in the resolution. Let \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{osp}(k|2) (k>2) be the type II orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra of types B or D. In this paper, we compute the complexity and the z-complexity of the simple finite-dimensional \mathfrak{g}-supermodules. We then give geometric interpretations using support and associated varieties for these complexities.
