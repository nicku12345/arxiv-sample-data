The associative ring R(P(t))=\mathbb C[t^{\pm1},u \,|\, u^2=P(t)], where P(t)=\sum_{i=0}^na_it^i=\prod_{k=1}^n(t-\alpha_i) with \alpha_i\in\mathbb C pairwise distinct, is the coordinate ring of a hyperelliptic curve. The Lie algebra \mathcal{R}(P(t))=\text{Der}(R(P(t))) of derivations is called the hyperelliptic Lie algebra associated to P(t).   In this paper we describe the universal central extension of \text{Der}(R(P(t))) in terms of certain families of polynomials which in a particular case are associated Legendre polynomials. Moreover we describe certain families of polynomials that arise in the study of the group of units for the ring R(P(t)) where P(t)=t^4-2bt^2+1. In this study pairs of Chebychev polynomials (U_n,T_n) arise as particular cases of a pairs (r_n,s_n) with r_n+s_n\sqrt{P(t)} a unit in R(P(t)). We explicitly describe these polynomial pairs as coefficients of certain generating functions and show certain of these polynomials satisfy particular second order linear differential equations.
