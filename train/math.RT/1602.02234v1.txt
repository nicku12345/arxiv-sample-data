Using the relative derived categories, we prove that if an Artin algebra A has a module T with {\rm inj.dim}T<\infty such that ^\perp T is finite, then the bounded derived category D^b({\rm mod}A) admits a categorical resolution; and that for CM-finite Gorenstein algebra, such a categorical resolution is weakly crepant.
