In the paper [P. Achar, "On the equivariant K-theory of the nilpotent cone in the general linear group," Represent. Theory 8 (2004), 180-211], the author gave a combinatorial algorithm for computing the Lusztig-Vogan bijection for GL(n,\mathbb{C}). However, that paper failed to mention one easy case that may sometimes arise, making the description of the algorithm incomplete. This note fills in that gap.
