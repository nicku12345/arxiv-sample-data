We establish a maximal parabolic version of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture \cite[Conjecture 5.10]{CKW} for the BGG category \mathcal{O}_{k,\zeta} of \mathfrak{q}(n)-modules of "\pm \zeta-weights", where k\leq n and \zeta\in\mathbb{C} \setminus \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{Z}. As a consequence, the irreducible characters of these \mathfrak{q}(n)-modules in this maximal parabolic category are given by the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of type A Lie algebras. As an application, closed character formulas for a class of \mathfrak{q}(n)-modules resembling polynomial and Kostant modules of the general linear Lie superalgebras are obtained.
