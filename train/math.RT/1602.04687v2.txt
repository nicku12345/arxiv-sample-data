We find all values of k\in \mathbb C, for which the embedding of the maximal affine vertex algebra in a simple minimal W-algebra W_k(\mathfrak g,\theta) is conformal, where \mathfrak g is a basic simple Lie superalgebra and -\theta its minimal root. In particular, it turns out that if W_k(\mathfrak g,\theta) does not collapse to its affine part, then the possible values of these k are either -\frac{2}{3} h^\vee or -\frac{h^\vee-1}{2}, where h^\vee is the dual Coxeter number of \mathfrak g for the normalization (\theta,\theta)=2. As an application of our results, we present a realization of simple affine vertex algebra V_{-\tfrac{n+1}{2} } (sl(n+1)) inside of the tensor product of the vertex algebra W_{\tfrac{n-1}{2}} (sl(2| n), \theta) (also called the Bershadsky-Knizhnik algebra) with a lattice vertex algebra.
