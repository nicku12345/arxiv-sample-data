Let F be a non archimedean local field of characteristic not 2. Let D be a division algebra of dimension d^2 over its center F, and E a quadratic extension of F. If m is a positive integer, to a character \chi of E^*, one can attach the Steinberg representation St(\chi) of G=GL(m,D\otimes_F E). Let H be the group GL(m,D), we prove that St(\chi) is H-distinguished if and only if \chi_{|F^*} is the quadratic character \eta_{E/F}^{md-1}, where \eta_{E/F} is the character of F^* with kernel the norms of E^*. We also get multiplicity one for the space of invariant linear forms. As a corollary, we see that the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence preserves distinction for Steinberg representations.
