Let \mathcal{B}_r be the (r+1)-dimensional quotient Lie algebra of the positive part of the Virasoro algebra \mathcal{V}. Irreducible \mathcal{B}_r-modules were used to construct irreducible Whittaker modules in [MZ2] and irreducible weight modules with infinite dimensional weight spaces over \mathcal{V} in [LLZ].In the present paper, we construct non-weight Virasoro modules   F(M, \Omega(\lambda,\beta)) from irreducible \mathcal{B}_r-modules M and (\mathcal{A},\mathcal{V})-modules \Omega(\lambda,\beta).   We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the Virasoro module F(M, \Omega(\lambda,\beta)) to be irreducible. Using the weighting functor introduced by J. Nilsson, we also we also give the isomorphism criterion for two F(M, \Omega(\lambda,\beta)).
