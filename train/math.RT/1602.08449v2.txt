We give a gentle introduction to the concept of folding. That is, we provide an elementary discussion of equivariant categories, their weighted Grothendieck groups, and the technical aspects of computing with them. We then perform the computations required to confirm that quasi-split Hecke algebras with unequal parameters are categorified by equivariant Soergel bimodules, in almost every case.
