We prove that the parabolic induction functor on BGG-category \mathcal{O} associated to a complex reductive Lie algebra is gradable, that is, lifts to graded category \mathcal{O} as constructed by Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel. Graded category \mathcal{O} is equivalent to a category of stratified mixed Tate motives on a corresponding flag variety as recently defined by Soergel-Wendt. The graded version of parabolic induction is induced by a geometric parabolic induction functor we construct on the level of stratified mixed Tate motives. We also describe the effect of parabolic induction on the level of Soergel modules.
