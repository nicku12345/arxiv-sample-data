Let \mathcal{J} be the exceptional Jordan algebra and V=\mathcal{J}\oplus \mathcal{J}. We construct an equivariant map from V to \mathrm{Hom}_k(\mathcal{J}\otimes \mathcal{J},\mathcal{J}) defined by homogeneous polynomials of degree 8 such that if x\in V is a generic point, then the image of x is the structure constant of the isotope of \mathcal{J} corresponding to x. We also give an alternative way to define the isotope corresponding to a generic point of \mathcal{J} by an equivariant map from \mathcal{J} to the space of trilinear forms.
