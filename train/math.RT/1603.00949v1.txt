Let \Gamma^{n} be the cone of an (n-1)-complete algebra over an algebraically closed field k. In this paper, we prove that if the bound quiver (Q_{n},\rho_{n}) of \Gamma^{n} is a truncation from the bound McKay quiver (Q_{G},\rho_{G}) of a finite subgroup G of GL(n,k), the bound quiver (Q_{n+1}, \rho_{n+1}) of \Gamma^{n+1}, the cone of \Gamma^{n}, is a truncation from the bound McKay quiver (Q_{\widetilde{G}},\rho_{\widetilde{G}}) of \widetilde{G}, where \widetilde{G}\cong G\times \mathbb{Z}_{m} for some m\in \mathbb{N}.
