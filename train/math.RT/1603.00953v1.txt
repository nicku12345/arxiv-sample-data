Let A be a finite dimensional G-graded algebra with G a finite group, and A\# k[G]^{\ast} be the smash product of A with the group G. Our results can be stated as follows: (1) If A is a self-injective algebra and separably graded, then the dimensions of triangulated categories \underline{\rm mod}A and \underline{\rm mod}A\# k[G]^{\ast} are equal. In particular, we obtain that the representation dimension of A\# k[G]^{\ast} is at least the dimension of triangulated category \underline{\rm mod}A plus 2; (2) Generally, if A is a k-algebra and separably graded, then the Oppermann dimensions of A and A\# k[G]^{\ast} are equal. In particular, we obtain that the representation dimension of A\# k[G]^{\ast} is at least the Oppermann dimension of A plus 2. In the end, we give two examples to illustrate our results.
