In this survey article we summarize the current state of research in representation stability theory. We look at three different, yet related, approaches, using (1) the category of FI-modules, (2) Schur-Weyl duality, and (3) finitely-generated modules over certain infinite dimensional vector spaces. The main example is the stability of representations of the symmetric group, though there have also been some notable generalizations of representation stability to other groups. This work summarizes the research that both authors engaged in over the course of the summer of 2015.
