We establish analogues of Hardy's theorem for Gabor transform on locally compact abelian groups, Euclidean motion group and several general classes of nilpotent Lie groups which include Heisenberg groups, thread-like nilpotent Lie groups, 2-NPC nilpotent Lie groups and low-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups.
