In this paper we prove the conjecture of Lusztig in "Generic character sheaves on groups over \mathbf{k}[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^r)." Given a reductive group over \mathbb{F}_q for some r\geq 2, there is a notion of a character sheaf defined in "Character sheaves and generalizations" by Lusztig. On the other hand, there is also a geometric analogue of the character constructed by G\'erardin. The conjecture states that the two constructions are equivalent, which Lusztig also proved for r=2, 3, 4. Here we generalize his method to prove this conjecture for general r. As a corollary we prove that the characters derived from these two complexes are equal.
