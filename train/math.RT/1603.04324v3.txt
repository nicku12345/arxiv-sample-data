We give a class of finite subgroups G<SL(n, k) for which the skew-group algebra k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]\#G does not admit the grading structure of a higher preprojective algebra. Namely, we prove that if a finite group G<SL(n, k) is conjugate to a finite subgroup of SL(n_1, k)\times SL(n_2, k), for some n_1, n_2\geq 1, then the skew-group algebra k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\#G is not Morita equivalent to a higher preprojective algebra. This is related to the preprojective algebra structure on the tensor product of two Koszul bimodule Calabi-Yau algebras. We prove that such an algebra cannot be endowed with a grading structure as required for a higher preprojective algebra.   Moreover, we construct explicitly the bound quiver of the higher preprojective algebra over a finite-dimensional Koszul algebra of finite global dimension. We show in addition that preprojective algebras over higher representation-infinite Koszul algebras are derivation-quotient algebras whose relations are given by a superpotential.
