We show that if T is a simple non-negatively graded regular vertex operator algebra with a nonsingular invariant bilinear form and \sigma is a finite order automorphism of T, then the fixed-point vertex operator subalgebra T^\sigma is also regular. This yields regularity for fixed point vertex operator subalgebras under the action of any finite solvable group. As an application, we obtain an SL_2(\mathbb{Z})-compatibility between twisted twining characters for commuting finite order automorphisms of holomorphic vertex operator algebras. This resolves one of the principal claims in the Generalized Moonshine conjecture.
