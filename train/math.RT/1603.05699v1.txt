A key result in a 2004 paper by S. Arkhipov, R. Bezrukavnikov, and V. Ginzburg compares the bounded derived category of modules for the principal block of a Lusztig quantum enveloping algebra at anroot of unity with an explicit subcategory of the bounded derived category of integrable type 1 modules for a Borel part of that algebra. Specifically, according to this Induction Theorem the right derived functor of induction yields an equivalence of triangulated categories. The authors ABG of that paper suggest a similar result holds for algebraic groups in positive characteristic p, and this paper provides a statement with proof for such a modular induction theorem. Our argument uses the philosophy of ABG as well as new ingredients. A secondary goal of this paper has been to put the original characteristic zero quantum result of ABG on firmer ground, and we provide arguments as needed to give a complete proof of that result also. Finally, using the modular result, we have been able in a separate preprint to introduce truncation functors, associated to finite weight posets, which effectively commute with the modular induction equivalence, assuming p>2h-2, with h the Coxeter number. This enables interpreting the equivalence at the level of derived categories of modules for suitable finite dimensional quasi-hereditary algebras. We expect similar results to hold in the the quantum setting.
