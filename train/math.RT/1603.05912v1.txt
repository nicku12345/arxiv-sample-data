There is a Rota-Baxter algebra structure on the field A=\mathbf{k}((t)) with  P being the projection map A=\mathbf{k}[[t]]\oplus t^{-1}\mathbf{k}[t^{-1}] onto  \mathbf{k}[[ t]]. We study the representation theory and regular-singular decompositions of any finite dimensional A-vector space. The main result shows that the category of finite dimensional representations is semisimple and consists of exactly three isomorphism classes of irreducible representations which are all one-dimensional. As a consequence, the number of GL_A(V)-orbits in the set of all regular-singular decompositions of an n-dimensional  A-vector space V is (n+2)(n+1)/2. We also use the result to compute the generalized class number, i.e., the number of the GL_n(A)-isomorphism classes of finitely generated \mathbf{k}[[t]]-submodules of A^n.
