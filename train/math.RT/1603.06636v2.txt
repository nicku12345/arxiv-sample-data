Given a decomposition of a vector space V=V_1\oplus V_2, the direct product \mathfrak{X} of the projective space \mathbb{P}(V_1) with a Grassmann variety \mathrm{Gr}_k(V) can be viewed as a double flag variety for the symmetric pair (G,K)=(\mathrm{GL}(V),\mathrm{GL}(V_1)\times\mathrm{GL}(V_2)). Relying on the conormal variety for the action of K on \mathfrak{X}, we show a geometric correspondence between the K-orbits of \mathfrak{X} and the K-orbits of some appropriate exotic nilpotent cone. We also give a combinatorial interpretation of this correspondence in some special cases. Our construction is inspired by a classical result of Steinberg and by the recent work of Henderson and Trapa for the symmetric pair (\mathrm{GL}(V),\mathrm{Sp}(V)).
