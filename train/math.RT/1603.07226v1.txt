Let p and \ell be two distinct primes, F a p-adic field and n an integer. We show that any level 0 block of the category of smooth Z \ell-valued representations of GL n (F) is equivalent to the unipotent block of an appropriate product of GL n i (F i). To this end, we first show that the level 0 category of GL n (F) is equivalent to a category of " modules " over a certain Z \ell-algebra " with many objects " whose definition only involves n and the residue field of F. Then we use fine properties of Deligne-Lusztig cohomology to split this algebra and produce suitable Morita equivalences.
