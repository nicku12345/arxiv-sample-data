In this paper, we shall give a way to construct a graded Lie algebra L(\mathfrak{g},\rho,V,{\cal V},B_0) from a standard pentad (\mathfrak{g},\rho,V,{\cal V},B_0) which consists of a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} which has a non-degenerate invariant bilinear form B_0 and \mathfrak{g}-modules (\rho, V) and {\cal V}\subset \mathrm {Hom }(V,\mathfrak{k}) all defined over a field \mathfrak{k}. In general, we do not assume that these objects are finite-dimensional. We can embed the objects \mathfrak{g},\rho,V,{\cal V} into L(\mathfrak{g},\rho,V,{\cal V},B_0). Moreover, we construct specific positively and negatively graded modules of L(\mathfrak{g},\rho,V,{\cal V},B_0). Finally, we give a chain rule on the embedding rules of standard pentads.
