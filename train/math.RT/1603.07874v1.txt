Let G be a reductive group over a local field F satisfying the assumptions of \cite{Deb1}, G_{reg}\subset G the subset of regular elements. Let T\subset G be a maximal torus. We write T_{reg}=T\cap G_{reg}. Let dg ,dt be Haar measures on G and T. They define an invariant measure dg/dt on G/T. Let \mathcal{H} be the space of complex valued locally constant functions on G with compact support. For any f\in \mathcal{H} ,t\in T_{reg} we define I_t(f)=\int_{G/T}f(\bar gt\bar g^{-1})dg/dt. Let P be the set of conjugacy classes of unipotent elements in G. For any \Omega \in P we fix an invariant measure \omega on \Omega. As well known \cite {R} for any f\in \mathcal{H} the integral I_\Omega (f)=\int_\Omega f\omega is absolutely convergent. Shalika \cite{Sh} has shown that there exist functions \tilde{j}_\Omega (t),\Omega \in P on T\cap G_{reg} such that I_t(f) = \sum_{\Omega \in P} \tilde{j}_\Omega(t) I_\Omega(f)\qquad\qquad (\star) for any f\in \mathcal{H} ,t\in T {\it near} to e where the notion of {\it near} depends on f. For any positive real number r one defines an open Ad-invariant subset G_r of G and a subspace \mathcal{H}_r as in \cite{Deb1}. In this paper I show that for any f\in \mathcal{H}_r the equality (\star) is true for all t\in T_{reg}\cap G_r.
