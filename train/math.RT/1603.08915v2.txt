In this paper, we relate the well-known Fock representations of the quantum toroidal algebra of sl(n) to the vertex, shuffle, and L-operator representations of the same algebra. These identifications generalize those for the quantum toroidal algebra of gl(1), which were recently established by Feigin-Jimbo-Miwa-Mukhin.
