Let \mathbf{k} be an algebraically closed field, and let \Lambda be a finite dimensional \mathbf{k}-algebra. We prove that if \Lambda is a Gorenstein algebra, then every finitely generated Cohen-Macaulay \Lambda-module V whose stable endomorphism ring is isomorphic to \mathbf{k} has a universal deformation ring R(\Lambda,V), which is a complete local commutative Noetherian \mathbf{k}-algebra with residue field \mathbf{k}, and which is also stable under taking syzygies. We investigate a particular non-self-injective Gorenstein algebra \Lambda_0, which is of infinite global dimension and which has exactly three isomorphism classes of finitely generated indecomposable Cohen-Macaulay \Lambda_0-modules V whose stable endomorphism ring is isomorphic to \mathbf{k}. We prove that in this situation, R(\Lambda_0,V) is isomorphic either to \mathbf{k} or to \mathbf{k}[[t]]/(t^2).
