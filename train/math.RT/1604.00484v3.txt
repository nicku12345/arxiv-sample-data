Motivated by \tau-tilting theory developed by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, for a finite-dimensional algebra \Lambda with action by a finite group G, we introduce the notion of G-stable support \tau-tilting modules. Then we establish bijections among G-stable support \tau-tilting modules over \Lambda, G-stable two-term silting complexes in the homotopy category of bounded complexes of finitely generated projective \Lambda-modules, and G-stable functorially finite torsion classes in the category of finitely generated left \Lambda-modules. In the case when \Lambda is the endomorphism of a G-stable cluster-tilting object T over a Hom-finite 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated category \mathcal{C} with a G-action, these are also in bijection with G-stable cluster-tilting objects in \mathcal{C}. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between stable support \tau-tilitng modules over \Lambda and the skew group algebra \Lambda G.
