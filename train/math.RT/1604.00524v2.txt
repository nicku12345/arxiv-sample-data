The Hom closed colocalising subcategories of the stable module category of a finite group scheme are classified. This complements the classification of the tensor closed localising subcategories in our previous work. Both classifications involve pi-points in the sense of Friedlander and Pevtsova. We identify for each pi-point an endofinite module which both generates the corresponding minimal localising subcategory and cogenerates the corresponding minimal colocalising subcategory.
