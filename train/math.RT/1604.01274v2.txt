Let \mathfrak{g} be a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra of rank \ell over an algebraically closed field \Bbbk of characteristic zero, and let (e,h,f) be an \mathfrak{sl}_2-triple of g. Denote by \mathfrak{g}^{e} the centralizer of e in \mathfrak{g} and by {\rm S}(\mathfrak{g}^{e})^{\mathfrak{g}^{e}} the algebra of symmetric invariants of \mathfrak{g}^{e}. We say that e is good if the nullvariety of some \ell homogenous elements of {\rm S}(\mathfrak{g}^{e})^{\mathfrak{g}^{e}} in (\mathfrak{g}^{e})^{*} has codimension \ell. If e is good then {\rm S}(\mathfrak{g}^{e})^{\mathfrak{g}^{e}} is a polynomial algebra. In this paper, we prove that the converse of the main result of arXiv:1309.6993 is true. Namely, we prove that e is good if and only if for some homogenous generating sequence q_1,\ldots,q_\ell, the initial homogenous components of their restrictions to e+\mathfrak{g}^{f} are algebraically independent over \Bbbk.
