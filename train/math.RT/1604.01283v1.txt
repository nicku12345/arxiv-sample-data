For a finite group scheme, the subadditive functions on finite dimensional representations are studied. It is shown that the projective variety of the cohomology ring can be recovered from the equivalence classes of subadditive functions. Using Crawley-Boevey's correspondence between subadditive functions and endofinite modules, we obtain an equivalence relation on the set of point modules introduced in our joint work with Iyengar and Pevtsova. This corresponds to the equivalence relation on pi-points introduced by Friedlander and Pevtsova.
