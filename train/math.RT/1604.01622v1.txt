Let \Gamma be a group acting on a scheme X and on a Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{g}. The corresponding equivariant map superalgebra M(\mathfrak{g}, X)^\Gamma is the Lie superalgebra of equivariant regular maps from X to \mathfrak{g}. In this paper we complete the classification of finite-dimensional irreducible M(\mathfrak{g}, X)^\Gamma-modules when \mathfrak{g} is a finite-dimensional simple Lie superalgebra, X is of finite type, and \Gamma is a finite abelian group acting freely on the rational points of X. We also describe extensions between these irreducible modules in terms of extensions between modules for certain finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras. As an application, when \Gamma is trivial and \mathfrak{g} is of type B(0,n), we describe the block decomposition of the category of finite-dimensional M(\mathfrak{g}, X)^\Gamma-modules in terms of spectral characters for \mathfrak{g}.
