We study the preprojective cohomological Hall algebra (CoHA) introduced by the authors in an earlier work for any quiver Q and any one-parameter formal group \mathbb{G}. In this paper, we construct a comultiplication on the CoHA, making it a bialgebra. We also construct the Drinfeld double of the CoHA. The Drinfeld double is a quantum affine algebra of the Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}_Q associated to Q, whose quantization comes from the formal group \mathbb{G}. We prove, when the group \mathbb{G} is the additive group, the Drinfeld double of the CoHA is isomorphic to the Yangian.
