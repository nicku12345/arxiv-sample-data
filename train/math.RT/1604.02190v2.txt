We briefly describe what tau-functions in integrable systems are. We then define a collection of tau-functions given as matrix elements for the action of \widehat{GL_2} on two-component Fermionic Fock space. These tau-functions are solutions to a discrete integrable system called a Q-system.   We can prove that our tau-functions satisfy Q-system relations by applying the famous "Desnanot-Jacobi identity" or by using "connection matrices", the latter of which gives rise to orthogonal polynomials. In this paper, we will provide the background information required for computing these tau-functions and obtaining the connection matrices and will then use the connection matrices to derive our difference relations and to find orthogonal polynomials.   We generalize the above by considering tau-functions that are matrix elements for the action of \widehat{GL_3} on three-component Fermionic Fock space, and discuss the new system of discrete equations that they satisfy. We will show how to use the connection matrices in this case to obtain "multiple orthogonal polynomials of type II".
