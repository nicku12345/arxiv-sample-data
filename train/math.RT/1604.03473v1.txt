Let k be a field. In this short note we give an example of a 2-abelian k-category, realized as a 2-cluster-tilting subcategory of the category \operatorname{mod}\,A of finite dimensional (right) A-modules over a finite dimensional k-algebra A, for which the naive idea for constructing its "bounded derived category" as 2-cluster-tilting subcategory of the bounded derived category of \operatorname{mod}\,A cannot work.
