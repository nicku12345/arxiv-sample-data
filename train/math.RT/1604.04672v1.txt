Let \mathfrak{g} be a complex finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra and \mathfrak{k} be any \mathrm{sl}(2)-subalgebra of \mathfrak{g}. In this paper we prove an earlier conjecture by Penkov and Zuckerman claiming that the first derived Zuckerman functor provides an equivalence between a truncation of a thick parabolic category \mathcal{O} for \mathfrak{g} and a truncation of the category of admissible (\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{k})-modules. This latter truncated category consists of admissible (\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{k})-modules with sufficiently large minimal \mathfrak{k}-type. We construct an explicit functor inverse to the Zuckerman functor in this setting. As a corollary we obtain an estimate for the global injective dimension of the inductive completion of the truncated category of admissible (\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{k})-modules.
