We have two parallel goals of this paper. First, we investigate and construct cofree coalgebras over n-representations of quivers, limits and colimits of n-representations of quivers, and limits and colimits of coalgebras in the monoidal categories of n-representations of quivers. Second, we introduce a generalization for quivers and show that this generalization can be seen as essentially the same as n-representations of quivers. This is significantly important because it allows us to build a new quiver \mathscr{Q}_{\!_{(\Qq_1, \Qq_2,..., \Qq_n)}}, called n-quiver, from any given quivers \Qq_1,\Qq_2,...,\Qq_n, and enable us to identify each category Rep_k(\Qq_j) of representations of a quiver \Qq_j as a full subcategory of the category Rep_k(\mathscr{Q}_{\!_{(\Qq_1, \Qq_2,..., \Qq_n)}}) of representations of \mathscr{Q}_{\!_{(\Qq_1, \Qq_2,..., \Qq_n)}} for every j \in \{1,\,\,2,\,\,..., \,\,n\}.
