Let F be a p-adic field. Let \mathcal{R} be the Grothendieck ring of complex smooth finite-length representations of the groups \{GL_n(F)\}_{n=0}^\infty taken together, with multiplication defined in the sense of parabolic induction. We introduce a width invariant for elements of \mathcal{R} and show that it gives an increasing filtration on the ring. Irreducible representations of width 1 are precisely those known as ladder representations. We thus obtain a necessary condition on irreducible factors of a product of two ladder representations. For such a product we further establish a multiplicity-one phenomenon, which was previously observed in special cases.
