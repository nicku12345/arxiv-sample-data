We show that certain paramodular cuspidal automorphic irreducible representations of \mathrm{GSp}(4,\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}), which are not CAP, are globally generic. This implies a multiplicity one theorem for paramodular cuspidal automorphic representations. Our proof relies on a reasonable hypothesis concerning the non-vanishing of central values of automorphic L-series.
