Let F be a non-archimedean local field of odd residue characteristic p. Let G be the unramified unitary group U(2, 1)(E/F) in three variables, and K be a maximal compact open subgroup of G. For an irreducible smooth representation \sigma of K over \overline{\mathbf{F}}_p, we prove that the compactly induced representation \text{ind}^G _K \sigma is free of infinite rank over the spherical Hecke algebra \mathcal{H}(K, \sigma).
