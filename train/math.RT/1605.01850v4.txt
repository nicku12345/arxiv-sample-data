Any three hypergeometric functions whose respective parameters a, b and c, differ by integers satisfy a linear relation with coefficients that are rational functions of a, b, c and the variable x. These relations are called three-term relations. This paper shows that the coefficients of three-term relations have properties called symmetries under certain changes of variables, and gives explicit formulas of these symmetries.
