According to the Auslander's formula one way of studying an abelian category {\mathcal{C}} is to study {\rm mod}\mbox{-}{\mathcal{C}}, that has nicer homological properties than {\mathcal{C}}, and then translate the results back to {\mathcal{C}}. Recently Krause gave a derived version of this formula and thus renewed the subject. This paper contains a detailed study of various versions of Auslander formula including the versions for all modules and for unbounded derived categories. We apply them to include some results concerning recollements of triangulated categories.
