The Zak transform on \mathbb{R}^d is an important tool in condensed matter physics, signal processing, time-frequency analysis, and harmonic analysis in general. This article introduces a generalization of the Zak transform to a class of locally compact G-spaces, where G is either a locally compact abelian or a second countable unimodular type I group. This framework unifies previously proposed generalizations of the Zak transform. It is shown that the Zak transform has invariance properties analog to the classic case and is a Hilbert space isomorphism between the space of L^2-functions and a direct integral of Hilbert spaces that is explicitly determined via a Weil formula for G-spaces and a Poisson summation formula for compact subgroups. Some applications in physics are outlined.
