In this paper, we study the isotropic Schur roots of an acyclic quiver Q with n vertices. We study the perpendicular category \mathcal{A}(d) of a dimension vector d and give a complete description of it when d is an isotropic Schur \delta. This is done by using exceptional sequences and by defining a subcategory \mathcal{R}(Q,\delta) attached to the pair (Q,\delta). The latter category is always equivalent to the category of representations of a connected acyclic quiver Q_{\mathcal{R}} of tame type, having a unique isotropic Schur root, say \delta_{\mathcal{R}}. The understanding of the simple objects in \mathcal{A}(\delta) allows us to get a finite set of generators for the ring of semi-invariants SI(Q,\delta) of Q of dimension vector \delta. The relations among these generators come from the representation theory of the category \mathcal{R}(Q,\delta) and from a beautiful description of the cone of dimension vectors of \mathcal{A}(\delta). Indeed, we show that SI(Q,\delta) is isomorphic to the ring of semi-invariants SI(Q_{\mathcal{R}},\delta_{\mathcal{R}}) to which we adjoin variables. In particular, using a result of Skowro\'nski and Weyman, the ring SI(Q,\delta) is a polynomial ring or a hypersurface. Finally, we provide an algorithm for finding all isotropic Schur roots of Q. This is done by an action of the braid group B_{n-1} on some exceptional sequences. This action admits finitely many orbits, each such orbit corresponding to an isotropic Schur root of a tame full subquiver of Q.
