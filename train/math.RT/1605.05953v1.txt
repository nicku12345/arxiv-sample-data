Let G be a finite group, and let B be a non-nilpotent block of G with respect to an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. Suppose that B has an elementary abelian defect group of order 16 and only one simple module. The main result of this paper describes the algebra structure of the center of B. This is motivated by a similar analysis of a certain 3-block of defect 2 in [Kessar, 2012].
