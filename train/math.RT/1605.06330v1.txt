Let G be a simple simply connected algebraic group over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p, with r-th Frobenius kernel G_r. Let M be a G_r-module and V a rational G-module. We put a variety structure on the set of all G_r-summands of V that are isomorphic to M, and study basic properties of these varieties. We give a few applications of this work to the representation theory of G, primarily in providing some sufficient conditions for when a G_r-module decomposition of V can be extended to a G-module decomposition. In particular we are interested in connections to Donkin's tilting module conjecture, and more generally to the problem of finding a G-structure for the projective indecomposable G_r-modules. To that end, we show that Donkin's conjecture is equivalent to determining the linearizability or non-linearizability of G-actions on certain affine spaces.
