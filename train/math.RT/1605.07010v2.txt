The purpose of the present paper is to investigate a hypergroup associated with irreducible characters of a compact hypergroup H and a closed subhypergroup H_0 of H with |H/H_0|< +\infty. The convolution of this hypergroup is introduced by inducing irreducible characters of H_0 to H and by restricting irreducible characters of H to H_0. The method of proof relies on the notion of an induced character and an admissible hypergroup pair.
