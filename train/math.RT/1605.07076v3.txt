Let F be a non--Archimedean local field of characteristic \geq 0, and let G=GL(N,F), N\geq 1. An element \gamma\in G is said to be quasi--regular if the centralizer of \gamma in M(N,F) is a product of field extensions of F. Let G_{\rm qr} be the set of quasi--regular elements of G. For \gamma\in G_{\rm qr}, we denote by \mathcal{O}_\gamma the ordinary orbital integral on G associated with \gamma. In this paper, we replace the Weyl discriminant \vert D_G\vert by a normalization factor \eta_G: G_{\rm qr}\rightarrow {\Bbb R}_{>0} which allows us to obtain the same results as proven by Harish--Chandra in characteristic zero: for f\in C^\infty_{\rm c}(G), the normalized orbital integral I^G(\gamma,f)=\eta_G^{1\over 2}(\gamma)\mathcal{O}_\gamma(f) is bounded on G, and for \epsilon>0 such that N(N-1)\epsilon <1, the function \eta_G^{-{1\over 2}-\epsilon} is locally integrable on G.
