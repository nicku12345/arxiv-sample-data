Let \pi be an irreducible, complex, smooth representation of GL_n over a local non-archimedean (skew) field. Assuming \pi has regular Zelevinsky parameters, we give a geometric necessary and sufficient criterion for the irreducibility of the parabolic induction of \pi\otimes\pi to GL_{2n}. The latter irreducibility property is the p-adic analogue of a special case of the notion of "real representations" introduced by Leclerc and studied recently by Kang-Kashiwara-Kim-Oh (in the context of KLR or quantum affine algebras). Our criterion is in terms of singularities of Schubert varieties of type A and admits a simple combinatorial description. It is also equivalent to a condition studied by Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer.
