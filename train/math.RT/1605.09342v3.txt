For a field \mathbb{F}, let L_k(\mathbb{F}) be the Lie algebra of derivations f(t)\frac{d}{dt} of the polynomial ring \mathbb{F}[t], where f(t) is a polynomial of degree \geqslant k. For any k\geqslant -1, we present a basis of the space of the cohomology with finite-dimensional support of the Lie algebra L_k(\mathbb{F}) with coefficients in the trivial module \mathbb{F} for the case where {\rm char}(\mathbb{F})=2. The main result obtained is an analog of the famous Goncharova's Theorem for the case {\rm char}(\mathbb{F})=0 and k\geqslant 1.
