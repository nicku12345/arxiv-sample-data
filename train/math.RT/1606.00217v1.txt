Let (T,\langle \cdot, \cdot, \cdot \rangle) be a Leibniz triple system of arbitrary dimension, over an arbitrary base field {\mathbb F}. A basis {\mathcal B} = \{e_{i}\}_{i \in I} of T is called multiplicative if for any i,j,k \in I we have that \langle e_i,e_j,e_k\rangle\in {\mathbb F}e_r for some r \in I. We show that if T admits a multiplicative basis then it decomposes as the orthogonal direct sum T= \bigoplus_k{\mathfrak I}_k of well-described ideals {\mathfrak I}_k admitting each one a multiplicative basis. Also the minimality of T is characterized in terms of the multiplicative basis and it is shown that, under a mild condition, the above direct sum is by means of the family of its minimal ideals.
