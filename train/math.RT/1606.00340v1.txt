For every n \geq 1, we present examples of algebras A having dominant dimension n, such that the algebra B=End_A(I_0 \oplus \Omega^{-n}(A)) has dominant dimension different from n, where I_0 is the injective hull of A. This gives a counterexample to conjecture 2 of Chen and Xi. While the conjecture is false in general, we show that a large class of algebras containing higher Auslander algebras satisfies the property in the conjecture.
