In this paper we state and prove a formula for the permutations associated to reddening and loop sequences in A_n straight orientation using the picture group. In particular this applies to maximal green sequences in A_n straight orientation. Furthermore we extend the definition and formula of the associated permutation to arbitrary mutation sequences based on our results. We introduce the concept of standard matrices which gives a canonical order on indecomposable components of cluster-tilting objects. Preservation of standardness of C-matrices by a combination of a mutation and its associated permutation gives the formula.
