Let K be a non-archimedean local field and let G = \mathrm{GL}_n(K). We have shown in previous work that the smooth dual \mathbf{Irr}(G) admits a complex structure: in this article we show how the epsilon factors interface with this complex structure. The epsilon factors, up to a constant term, factor as invariant characters through the corresponding complex tori. For the arithmetically unramified smooth dual of \mathrm{GL}_n, we provide explicit formulas for the invariant characters.
