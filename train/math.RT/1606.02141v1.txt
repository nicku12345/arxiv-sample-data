We characterize the Local Langlands Correspondence (LLC) for inner forms of GL_n via the Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence (JLC) and compatibility with the Langlands Classification. We show that LLC satisfies a natural compatibility with parabolic induction and characterize LLC for inner forms as a unique family of bijections \Pi(GL_r(D)) \to \Phi(GL_r(D)) for each r, (for a fixed D) satisfying certain properties. We construct a surjective map of Bernstein centers \mathfrak{Z}(GL_n(F))\to \mathfrak{Z}(GL_r(D)) and show this produces pairs of matching distributions. Finally, we construct explicit Iwahori-biinvariant matching functions for unit elements in the parahoric Hecke algebras of GL_r(D), and thereby produce many explicit pairs of matching functions.
