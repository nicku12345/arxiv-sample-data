In this note, using a representation theoretic method of Cogdell and Piatetski-Shapiro, we prove the Kuznetsov trace formula for an arbitrary discrete group \Gamma in \mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C}) that is cofinite but not cocompact. An essential ingredient is a kernel formula, recently proved by the author, on Bessel functions for \mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C}). This approach avoids the difficult analysis in the existing method due to Bruggeman and Motohashi.
