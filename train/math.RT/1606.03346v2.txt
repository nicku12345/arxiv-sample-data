In this article we construct Weil representations of quasi-split unitary groups U(n,n)(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}/\mathbb{F}_q) associated to quadratic extensions of finite fields. We define these representations by using an adequate presentation Bruhat like of those groups. More precisely, we define Weil representations of U(n,n)(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}/\mathbb{F}_q) associating to each generator a linear map of a suitable \mathbb{C}-vector space satisfying the relations of the aforementioned presentation. In addition, we also address the natural question on the compatibility of our representation of U(n,n)(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}/\mathbb{F}_q) with the classical one constructed by G\'erardin.
