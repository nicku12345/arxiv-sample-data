Singular Gelfand-Tsetlin modules of index 2 are modules whose tableaux bases may have singular pairs but no singular triples of entries on each row. In this paper we construct singular Gelfand-Tsetlin modules for arbitrary singular character of index 2. Explicit bases of derivative tableaux and the action of the generators of \mathfrak{gl}(n) are given for these modules. Our construction leads to new families of irreducible Gelfand-Tsetlin modules and also provides tableaux bases for some simple Verma modules.
