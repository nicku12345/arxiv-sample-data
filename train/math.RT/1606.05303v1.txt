A contragredient Lie superalgebra is a superalgebra defined by a Cartan matrix. In general, a contragredient Lie superalgebra is not finite dimensional, however it has a natural Z-grading by finite dimensional components. A contragredient Lie superalgebra has finite growth if the dimensions of these graded components depend polynomially on the degree. We discuss the classification of finite-growth contragredient Lie superalgebras. (Joint work with Vera Serganova)
