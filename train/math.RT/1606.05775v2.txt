We show that every integral block of category O for the general linear Lie superalgebra is equivalent to a corresponding block of category O for the queer Lie superalgebra. This implies the truth of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture for the so-called type A blocks of category O for the queer Lie superalgebra, as formulated by Cheng, Kwon and Wang.
