Surjective homological epimorphisms with stratifying kernel can be used to construct recollements of derived module categories. These `stratifying' recollements are derived from recollements of module categories. Can every recollement be put in this form, up to equivalence? A negative answer will be given after providing a characterisation of recollements equivalent to stratifying ones. Moreover, criteria for a ring epimorphism to be `stratifying' will be presented as well as constructions of such epimorphisms.
