We consider simple modules for a Hecke algebra with a parameter of quantum characteristic e. Equivalently, we consider simple modules D^{\lambda}, labelled by e-restricted partitions \lambda of n, for a cyclotomic KLR algebra R_n^{\Lambda_0} over a field of characteristic p\ge 0, with mild restrictions on p. If all parts of \lambda are at most 2, we identify a set \mathsf{DStd}_{e,p}(\lambda) of standard \lambda-tableaux, which is defined combinatorially and naturally labels a basis of D^{\lambda}. In particular, we prove that the q-character of D^{\lambda} can be described in terms of \mathsf{DStd}_{e,p}(\lambda). We show that a certain natural approach to constructing a basis of an arbitrary D^{\lambda} does not work in general, giving a counterexample to a conjecture of Mathas.
