This paper studies the "reduction mod p" method, which constructs large classes of representations for a semisimple algebraic group G from representations for the corresponding Lusztig quantum group U_\zeta at a p^r-th root of unity. The G-modules arising in this way include the Weyl modules, the induced modules, and various reduced versions of these modules. We present a relation between \operatorname{Ext}^n_G(V,W) and \operatorname{Ext}^n_{U_\zeta}(V',W'), when V,W are obtained from V',W' by reduction mod p. Since the dimensions of \operatorname{Ext}^n-spaces for U_\zeta-modules are known in many cases, our result guarantees the existence of many new extension classes and homomorphisms between certain rational G-modules. One application is a new proof of James Franklin's result on certain homomorphisms between two Weyl modules. We also provide some examples which show that the p-th root of unity case and a general p^r-th root of unity case are essentially different.
