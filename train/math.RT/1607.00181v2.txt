The irreducible unitary highest weight representations (\pi_\lambda,\mathcal{H}_\lambda) of the group U(\infty), which is the countable direct limit of the compact unitary groups U(n), are classified by the orbits of the weights \lambda \in \mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{N}} under the Weyl group S_{(\mathbb{N})} of finite permutations. Here, we determine those weights \lambda for which the first cohomology space H^1(U(\infty),\pi_\lambda,\mathcal{H}_\lambda) vanishes. For finitely supported \lambda \neq 0, we find that the first cohomology space H^1(U(\infty),\pi_\lambda,\mathcal{H}_\lambda) never vanishes. For these \lambda, the highest weight representations extend to norm-continuous irreducible representations of the full unitary group U(\mathcal{H}) (for \mathcal{H}:= \ell^2(\mathbb{N},\mathbb{C})) endowed with the strong operator topology and to norm-continuous representations of the unitary groups U_p(\mathcal{H}) (p\in [1,\infty]) consisting of those unitary operators g\in U(\mathcal{H}) for which g-\mathbb{1} is of pth Schatten class. However, not every 1-cocycle on U(\infty) automatically extends to one on these unitary groups, so we may not conclude that the first cohomology spaces of the extended representations are non-vanishing. On the contrary, for the groups U(\mathcal{H}) and U_\infty(\mathcal{H}), all first cohomology spaces vanish. This is different for the groups U_p(\mathcal{H}) with 1\leq p <\infty, where only the natural representation on \mathcal{H} and on its dual have vanishing first cohomology spaces.
