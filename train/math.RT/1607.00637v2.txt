We study the stable category of the factor algebra of the preprojective algebra associated with an element w of the Coxeter group of a quiver. We show that there exists a silting object M(\bf{w}) of this category associated with each reduced expression \bf{w} of w and give a sufficient condition on \bf{w} such that M(\bf{w}) is a tilting object. In particular, the stable category is triangle equivalent to the derived category of the endomorphism algebra of M(\bf{w}). Moreover, we compare it with a triangle equivalence given by Amiot-Reiten-Todorov for a cluster category.
