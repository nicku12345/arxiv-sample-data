Comparing the module categories of an algebra and of the endomorphism algebra of a given support \tau-tilting module, we give a generalization of the Brenner-Butler's tilting theorem in the framework of \tau-tilting theory. Afterwards we define \tau-slices and prove that complete slices of tilted algebras and local slices of cluster tilted algebras are examples of complete \tau-slices. Then we apply this concept to the study of simply connected tilted algebras. Finally, we study the one-point extensions and the split-by-nilpotent extensions of an algebra with \tau-slices.
