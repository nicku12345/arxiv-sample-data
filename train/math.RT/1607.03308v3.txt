Let G be a simply connected semisimple algebraic group with Lie algebra \mathfrak g, let G_0 \subset G be the symmetric subgroup defined by an algebraic involution \sigma and let \mathfrak g_1 \subset \mathfrak g be the isotropy representation of G_0. Given an abelian subalgebra \mathfrak a of \mathfrak g contained in \mathfrak g_1 and stable under the action of some Borel subgroup B_0 \subset G_0, we classify the B_0-orbits in \mathfrak a and we characterize the sphericity of G_0 \mathfrak a. Our main tool is the combinatorics of \sigma-minuscule elements in the affine Weyl group of \mathfrak g and that of strongly orthogonal roots in Hermitian symmetric spaces.
