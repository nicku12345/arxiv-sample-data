The irreducible integrable representations with finite-dimensional weight spaces of toroidal Lie algebras on which the center acts non-trivially were classified by S.Eswara Rao. In this paper we give a compact proof of the results that lead to the classification theorem. Further we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which two such irreducible modules are isomorphic.
