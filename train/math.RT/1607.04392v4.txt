In this paper we study the subcategory of finite-length objects of the category of positive level integrable representations of a toroidal Lie algebra. The main goal is to characterize the blocks of the category. In the cases when the underlying finite type Lie algebra associated with the toroidal Lie algebra is simply-laced, we are able to give a parametrization for the blocks.
