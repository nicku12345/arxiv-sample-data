We introduce the N\'eron-Severi Lie algebra of a Soergel module and we determine it for a large class of Schubert varieties. This is achieved by investigating which Soergel modules admit a tensor decomposition. We also use the N\'eron-Severi Lie algebra to provide an easy proof of the well-known fact that a Schubert variety is rationally smooth if and only if its Betti numbers satisfy Poincar\'e duality.
