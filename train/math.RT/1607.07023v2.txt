We prove the validity of the freeness conjecture of Brou\'e, Malle and Rouquier for the generic Hecke algebras associated to the exceptional complex reflection groups of rank 2 belonging to the tetrahedral and octahedral families, and we give a description of the basis similar to the classical case of the finite Coxeter groups.
