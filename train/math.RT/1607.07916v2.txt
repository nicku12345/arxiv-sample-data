In this paper we construct representations of certain graded double affine Hecke algebras (DAHA) with possibly unequal parameters from geometry. More precisely, starting with a simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} together with a \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}-grading \oplus_{i}\mathfrak{g}_{i} and a block of G_{\underline{0}}-equivariant complexes on the nilpotent cone of \mathfrak{g}_{\underline{1}} as introduced in \cite{LY1}, we attach a graded DAHA and construct its action on the direct sum of spiral inductions in that block. This generalizes results of Vasserot \cite{V} and Oblomkov-Yun \cite{OY} which correspond to the case of the principal block.
