Building on ideas of Tupan, we give an elementary proof of a result of M{\oe}glin, Vign\'{e}ras and Waldspurger on the existence of automorphisms of many p-adic classical groups that take each irreducible smooth representations to its dual. Our proof also applies to the corresponding similitude groups.
