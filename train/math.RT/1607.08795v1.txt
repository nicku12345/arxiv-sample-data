We consider p-blocks with abelian defect groups and in the first part prove a relationship between its Loewy length and that for blocks of normal subgroups of index p. Using this, we show that if B is a 2-block of a finite group with abelian defect group D \cong C_{2^{a_1}} \times \cdots \times C_{2^{a_r}} \times (C_2)^s, where a_i > 1 for all i and r \geq 0, then d < LL(B) \leq 2^{a_1}+\cdots+2^{a_r}+2s-r+1, where |D|=2^d. When s=1 the upper bound can be improved to 2^{a_1}+\cdots+2^{a_r}+2-r. Together these give sharp upper bounds for every isomorphism type of D. A consequence is that when D is an abelian 2-group the Loewy length is bounded above by |D| except when D is a Klein-four group and B is Morita equivalent to the principal block of A_5. We conjecture similar bounds for arbitrary primes and give evidence that it holds for principal 3-blocks.
