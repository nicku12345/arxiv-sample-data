In 1996, Doty, Nakano and Peters defined infinitesimal Schur algebras, combining the approach via polynomial representations with the approach via G_r T-modules to representations of the algebraic group G = \mathrm{GL}_n. We study analogues of these algebras and their Auslander-Reiten theory for reductive algebraic groups G and Borel subgroups B by considering the categories of polynomial representations of G_r T and B_r T as full subcategories of \mathrm{mod} \thinspace G_r T and \mathrm{mod}\thinspace B_r T, respectively. We show that every component \Theta of the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver \Gamma_s(G_r T) of \mathrm{mod}\thinspace G_r T whose constituents have complexity 1 contains only finitely many polynomial modules. For G = \mathrm{GL}_2, r = 1 and T \subseteq G the torus of diagonal matrices, we identify the polynomial part of the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of G_r T and use this to determine the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the infinitesimal Schur algebras in this situation. For the Borel subgroup B of lower triangular matrices of \mathrm{GL}_2, the category of B_r T-modules is related to representations of elementary abelian groups of rank r. In this case, we can extend our results about modules of complexity 1 to modules of higher Frobenius kernels arising as outer tensor products.
