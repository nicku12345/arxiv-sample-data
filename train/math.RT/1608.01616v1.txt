We study the module categories of a tilted algebra C and the corresponding cluster-tilted algebra B. We investigate how various properties of a C-module are affected when considered in the module category of B. We give a complete classification of the projective dimension of a C-module inside the module category of B. If a C-module M is rigid, we show two sufficient conditions for M to be a rigid B-module. In particular, if M is an indecomposable and rigid C-module, we prove M is always a rigid B-module.
