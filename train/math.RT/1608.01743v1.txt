We calculate the rational cohomology of the commuting variety X_{G, n} consisting of n-tuples of commuting elements of a compact reductive group G. This is done by studying a map from a related variety Y_{G, n}, which has easily calculated cohomology. The proof studies the fibers of the map and uses the Vietoris-Begle theorem to prove that the induced map on rational cohomology is an isomorphism.
