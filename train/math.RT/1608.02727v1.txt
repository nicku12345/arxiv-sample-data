For finite groups G with non-abelian, trivial intersection Sylow p-subgroups, the analysis of the Loewy structure of the centre of a block allows us to deduce that a stable equivalence of Morita type does not induce an algebra isomorphism between the centre of the principal block of G and the centre of the Brauer correspondent. This was already known for the Suzuki groups; the result will be generalised to cover more groups with trivial intersection Sylow p-subgroups.
