In this paper, we extend the iterative expression for the generalized spherical functions associated to the root systems of type A previously obtained beyond regular elements. We also provide the corresponding expression in the flat case. From there, we derive a Laplace-type representation for the generalized spherical functions associated to the root systems of type A in the Dunkl setting as well as in the trigonometric Dunkl setting. This representation leads us to describe precisely the support of the generalized Abel transform. Thanks to a recent result of Rejeb, this allows us to give the support for the Dunkl intertwining operator.
