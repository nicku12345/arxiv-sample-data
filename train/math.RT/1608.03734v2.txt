We give a complete classification of (co)torsion pairs in finite 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories with maximal rigid objects which are not cluster tilting. These finite 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories are divided into two main classes: one denoted by \mathcal{A}_{n,t} called of type A, and the other denoted by D_{n,t} called of type D. By using the geometric model of cluster categories of type A,  or type D, we give a geometric description of (co)torsion pairs in \mathcal{A}_{n,t} or D_{n,t} respectively, via defining the periodic Ptolemy diagrams. This allows to count the number of (co)torsion pairs in these categories. Finally, we determine the hearts of (co)torsion pairs in all finite 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories with maximal rigid objects which are not cluster tilting via quivers and relations.
