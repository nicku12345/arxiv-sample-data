Following the method developed by Waldspurger and Beuzart-Plessis in their proofs of the local Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture, we are able to prove the geometric side of a local relative trace formula for the Ginzburg-Rallis model. Then by applying such formula, we prove a multiplicity formula of the Ginzburg-Rallis model for the supercuspidal representations. Using that multiplicity formula, we prove the multiplicity one theorem for the Ginzburg-Rallis model over Vogan packets in the supercuspidal case.
