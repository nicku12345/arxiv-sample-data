Inspired by the work [PA], we establish an explicit algebra isomorphism between the degenerate cyclotomic Yokonuma-Hecke algebra Y_{r,n}^{d}(q) and a direct sum of matrix algebras over tensor products of degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type A. We then develop several applications of this result, including a new proof of the modular representation theory of Y_{r,n}^{d}(q), a semisimplicity criterion for it and cellularity of it. Moreover, we prove that Y_{r,n}^{d}(q) is a symmetric algebra and determine the associated Schur elements by using the isomorphism theorem for it.
