This article relates dominant and codominant dimensions of modules to Gorenstein homological properties. We call a module Gorenstein projective-injective in case it is Gorenstein projective and Gorenstein injective. For gendo-symmetric algebras we find a characterisation of Gorenstein projective-injective modules in terms of dominant and codominant dimensions and find representation theoretic and homological properties of the category of Gorenstein projective-injective modules. In particular, we give a new construction of non-selfinjective algebras having Auslander-Reiten components consisting only of Gorenstein projective modules. We introduce the class of nearly Gorenstein algebras, where the Gorenstein projective-injective modules have especially nice properties in case the algebra is gendo-symmetric. We also show that the Nakayama conjecture holds for nearly Gorenstein algebras.
