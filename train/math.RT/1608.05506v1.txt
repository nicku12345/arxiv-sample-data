Let F(n) be a connected and simply connected free 2-step nilpotent lie group and K be a compact subgroup of Aut(F(n)). We say that (K,F(n)) is a Gelfand pair when the set of integrable K-invariant functions on F(n) forms an abelian algebra under convolution. In this paper, we consider the case when K=O(n). In [1], we know the only possible Galfand pairs for (K,F(n)) is (O(n),F(n)), (SO(n),F(n)). So we just consider the case (O(n),F(n)), the other case can be obtained in the similar way.We study the natural topology on \Delta (O(n),F(n)) given by uniform convergence on compact subsets in F(n). We show \Delta (O(n),F(n)) is a complete metric space. Our main result gives a necessary and sufficient result for the sequence of the "type 1" bounded O(n)-spherical functions uniform convergence to the "type 1" bounded O(n)-spherical function on compact sets in F(n). What's more, the "type 1" bounded O(n)-spherical functions are dense in \Delta (O(n),F(n)). Further, we define the Fourier transform according to the "type 2" bounded O(n)-spherical functions and gives some basic properties of it.
