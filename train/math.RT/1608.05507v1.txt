We show that the Eigenspace Representations for \mathbb{R}^{n} semidirect with a finite pseudo-reflection group K, which satisfy some generic property are equivalent to the induced representations from \mathbb{R}^{n} to \mathbb{R}^{n} \rtimes K, which satisfy the same property by Mackey little group method.And the proof of the equivalence is by using matrix coefficients and invariant theory.As a consequence, these eigenspace representations are irreducible.
