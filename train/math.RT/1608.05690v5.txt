Let \Lambda be a finite-dimensional algebra over a fixed algebraically closed field \mathbf{k} of arbitrary characteristic, and let V be a finitely generated \Lambda-module. It follows from results previously obtained by F.M. Bleher and the third author that V has a well-defined versal deformation ring R(\Lambda, V), which is a complete local commutative Noetherian \mathbf{k}-algebra with residue field \mathbf{k}. The third author also proved that if \Lambda is a Gorenstein \mathbf{k}-algebra and V is a Cohen-Macaulay \Lambda-module whose stable endomorphism ring is isomorphic to \mathbf{k}, then R(\Lambda, V) is universal. In this article we prove that the isomorphism class of a versal deformation ring is preserved under singular equivalence of Morita type between Gorenstein \mathbf{k}-algebras.
