Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p\geqslant 0 and let Y=\mbox{Spin}_{2n+1}(K) (n\geqslant 3) be a simply connected simple algebraic group of type B_n over K. Also let X be the subgroup of type D_n, embedded in Y in the usual way, as the derived subgroup of the stabilizer of a non-singular one-dimensional subspace of the natural module for Y. In this paper, we give a complete set of isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional, irreducible, rational KY-modules on which X acts with exactly two composition factors.
