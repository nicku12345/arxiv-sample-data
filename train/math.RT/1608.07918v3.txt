Let \Lambda be a finite dimensional algebra of type {\mathbb A}_n over an algebraically closed field K with the quiver Q and let |\Det(\Lambda)| be the number of the minimal right determiners of all irreducible morphisms between indecomposable left \Lambda-modules. If \Lambda is a path algebra, then we have |\Det(\Lambda)|= 2n-2, &\mbox{if p=0; } 2n-p-1, &\mbox{if p\geq 1,} where p=|\{i\mid i is a source in Q with 2\leq i\leq n-1\}|. If \Lambda is a bound quiver algebra, then we have  |\Det(\Lambda)|= 2n-2, &\mbox{if r=1; } 2n-p-q-1, &\mbox{if r\geq 2,}  where q is the number of non-zero sink ideals of \Lambda and r=|\{i\mid i is a sink in Q with 1\leq i\leq n\}|.
