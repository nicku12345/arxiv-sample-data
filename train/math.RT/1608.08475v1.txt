Following a scheme inspired by B. Feigon, we describe the spectral side of a local relative trace formula for G:= PGL(2,\rm E) relative to the symmetric subgroup H:=PGL(2,\rm F) where \rm E/\rm F is an unramified quadratic extension of local non archimedean fields of characteristic 0. This spectral side is given in terms of regularized normalized periods and normalized C-functions of Harish-Chandra. Using the geometric side obtained in a more general setting by P. Delorme, P. Harinck and S. Souaifi , we deduce a local relative trace formula for G relative to H. We apply our result to invert some orbital integrals.
