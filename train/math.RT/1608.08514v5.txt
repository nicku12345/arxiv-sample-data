We consider algebras defined over a complete, local and noetherian ground ring. They are gentle algebras in case the ground ring is a field. The unbounded homotopy category of complexes of projective modules is considered. Complexes with finitely-generated homogeneous components are shown to be isomorphic to direct sums of indecomposable string and band complexes. The corresponding isoclasses are described, and the Krull-Remak-Schmidt-Azumaya property is verified. This classification problem is solved using the idea of functorial filtrations.
