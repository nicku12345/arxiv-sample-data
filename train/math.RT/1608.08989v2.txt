Let G=GL(m|n) be the general linear supergroup over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero and let G_{ev}=GL(m)\times GL(n) be its even subsupergroup. The induced supermodule H^0_G(\lambda), corresponding to a dominant weight \lambda of G, can be represented as H^0_{G_{ev}}(\lambda)\otimes \Lambda(Y), where Y=V_m^*\otimes V_n is a tensor product of the dual of the natural GL(m)-module V_m and the natural GL(n)-module V_n, and \Lambda(Y) is the exterior algebra of Y. For a dominant weight \lambda of G, we construct explicit G_{ev}-primitive vectors in H^0_G(\lambda). Related to this, we give explicit formulas for G_{ev}-primitive vectors of the supermodules H^0_{G_{ev}}(\lambda)\otimes \otimes^k Y. Finally, we describe a basis of G_{ev}-primitive vectors in the largest polynomial subsupermodule \nabla(\lambda) of H^0_G(\lambda) (and therefore in the costandard supermodule of the corresponding Schur superalgebra S(m|n)). This yields a description of a basis of G_{ev}-primitive vectors in arbitrary induced supermodule H^0_G(\lambda).
