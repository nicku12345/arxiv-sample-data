Let G be a complex reductive group and H=G^{\theta} be its fixed point subgroup under a Galois involution \theta. We show that any H-distinguished representation \pi (i.e \mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{C}}\left(\pi^{*}\right)^{H}\neq0) satisfies:   1) \pi^{\theta}\simeq\tilde{\pi}, where \tilde{\pi} is the contragredient representation and \pi^{\theta} is the twist of \pi under \theta.   2) \mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{C}}\left(\pi^{*}\right)^{H}\leq\left|B\backslash G/H\right|, where B is a Borel subgroup of G.   By proving Statement 1), we give a partial answer to a conjecture by Lapid.
