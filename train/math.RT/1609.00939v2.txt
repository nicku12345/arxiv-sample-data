Let Z be the symmetric cone of r \times r positive definite Hermitian matrices over a real division algebra \mathbb F. Then Z admits a natural family of invariant differential operators -- the Capelli operators C_\lambda -- indexed by partitions \lambda of length at most r, whose eigenvalues are given by specialization of Knop--Sahi interpolation polynomials.   In this paper we consider a double fibration Y \longleftarrow X \longrightarrow Z where Y is the Grassmanian of r-dimensional subspaces of \mathbb F^n  with n \geq 2r. Using this we construct a family of invariant differential operators D_{\lambda,s} on Y that we refer to as quadratic Capelli operators. Our main result shows that the eigenvalues of the D_{\lambda,s} are given by specializations of Okounkov interpolation polynomials.
