In this note, we show that the space associated with sub-Hankel determinant is a non-reductive, regular prehomogeneous vector space, and we give the multiplicative Legendre transforms of sub-Hankel determinants. Moreover we observe certain relations between b-functions of polarization of PVpolynomials and b-functions of sub-Hankel determinants, and give some formulas about sub-Hankel determinants whose components are orthogonal ponlynomials.
