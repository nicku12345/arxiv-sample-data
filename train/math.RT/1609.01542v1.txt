The standard theory of endoscopy for real groups has two parallel formulations. The original formulation of Langlands and Shelstad relies on methods in harmonic analysis. The subsequent formulation of Adams, Barbasch and Vogan relies on sheaf-theoretic methods. The original formulation was extended by Kottwitz and Shelstad to twisted endoscopy. We extend the sheaf-theoretic formulation to the context of twisted endoscopy and provide applications for computing Arthur packets.
