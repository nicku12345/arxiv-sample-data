Using the Zhelobenko's approach we investigate a branching of an irreducible representation of g_n under the restriction of algebras g_n\downarrow g_{n-1}, where g_n is a Lie algebra of type B_n, C_n, D_n or a Lie algebra of type A, where in this case we put g_{n}=\mathfrak{gl}_{n+1}, g_{n-1}=\mathfrak{gl}_{n-1}. We give a new explicit description of the space of the g_{n-1}-highest vectors, then we construct a base in this space. The case n=2 is considered separately for different algebras, but a passage from n=2 to an arbitrary n is the same for all series A, B, C, D. This new procedure has the following advantage: it establishes a relation between spaces of g_{n-1}-highest vectors for different series of algebras. This procedure describes an extension of Gelfand-Tsetlin tableaux to the left.
