Let G=GL(m|n) be a general linear supergroup and G_{ev} be its even subsupergroup isomorphic to GL(m)\times GL(n). In this paper we use the explicit description of G_{ev}-primitive vectors in the costandard supermodule \nabla(\lambda), the largest polynomial G-subsupermodule of the induced supermodule H^0_G(\lambda), for (m|n)-hook partition \lambda, and a properties of certain morphisms \psi_k to derive results related to the odd linkage for G over a field F of characteristic different from 2.
