For every cluster-tilted algebra of simply-laced Dynkin type we provide a companion basis which is strong, i.e. gives the set of dimension vectors of the finitely generated indecomposable modules for the cluster-tilted algebra. This shows in particular that every companion basis of a cluster-tilted algebra of simply-laced Dynkin type is strong. Thus we give a proof of Parsons's conjecture.
