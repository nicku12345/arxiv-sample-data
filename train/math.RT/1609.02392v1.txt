Let G be the finite simple Chevalley group of type ^2E_6(2). It has a Schur multiplier of type C_2^2 \times C_3. We determine the ordinary character tables of the central extensions 3.G, 6.G, (2^2\times 3).G of G and their extensions by an automorphism of order 2, that is 3.G.2, 6.G.2 and (2^2\times 3).G.2.   Furthermore we determine all Brauer trees of all groups of type Z.G.A (where Z is central in Z.G \lhd Z.G.A and A \cong Z.G.A/Z.G) for which the ordinary character table is known.
