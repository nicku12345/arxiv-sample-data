We present a general diagrammatic approach to the construction of efficient algorithms for computing a Fourier transform on a semisimple algebra. This extends previous work wherein we derive best estimates for the computation of a Fourier transform for a large class of finite groups. We continue to find efficiencies by exploiting a connection between Bratteli diagrams and the derived path algebra and construction of Gel'fand-Tsetlin bases. Particular results include highly efficient algorithms for the Brauer, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras.
