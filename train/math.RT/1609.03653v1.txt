For any Kac-Moody group \mathbf{G}, we prove that the Bruhat order on the semidirect product of the Weyl group and the Tits cone for \mathbf{G} is strictly compatible with a \mathbb{Z}-valued length function. We conjecture in general and prove for \mathbf{G} of affine ADE type that the Bruhat order is graded by this length function. We also formulate and discuss conjectures relating the length function to intersections of "double-affine Schubert varieties."
