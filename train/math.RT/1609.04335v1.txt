Let \mathcal{G} be a finite group scheme over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic {\rm char}(k)=p\geq 3. In generalization of the familiar notion from the modular representation theory of finite groups, we define the p-rank \mathsf{rk}_p(\mathcal{G}) of \mathcal{G} and determine the structure of those group schemes of p-rank 1, whose linearly reductive radical is trivial. The most difficult case concerns infinitesimal groups of height 1, which correspond to restricted Lie algebras. Our results show that group schemes of p-rank \leq 1 are closely related to those being of finite or domestic representation type.
