Let \rm E/\rm F be an unramified quadratic extension of local non archimedean fields of characteristic 0. Let \underline{H} be an algebraic reductive group, defined and split over \rm F. We assume that the split connected component of the center of \underline{H} is trivial. Let (\tau,V) be a \underline{H}(\rm F)-distinguished supercuspidal representation of \underline{H}(\rm E). Using the recent results of C. Zhang, and the geometric side of a local relative trace formula obtained by P. Delorme, P. Harinck and S. Souaifi, we describe spherical characters associated to \underline{H}(\rm F)-invariant linear forms on V in terms of weighted orbital integrals of matrix coefficients of \tau.
