Let G be a reductive group scheme of type A acting on a spherical scheme X. We prove that there exists a number C such that the multiplicity \dim Hom(\rho,\mathbb{C}[X(F)]) is bounded by C, for any finite field F and any irreducible representation \rho of G(F). We give an explicit bound for C.   We conjecture that this result is true for any reductive group scheme and when F ranges (in addition) over all local fields of characteristic 0.
