We introduce a notion of generalized Auslander-Reiten duality on a Hom-finite Krull-Schmidt exact category \mathcal{C}. This duality induces the generalized Auslander-Reiten translation functors \tau and \tau^-. They are mutually quasi-inverse equivalences between the stable categories of two full subcategories \mathcal{C}_r and \mathcal{C}_l of \mathcal{C}. A non-projective indecomposable object lies in the domain of \tau if and only if it appears as the third term of an almost split conflation; dually, a non-injective indecomposable object lies in the domain of \tau^- if and only if it appears as the first term of an almost split conflation.
