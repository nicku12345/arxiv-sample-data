This paper provides a construction of the unipotent representations for classical complex groups in terms of the Theta correspondence as introduced and studied by R. Howe. The K-type structure of unipotent representations is obtained as a consequence of the character formulas for unipotent representations of D. Vogan and the author. This provides a tight link between unipotent representations and the orbit philosophy. A parametrization of unipotent representations for the Spin groups is obtained.
