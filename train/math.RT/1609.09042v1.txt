For a partition \beta, denote by N_\beta the nilpotent linear operator of Jordan type \beta. Given partitions \beta, \gamma, we investigate the representation space {}_2{\mathbb V}_{\gamma}^\beta of all short exact sequences  \mathcal E: 0\to N_\alpha \to N_\beta \to N_\gamma \to 0 where \alpha is any partition with each part at most 2. Due to the condition on \alpha, the isomorphism type of a sequence \mathcal E is given by an arc diagram \Delta; denote by {\mathbb V}_\Delta the subset of {}_2{\mathbb V}_{\gamma}^\beta of all sequences isomorphic to \mathcal E.   Thus, the space {}_2{\mathbb V}_{\gamma}^\beta carries a stratification given by the subsets of type {\mathbb V}_\Delta. We compute the dimension of each stratum and show that the boundary of a stratum {\mathbb V}_\Delta consists exactly of those {\mathbb V}_{\Delta'} where \Delta' is obtained from \Delta by a non-empty sequence of arc moves of five possible types {\bf (A) -- (E)}.   The case where all three partitions are fixed has been studied in [3] and [4]. There, arc moves of types {\bf (A) -- (D)} suffice to describe the boundary of a {\mathbb V}_\Delta in {\mathbb V}_{\alpha,\gamma}^\beta. Our fifth move {\bf (E)}, "explosion", is needed to break up an arc into two poles to allow for changes in the partition \alpha.
