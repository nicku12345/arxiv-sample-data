Inspired by the work [Ra1], we directly give a complete classification of irreducible calibrated representations of affine Yokonuma-Hecke algebras \widehat{Y}_{r,n}(q) over \mathbb{C}, which are indexed by r-tuples of placed skew shapes. We then develop several applications of this result. In the appendix, inspired by [Ru], we classify and construct irreducible completely splittable representations of degenerate affine Yokonuma-Hecke algebras D_{r,n} and the wreath product (\mathbb{Z}/r\mathbb{Z})\wr \mathfrak{S}_{n} over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p> 0 such that p does not divide r.
