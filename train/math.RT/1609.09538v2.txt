Let L_w be the Levi part of the stabilizer Q_w in GL_N (for left multiplication) of a Schubert variety X(w) in the Grassmannian G_{d,N}. For the natural action of L_w on \mathbb{C}[X(w)], the homogeneous coordinate ring of X(w) (for the Pl\"ucker embedding), we give a combinatorial description of the decomposition of \mathbb{C}[X(w)] into irreducible L_w-modules; in fact, our description holds more generally for the action of the Levi part L of any parabolic subgroup Q that is contained in Q_w. This decomposition is then used to show that all smooth Schubert varieties, all determinantal Schubert varieties, and all Schubert varieties in G_{2,N} are spherical L_w-varieties.
