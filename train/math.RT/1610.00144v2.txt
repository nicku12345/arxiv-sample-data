Let Q be a finite quiver without sources, and A be the corresponding algebra with radical square zero. We construct an explicit compact generator for the homotopy category of acyclic complexes of projective A-modules. We call such a generator the projective Leavitt complex of Q. This terminology is justified by the following result: the opposite differential graded endomorphism algebra of the projective Leavitt complex of Q is quasi-isomorphic to the Leavitt path algebra of Q^{ op}. Here, Q^{op} is the opposite quiver of Q and the Leavitt path algebra of Q^{op} is naturally Z-graded and viewed as a differential graded algebra with trivial differential.
