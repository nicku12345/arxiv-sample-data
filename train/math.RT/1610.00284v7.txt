Let F be either \mathbb{R} or a finite extension of \mathbb{Q}_p, and let G be a finite central extension of the group of F-points of a reductive group defined over F. Also let \pi be a smooth representation of G (Frechet of moderate growth if F=\mathbb{R}). For each nilpotent orbit \mathcal{O} we consider a certain Whittaker quotient \pi_{\mathcal{O}} of \pi. We define the Whittaker support WS(\pi) to be the set of maximal \mathcal{O} among those for which \pi_{\mathcal{O}}\neq 0.   In this paper we prove that all \mathcal{O}\in\mathrm{WS}(\pi) are quasi-admissible nilpotent orbits, generalizing some of the results in [Moe96,JLS16]. If F is p-adic and \pi is quasi-cuspidal then we show that all \mathcal{O}\in\mathrm{WS}(\pi) are F-distinguished, i.e. do not intersect the Lie algebra of any proper Levi subgroup of G defined over F.   We also give an adaptation of our argument to automorphic representations, generalizing some results from [GRS03,Shen16,JLS16,Cai] and confirming some conjectures from [Ginz06].   Our methods are a synergy of the methods of the above-mentioned papers, and of our preceding paper [GGS17].
