A frieze in the modern sense is a map from the set of objects of a triangulated category \mathsf{C} to some ring. A frieze X is characterised by the property that if \tau x\rightarrow y\rightarrow x is an Auslander-Reiten triangle in \mathsf{C}, then X(\tau x)X(x)-X(y)=1. The canonical example of a frieze is the (original) Caldero-Chapoton map, which send objects of cluster categories to elements of cluster algebras. \par In \cite{friezes1} and \cite{friezes2}, the notion of generalised friezes is introduced. A generalised frieze X' has the more general property that X'(\tau x)X'(x)-X'(y)\in\{0,1\}. The canonical example of a generalised frieze is the modified Caldero-Chapoton map, also introduced in \cite{friezes1} and \cite{friezes2}. \par Here, we develop and add to the results in \cite{friezes2}. We define Condition F for two maps \alpha and \beta in the modified Calero-Chapoton map, and in the case when \mathsf{C} is 2-Calabi-Yau, we show that it is sufficient to replace a more technical "frieze-like" condition from \cite{friezes2}. We also prove a multiplication formula for the modified Caldero-Chapoton map, which significantly simplifies its computation in practice.
