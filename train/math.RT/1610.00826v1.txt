Let F(n) be a connected and simply connected free 2-step nilpotent lie group and K be a compact subgroup of Aut(F(n)). We say that (K,F(n)) is a Gelfand pair when the set of integrable K-invariant functions on F(n) forms an abelian algebra under convolution. In this paper, we consider the case when K=O(n). In this case, the Gelfand space (O(n),F(n) is equipped with the Godement-Plancherel measure, and the spherical transform \land:L_{O(n)}^{2}(F(n))\rightarrow L^{2}(\Delta (O(n),F(n))) is an isometry. I will prove the Gelfand space \Delta (O(n),F(n)) is equipped with the Godement-Plancherel measure and the inversion formula. Both of which have something related to its correspond Heisenberg group. The main result in this paper provides a complete characterization of the set \varphi_{O(n)} (F(n))^{\wedge}=\{\widehat{f}\mid f\in \varphi_{O(n)} (F(n))\} of spherical transforms of O(n)-invariant Schwartz functions on F(n). I show that a function F on \Delta (O(n),F(n)) belongs to \varphi_{O(n)} (F(n))^{\wedge} if and only if the functions obtained from F via application of certain derivatives and difference operators satisfy decay conditions.
