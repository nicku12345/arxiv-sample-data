The Green ring of the half quantum group H=U_n(q) is computed in [Chen, Van Oystaeyen, Zhang]. The tensor product formulas between indecomposables may be used for a generalized subgroup depth computation in the setting of quantum groups -- to compute depth of the Hopf subalgebra H in its Drinfeld double D(H). In this paper the Hopf subalgebra quotient module Q (a generalization of the permutation module of cosets for a group extension) is computed and, as H-modules, Q and its second tensor power are decomposed into a direct sum of indecomposables. We note that the least power n, referred to as depth, for which Q^{\otimes (n)} has the same indecomposable constituents as Q^{\otimes (n+1)} is n = 2, since  Q^{\otimes (2)} contains all H-module indecomposables, which determines the minimum even depth d_{ev}(H,D(H)) = 6.
