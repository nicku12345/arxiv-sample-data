Inspired by recent work of Carlson, Friedlander and Pevtsova concerning modules for p-elementary abelian groups E_r of rank r over a field of characteristic p > 0, we introduce the notions of modules with constant d-radical rank and modules with constant d-socle rank for the generalized Kronecker algebra \mathcal{K}_r = k\Gamma_r with r \geq 2 arrows and 1 \leq d \leq r-1. We study subcategories given by modules with the equal d-radical property and the equal d-socle property. Utilizing the Simplification method due to Ringel, we prove that these subcategories in \mathrm{mod} \ \mathcal{K}_r are of wild type. Then we use a natural functor \mathfrak{F} \colon \mathrm{mod} \ \mathcal{K}_r \to \mathrm{mod} \ kE_r to transfer our results to \mathrm{mod} \ kE_r.
