For two distinguished prime \ell and p, we prove a \ell-adic version of the Poisson formula for reductive p-adic groups. In order to do this we write an identity for the trace of regular representation and orbital integrals. Next we reduce them to orbital integrals for endoscopy groups and look at this as the special value of L-function at s=0. And finally show that it is equal to the special value of motivic L-function at s=0.
