We consider the group SL_2(K), where K is a local non-archimedean field of characteristic two. We prove that the depth of any irreducible representation of SL_2 (K) is larger than the depth of the corresponding Langlands parameter, with equality if and only if the L-parameter is essentially tame.   We also work out a classification of all L-packets for SL_2 (K) and for its non-split inner form, and we provide explicit formulae for the depths of their L-parameters.
