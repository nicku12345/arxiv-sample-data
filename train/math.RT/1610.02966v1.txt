We give new properties of algebras with finite Gorenstein dimension coinciding with the dominant dimension \geq 2, which are called Auslander-Gorenstein algebras in the recent work of Iyama and Solberg, see \cite{IyaSol}. In particular, when those algebras are standardly stratified, we give criteria when the category of (properly) (co)standardly filtered modules has a nice homological description using tools from the theory of dominant dimensions and Gorenstein homological algebra. We give some examples of standardly stratified algebras having dominant dimension equal to the Gorenstein dimension, including examples having an arbitrary natural number as Gorenstein dimension and blocks of finite representation-type of Schur algebras.
