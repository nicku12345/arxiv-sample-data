A conjecture by Mackey and Higson claims that there is close relationship between irreducible representations of a real reductive group and those of its Cartan motion group. The case of irreducible tempered unitary representations has been verified recently by Afgoustidis. We study the admissible representations of SL(2,\mathbb{R}) by considering families of \D-modules over its flag varieties. We make a conjecture which gives a geometric understanding of the Makcey-Higson bijection in the general case.
