Let G be a quasi-split tamely ramified connected reductive group defined over a p-adic field F. We show that if -1 is in the F-points of the absolute Weyl group of G, then self-dual supercuspidal representations of G(F) exist. Now assume further that G is unramified and that the center of G is connected. Let \pi be a generic self-dual depth-zero regular supercuspidal representation of G(F). We show that the Frobenius-Schur indicator of \pi is given by the sign by which a certain distinguished element of the center of G(F) of order two acts on \pi.
