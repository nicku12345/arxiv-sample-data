Bihom-Lie algebra is a generalized Hom-Lie algebra endowed with two commuting multiplicative linear maps. In this paper, we study cohomology and representations of Bihom-Lie algebras. In particular, derivations, central extensions, derivation extensions, the trivial representation and the adjoint representation of Bihom-Lie algebras are studied in detail.
