We first present an Iwahori-Matsumoto presentation of affine Yokonuma-Hecke algebras \widehat{Y}_{r,n}(q) to give a new proof of the fact, which was previously proved by Chlouveraki and S\'echerre, that \widehat{Y}_{r,n}(q) is a particular case of the pro-p-Iwahori-Hecke algebras defined by Vign\'eras, meanwhile, we give one application. Using the new presentation, we then give a third presentation of \widehat{Y}_{r,n}(q), from which we immediately get an unexpected result, that is, the extended affine Hecke algebra of type A is a subalgebra of the affine Yokonuma-Hecke algebra.
