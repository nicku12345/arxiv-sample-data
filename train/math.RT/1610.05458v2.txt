This article consists of an introduction to Iyama's higher Auslander-Reiten theory for Artin algebras from the viewpoint of higher homological algebra. We provide alternative proofs of the basic results in higher Auslander-Reiten theory, including the existence of d-almost-split sequences in d-cluster-tilting subcategories, following the approach to classical Auslander-Reiten theory due to Auslander, Reiten, and Smal{\o}. We show that Krause's proof of Auslander's defect formula can be adapted to give a new proof of the defect formula for d-exact sequences. We use the defect formula to establish the existence of morphisms determined by objects in d-cluster-tilting subcategories.
