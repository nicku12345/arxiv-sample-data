Let X be a prehomogeneous vector space under a connected reductive group G over \mathbb{R}. Assume that the open G-orbit X^+ admits a finite covering by a symmetric space. We study certain zeta integrals involving (i) Schwartz functions on X, and (ii) generalized matrix coefficients on X^+(\mathbb{R}) of Casselman-Wallach representations of G(\mathbb{R}), upon a twist by complex powers of relative invariants. This merges representation theory with prehomogeneous zeta integrals of Igusa et al. We show their convergence in some shifted cone, and prove their meromorphic continuation via the machinery of b-function together with V. Ginzburg's results on admissible D-modules. This provides some evidences for a broader theory of zeta integrals associated to affine spherical embeddings.
