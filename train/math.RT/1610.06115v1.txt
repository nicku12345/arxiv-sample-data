Let \La be an elementary locally bounded linear category over a field with radical squared zero. We shall show that the bounded derived category D^b(\ModbLa) of finitely supported left \La-modules admits a Galois covering which is the bounded derived category of almost finitely co-presented representations of a gradable quiver. Restricting to the bounded derived category D^b({\rm mod}^b\hspace{-2pt}\La) of finite dimensional left \La-modules, we shall be able to describe its indecomposable objects, obtain a complete description of the shapes of its Auslander-Reiten components, and classify those \La such that D^b({\rm mod}^b\hspace{-2.3pt}\La) has only finitely many Auslander-Reiten components.
