Let F be a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic 0 and G=Sp(4,F). Let (\pi,W) be an irreducible smooth self-dual representation G. The space W of \pi admits a non-degenerate G-invariant bilinear form (\,,\,) which is unique up to scaling. The form (\,,\,) is easily seen to be symmetric or skew-symmetric and we set \varepsilon({\pi})=\pm 1 accordingly. In this paper, we show that \varepsilon{(\pi)}=1 when \pi is an Iwahori spherical representation of G.
