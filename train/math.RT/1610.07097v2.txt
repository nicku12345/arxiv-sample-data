Some minimal representations of SL(n,R) can be realized on a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions. This is the analogue of the Brylinski-Kostant model. They can also be realized on a Hilbert space of homogeneous functions on {\bboard R}^n. This is the analogue of the Kobayashi-Orsted model. We will describe the two realizations and a transformation which maps one model to the other. It can be seen as an analogue of the classical Bargmann transform.
