These are lecture notes from a mini-course given at the CIMPA in Mar del Plata, Argentina, in March 2016. The aim of the course was to introduce cluster characters for 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories and present their main properties. The notes start with the theory of F-polynomials of modules over finite-dimensional algebras. Cluster categories are then introduced, before the more general setting of 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories with cluster-tilting objects is defined. Finally, cluster characters are presented, and their use in the categorification of cluster algebras is outlined.
