We formulate Nazarov-Wenzl type algebras {\widehat{P}_d^-} for the representation theory of the Periplectic Lie superalgebras \mathfrak{p}(n). We establish a Arakawa-Suzuki type theorem to provide a connection between \mathfrak{p}(n)-representations and \widehat{P}_d^--representations. We also consider various tensor product representations for \widehat{P}_d^-. The periplectic Brauer algebra A_d defined by Moon is an quotient of \widehat{P}_d^-. In particular, actions induced by Jucys-Murphy elements can be obtained under the tensor product representation of \widehat{P}_d^-. Also, a Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt type basis for \widehat{P}_d^- is obtained.
