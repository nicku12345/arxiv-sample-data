Inspired by the Capelli identities for group determinants obtained by T\^oru Umeda, we give a basis of the center of the group algebra of any finite group by using Capelli identities for irreducible representations.   The Capelli identities for irreducible representations are modifications of the Capelli identity. These identities lead to Capelli elements of the group algebra. These elements construct a basis of the center of the group algebra.
