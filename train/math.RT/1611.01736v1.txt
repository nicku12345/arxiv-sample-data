Block type Lie algebras have been studied by many authors in the latest twenty years. In this paper, we will study a class of more general Block type Lie algebra \mathcal{B}(p,q), which is a class of infinite-dimensional Lie algebra by using the generalized Balinskii-Novikov's construction method to Witt type Novikov algebra. We study the representation theory for \mathcal{B}(p,q). We classify quasifinite irreducible highest weight \mathcal{B}(p,q)-module. We also prove that any quasifinite irreducible module of Block type Lie algebras \mathcal{B}(p,q) is either a highest or lowest weight module, or else a uniformly bounded module. This paper can be considered as a generalization of the related literatures.
