We study weight modules of the Lie algebra W_2 of vector fields on {\mathbb C}^2. A classification of all simple weight modules of W_2 with a uniformly bounded set of weight multiplicities is provided. To achieve this classification we introduce a new family of generalized tensor W_n-modules. Our classification result is an important step in the classification of all simple weight W_n-modules with finite weight multiplicities.
