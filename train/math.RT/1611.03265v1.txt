We give two different approaches to classifying the simple modules of 0-Yokonuma-Hecke algebras Y_{r,n}(0) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p such that p does not divide r. Using the isomorphism between the 0-Yokonuma-Hecke algebra and 0-Ariki-Koike-Shoji algebra, we in fact give another way to obtain the simple modules of the latter, which was previously studied by Hivert, Novelli and Thibon (Adv. Math. \bf{205} (2006) 504-548). In the appendix, we give the classification of simple modules of the nil Yokonuma-Hecke algebra.
