We use the relations between the base change representations, theta lifts and Whittaker model, to give a new proof to the period problems of GL(2) over a quadratic local field extension E/F. And we classify both local and global D^\times(F)-distinguished representations \pi^D of D^\times(E), where D^\times is an inner form of GL_2 defined over a nonarchimedean field or a number field F.
