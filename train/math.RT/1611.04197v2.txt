A duality theorem for the stable module category of representations of a finite group scheme is proved. One of its consequences is an analogue of Serre duality, and the existence of Auslander-Reiten triangles for the \mathfrak{p}-local and \mathfrak{p}-torsion subcategories of the stable category, for each homogeneous prime ideal \mathfrak{p} in the cohomology ring of the group scheme.
