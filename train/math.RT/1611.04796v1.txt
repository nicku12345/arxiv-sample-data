Let \mathfrak{o} be the ring of integers in a non-Archimedean local field with finite residue field, \mathfrak{p} its maximal ideal, and r\geq2 an integer. An irreducible representation of the finite group G_{r}=\mathrm{GL}_{N}(\mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}^{r}) is called regular if its restriction to the principal congruence kernel K^{r-1}=1+\mathfrak{p}^{r-1}\mathrm{M}_{N}(\mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}^{r}) consists of representations whose stabilisers modulo K^{1} are centralisers of regular elements in \mathrm{M}_{N}(\mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}).   The regular representations form the largest class of representations of G_{r} which is currently amenable to explicit construction. Their study, motivated by constructions of supercuspidal representations, goes back to Shintani, but the general case remained open for a long time. In this paper we give an explicit construction of all the regular representations of G_{r}.
