In this paper, we study some relation between the cocenter \bar H(G) of the Hecke algebra H(G) of a connected reductive group G over an nonarchimedean local field and the cocenter \bar H(M) of its Levi subgroups M.   Given any Newton component of \bar H(G), we construct the induction map \bar i from the corresponding Newton component of \bar H(M) to it. We show that this map is surjective. This leads to the Bernstein-Lusztig type presentation of the cocenter \bar H(G), which generalizes the work \cite{HN2} on the affine Hecke algebras. We also show that the map \bar i we constructed is adjoint to the Jacquet functor and in characteristic 0, the map \bar i is an isomorphism.
