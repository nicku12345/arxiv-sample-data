We aim to construct an element satisfying Hemmer's combinatorial criterion for H^1(\mathfrak{S}_n, S^\lambda) to be non-vanishing. In the process, we discover an unexpected and surprising link between the combinatorial theory of integral designs and the representation theory of the symmetric groups.
