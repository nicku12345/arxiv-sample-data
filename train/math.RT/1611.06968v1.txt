We find the blocks for the symplectic blob algebra for all specialisations of the parameters over the complex numbers. We determine Gram determinants for the cell modules. We also show that the algebra is semisimple over the complex numbers unless at least one of the quantisation parameters, or the sum or difference of two of the parameters is integral or q is a root of unity. We also find decomposition numbers in many of the q generic cases.
