In the representation theory of simple Lie algebras, we consider the problem of constructing a monomial basis in an arbitrary irreducible finite-dimensional highest weight module. We construct a PBW-type basis in every finite-dimensional representation of B_n and D_n and we describe the associated semigroup of essential signatures. These bases are parameterized by integer points in some polytopes. We give the inequalities defining these polytopes.
