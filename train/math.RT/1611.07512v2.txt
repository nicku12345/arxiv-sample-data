Let p be a prime number, and let Dist(SL_2) be the algebra of distributions, supported at 1, on the algebraic group SL_2 over \mathbb{F}_p. The Frobenius map Fr:SL_2\to SL_2 induces a map Fr:Dist(SL_2)\to Dist(SL_2) which is in particular a surjective algebra homomorphism. In this note, we construct a section of this map, whenever p\geq 3. The main ingredient of this construction is a certain congruence modulo p^3, reminiscent of the congruence \binom{np}{p}\equiv n\mod p^3.
