Let G be the adjoint group of a real simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}_0 equal either \mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{u}(n,1) or \mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{o}(n,1), K its maximal compact subgroup, {\cal U}(\mathfrak{g}) the universal enveloping algebra of the complexification \mathfrak{g} of \mathfrak{g}_0 and {\cal U}(\mathfrak{g})^K its subalgebra of K-invariant elements. By a result of F. Knopp [3] {\cal U}(\mathfrak{g}) is free as a {\cal U}(\mathfrak{g})^K-module, so there exists a K-submodule E of {\cal U}(\mathfrak{g}) such that the multiplication defines an isomorphism of K-modules {\cal U}(\mathfrak{g})^K\otimes E\longrightarrow{\cal U}(\mathfrak{g}). We prove that E is equivalent to the regular representation of K, i.e. that the multiplicity of every \delta\in\hat{K} in E equals its dimension. As a consequence we get that for any finitedimensional complex K-module V the space ({\cal U}(\mathfrak{g})\otimes V)^K of K-invariants is free {\cal U}(\mathfrak{g})^K-module of rank \dim\,V.
