We propose a new effective method of constructing explicitly Gelfand -Tsetlin modules for \mathfrak{gl}_n. We obtain a large family of simple modules that have a basis consisting of Gelfand-Tsetlin tableaux, the action of the Lie algebra is given by the Gelfand-Tsetlin formulas and with all Gelfand-Tsetlin multiplicities equal 1. As an application of our construction we prove necessary and sufficient condition for the Gelfand and Graev's continuation construction to define a module which was conjectured by Lemire and Patera.
