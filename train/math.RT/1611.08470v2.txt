We study the representation theory of quantizations of Gieseker moduli spaces. We describe the categories of finite dimensional representations for all parameters and categories O for special values of parameters. We find the values of parameters, where the quantizations have finite homological dimension, and establish abelian localization theorem. We describe the two-sided ideals. Finally, we determine annihilators of the irreducible objects in categories O for some special choices of one-parameter subgroups.
