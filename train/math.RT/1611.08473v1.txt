We use the theory of skew duality to show that decomposing the tensor product of k irreducible representations of the symplectic group Sp_{2m} = Sp_{2m}(C) is equivalent to branching from Sp_{2n} to Sp_{2n_1}\times\cdots\times Sp_{2n_k} where n, n_1,\ldots, n_k are positive integers such that n = n_1+\cdots+n_k and the n_j's depend on m as well as the representations in the tensor product. Using this result and a work of J. Lepowsky, we obtain a skew Pieri rule for Sp_{2m}, i.e., a description of the irreducible decomposition of the tensor product of an irreducible representation of the symplectic group Sp_{2m} with a fundamental representation.
