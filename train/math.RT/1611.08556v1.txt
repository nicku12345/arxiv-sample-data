We show that if B is a block of a finite group algebra kG over an algebraically closed field k of prime characteristic p such that \HH^1(B) is a simple Lie algebra and such that B has a unique isomorphism class of simple modules, then B is nilpotent with an elementary abelian defect group P of order at least 3, and \HH^1(B) is in that case isomorphic to the Jacobson-Witt algebra \HH^1(kP). In particular, no other simple modular Lie algebras arise as \HH^1(B) of a block B with a single isomorphism class of simple modules.
