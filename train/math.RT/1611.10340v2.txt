We introduce hierarchies of difference equations (referred to as nT-systems) associated to the action of a (centrally extended, completed) infinite matrix group GL_{\infty}^{(n)} on n-component fermionic Fock space. The solutions are given by matrix elements (\tau-functions) for this action. We show that the \tau-functions of type nT satisfy bilinear equations of length 3,4,\dots,n+1. The 2T-system is, after a change of variables, the usual 3 term T-system of type A.   Restriction from GL_{\infty}^{(n)} to a subgroup isomorphic to the loop group LGL_{n}, defines nQ-systems, studied earlier by the present authors for n=2,3.
