Let \mathfrak g=\mathfrak g_{\bar 0}\oplus\mathfrak g_{\bar 1} be the queer Lie superalgebra and let L be a finite-dimensional non-trivial irreducible \mathfrak g-module. Restricting the \mathfrak g-action on L to \mathfrak g_{\bar 0}, we show that the space of \mathfrak g_{\bar 0}-invariants L^{\mathfrak g_{\bar 0}} is trivial. As a consequence we establish a conjecture first formulated by Gorelik, Grantcharov and Mazorchuk on the triviality of the supercharacter of irreducible \mathfrak g-modules in the case when the modules are finite dimensional.
