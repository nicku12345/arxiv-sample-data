A family ({\mathbf D}_\lambda)_{\lambda\in \mathbb C} of differential operators on the sphere S^n is constructed. The operators are conformally covariant for the action of the subgroup of conformal transformations of S^n which preserve the smaller sphere S^{n-1}\subset S^n. The family of conformally covariant differential operators from S^n to S^{n-1} introduced by A. Juhl is obtained by composing these operators on S^n and taking restrictions to S^{n-1}.
