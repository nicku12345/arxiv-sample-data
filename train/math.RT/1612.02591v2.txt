Given an exact category \mathcal{C}, we denote by \mathcal{C}_l the smallest additive subcategory containing injectives and indecomposable objects which appear as the first term of an almost split conflation. We prove that a deflation is right determined by some object if and only if its intrinsic kernel lies in \mathcal{C}_l. We give characterizations for \mathcal{C} having Auslander-Reiten duality.
