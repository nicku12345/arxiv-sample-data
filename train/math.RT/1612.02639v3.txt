We continue the study of glider representations of finite groups G with given structure chain of subgroups e \subset G_1 \subset \ldots \subset G_d = G. We give a characterization of irreducible gliders of essential length e \leq d which in the case of p-groups allows to prove some results about classical representation theory. The paper also contains an introduction to generalized character theory for glider representations and an extension of the decomposition groups in the Clifford theory. Furthermore, we study irreducible glider representations for finite nilpotent groups.
