Let \mathfrak{g} be a simple complex Lie algebra and let \mathfrak{t} \subset \mathfrak{g} be a toral subalgebra of \mathfrak{g}. As a \mathfrak{t}-module \mathfrak{g} decomposes as \[\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{s} \oplus \big(\oplus_{\nu \in \mathcal{R}} \mathfrak{g}^\nu\big)\] where \mathfrak{s} \subset \mathfrak{g} is the reductive part of a parabolic subalgebra of \mathfrak{g} and \mathcal{R} is the Kostant root system associated to \mathfrak{t}. When \mathfrak{t} is a Cartan subalgebra of \mathfrak{g} the decomposition above is nothing but the root decomposition of \mathfrak{g} with respect to \mathfrak{t}; in general the properties of \mathcal{R} resemble the properties of usual root systems. In this note we study the following problem: "Given a subset \mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{R}, is there a parabolic subalgebra \mathfrak{p} of \mathfrak{g} containing \mathcal{M} = \oplus_{\nu \in \mathcal{S}} \mathfrak{g}^\nu and whose reductive part equals \mathfrak{s}?". Our main results is that, for a classical simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} and a saturated \mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{R}, the condition (\operatorname{Sym}^\cdot(\mathcal{M}))^{\mathfrak{s}} = \mathbf{C} is necessary and sufficient for the existence of such a \mathfrak{p}. In contrast, we show that this statement is no longer true for the exceptional Lie algebras \mathrm{F}_4, \mathrm{E}_6, \mathrm{E}_7, and \mathrm{E}_8. Finally, we discuss the problem in the case when \mathcal{S} is not saturated.
