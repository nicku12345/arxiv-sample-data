In the study of symmetry classes of tensors, finding examples of symmetry classes of tensors that possess an o*-basis is of considerable interest. There are only few classes of groups that have been provided a necessary and sufficient condition for having such a basis. There is no general criterion for any finite groups yet. In this note, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of o*-basis of symmetry classes of tensors associated with semi-direct product of some finite abelian groups and, consequently, their wreath product.
