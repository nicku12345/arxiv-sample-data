The authors proved that a Weyl module for a simple algebraic group is irreducible over every field if and only if the module is isomorphic to the adjoint representation for E_{8} or its highest weight is minuscule. In this paper, we prove an analogous criteria for irreducibility of Weyl modules over the quantum group U_{\zeta}({\mathfrak g}) where {\mathfrak g} is a complex simple Lie algebra and \zeta ranges over roots of unity.
