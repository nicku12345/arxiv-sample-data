In this paper we construct an "abstract Fock space" for general Lie types that serves as a generalisation of the infinite wedge q-Fock space familiar in type A. Specifically, for each positive integer \ell, we define a \mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]-module \mathcal{F}_{\ell} with bar involution by specifying generators and "straightening relations" adapted from those appearing in the Kashiwara-Miwa-Stern formulation of the q-Fock space. By relating \mathcal{F}_{\ell} to the corresponding affine Hecke algebra we show that the abstract Fock space has standard and canonical bases for which the transition matrix produces parabolic affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. This property and the convenient combinatorial labeling of bases of \mathcal{F}_{\ell} by dominant integral weights makes \mathcal{F}_{\ell} a useful combinatorial tool for determining decomposition numbers of Weyl modules for quantum groups at roots of unity.
