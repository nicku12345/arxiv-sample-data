Assume G is a finite symplectic group \mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(q) over a finite field \mathbb{F}_q of odd characteristic. We describe the action of the automorphism group \mathrm{Aut}(G) on the set \mathrm{Irr}(G) of ordinary irreducible characters of G. This description relies on the equivariance of Deligne--Lusztig induction with respect to automorphisms. We state a version of this equivariance which gives a precise way to compute the automorphism on the corresponding Levi subgroup; this may be of independent interest. As an application we prove that the global condition in Sp\"ath's criterion for the inductive McKay condition holds for the irreducible characters of \mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(q).
