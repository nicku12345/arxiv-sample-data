We first give a short intrinsic, diagrammatic proof of the First Fundamental Theorem of invariant theory (FFT) for the special orthogonal group \text{SO}_m(\mathbb{C}), given the FFT for \text{O}_m(\mathbb{C}). We then define, by means of a presentation with generators and relations, an enhanced Brauer category \widetilde{\mathcal{B}}(m) by adding a single generator to the usual Brauer category \mathcal{B}(m), together with four relations. We prove that our category \widetilde{\mathcal{B}}(m) is actually (and remarkably) {\em equivalent} to the category of representations of \text{SO}_m generated by the natural representation. The FFT for \text{SO}_m amounts to the surjectivity of a certain functor \mathcal{F} on \text{Hom} spaces, while the Second Fundamental Theorem for \text{SO}_m says simply that \mathcal{F} is injective on \text{Hom} spaces. This theorem provides a diagrammatic means of computing the dimensions of spaces of homomorphisms between tensor modules for \text{SO}_m (for any m). These methods will be applied to the case of the orthosymplectic Lie algebras \text{osp}(m|2n), where the super-Pfaffian enters, in a future work.
