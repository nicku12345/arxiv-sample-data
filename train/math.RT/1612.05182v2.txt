For each positive integer n, we introduce a monoidal category \mathcal{JP}(n) using a generalization of partition diagrams. When the characteristic of the ground field is either 0 or at least n, we show \mathcal{JP}(n) is monoidally equivalent to the full subcategory of \operatorname{Rep}(A_n) whose objects are tensor powers of the natural n-dimensional permutation representation of the alternating group A_n.
