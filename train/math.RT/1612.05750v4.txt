Koszul duality and covering theory are combined to realise the bounded derived category D of an algebra with radical square zero as a certain orbit category of the bounded derived category of finitely presented representations of an associated infinite quiver. As a consequence, the possible shapes of the connected components of the Auslander--Reiten quiver of D are described.
