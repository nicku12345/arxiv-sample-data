We show that the Duflo-Serganova functor on the category of finite-dimensional modules over a finite-dimensional contragredient Lie superalgebra induces a ring homomorphism on a natural quotient of the Grothendieck ring, which is isomorphic to the ring of characters. We realize this homomorphism as a certain evaluation of functions related to the supersymmetry property. We use this realization to describe the kernel and image of the homomorphism induced by the Duflo-Serganova functor.
