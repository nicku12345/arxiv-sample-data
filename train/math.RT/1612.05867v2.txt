For any given symmetrizable Cartan matrix C with a symmetrizer D, Gei\ss~ et al. (2016) introduced a generalized preprojective algebra \Pi(C, D). We study tilting modules and support \tau-tilting modules for the generalized preprojective algebra \Pi(C, D) and show that there is a bijection between the set of all cofinite tilting ideals of \Pi(C,D) and the corresponding Weyl group W(C) provided that C has no component of Dynkin type. When C is of Dynkin type, we also establish a bijection between the set of all basic support \tau-tilting \Pi(C,D)-modules and the corresponding Weyl group W(C). These results generalize the classification results of Buan et al. (Compos. Math. 145(4), 1035-1079, 2009) and Mizuno (Math. Zeit. 277(3), 665-690, 2014) over classical preprojective algebras.
