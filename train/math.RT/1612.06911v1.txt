We explore the connection between the notion of Hopf category and the categorification of the infinite dimensional Heisenberg algebra via graphical calculus proposed by M.Khovanov. We show that the existence of a Hopf structure on a semisimple symmetric monoidal abelian category implies existence of a categorical action in the sense of Khovanov and thus leads to a strong categorification of this algebra.
