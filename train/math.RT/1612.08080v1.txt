This paper contains the decomposition matrices for blocks of defect at most 2 in Category \mathcal{O}_c(W) of the rational Cherednik algebra when W=E_8 or F_4 with equal parameters c=1/d, d>2 a regular number of W. A corollary of the result is a classification of the dimensions of support of the irreducible modules L(\tau) in \mathcal{O}_{1/d}(W) except in the following cases: W=E_8, d=4 or 6 and L(\tau) is in the principal block, or d=2 or 3; W=F_4, d=2. In particular, this classifies the finite-dimensional modules of H_c(E_8) when d\neq 2,3,4,6.
