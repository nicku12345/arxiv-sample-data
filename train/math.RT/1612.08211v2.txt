For a complex reflection group W with reflection representation \mathfrak{h}, we define and study a natural filtration by Serre subcategories of the category \mathcal{O}_c(W, \mathfrak{h}) of representations of the rational Cherednik algebra H_c(W, \mathfrak{h}). This filtration refines the filtration by supports and is analogous to the Harish-Chandra series appearing in the representation theory of finite groups of Lie type. Using the monodromy of the Bezrukavnikov-Etingof parabolic restriction functors, we show that the subquotients of this filtration are equivalent to categories of finite-dimensional representations over generalized Hecke algebras. When W is a finite Coxeter group, we give a method for producing explicit presentations of these generalized Hecke algebras in terms of finite-type Iwahori-Hecke algebras. This yields a method for counting the number of irreducible objects in \mathcal{O}_c(W, \mathfrak{h}) of given support. We apply these techniques to count the number of irreducible representations in \mathcal{O}_c(W, \mathfrak{h}) of given support for all exceptional Coxeter groups W and all parameters c, including the unequal parameter case. This completes the classification of the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of \mathcal{O}_c(W, \mathfrak{h}) for exceptional Coxeter groups W in many new cases.
