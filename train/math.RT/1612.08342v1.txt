Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field k. Let T be a tilting A-module and B={\rm End}_A\ T be the endomorphism algebra of T. In this paper, we consider the correspondence between the tilting A-modules and the tilting B-modules, and we prove that there is a one-one correspondence between the basic T-tilting A-modules in T^{\perp} and the basic tilting B-modules in ^{\perp}(D_BT). Moreover, we show that there is a one-one correspondence between the T-contravariantly finite T-resolving subcategories of T^{\perp} and the basic T-tilting A-modules contained in T^{\perp}. As an application, we show that there is a one-one correspondence between the basic tilting A-modules in T^{\perp} and the basic tilting B-modules in ^{\perp}(D_BT) if A is a 1-Gorenstein algebra or a m-replicated algebra over a finite dimensional hereditary algebra.
