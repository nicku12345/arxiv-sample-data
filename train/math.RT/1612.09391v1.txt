For the algebra L= K <x, d/dx, \int> of polynomial integro-differential operators over a field K of characteristic zero, a classification of indecomposable, generalized weight L-modules of finite length is given. Each such module is an infinite dimensional uniserial module. Ext-groups are found between indecomposable generalized weight modules, it is proven that they are finite dimensional vector spaces.
