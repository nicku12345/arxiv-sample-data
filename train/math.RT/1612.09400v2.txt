We consider inhomogeneous supersymmetric bilinear forms, i.e., forms that are neither even nor odd. We classify such forms up to dimension seven in the case when the restrictions of the form to the even and odd parts of the superspace are nondegenerate. As an application, we introduce a new type of oscillator Lie superalgebra.
