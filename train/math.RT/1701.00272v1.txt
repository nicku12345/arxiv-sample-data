Navarro has conjectured a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite group G to have a self-normalising Sylow 2-subgroup, which is given in terms of the ordinary irreducible characters of G. The first-named author has reduced the proof of this conjecture to showing that certain related statements hold when G is quasisimple. In this article we show that these conditions are satisfied when G/Z(G) is \mathrm{PSL}_n(q), \mathrm{PSU}_n(q), or a simple group of Lie type defined over a finite field of characteristic 2.
