We study the space of invariant generalized functions supported on an orbit of the action of a real algebraic group on a real algebraic manifold. This space is equipped with the Bruhat filtration. We study the generating function of the dimensions of the filtras, and give some methods to compute it. To illustrate our methods we compute those generating functions for the adjoint action of \mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{C}). Our main tool is the notion of generalized functions on a real algebraic stack, introduced recently by Sakellaridis.
