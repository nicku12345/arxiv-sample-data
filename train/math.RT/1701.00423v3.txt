We introduce a class of categories, called \emph{clustered hyperbolic categories}, which are generated by equivalent categories of representations of some Weyl cluster algebras. Every preseed p gives rise to a \emph{categorical preseed} \mathcal{P} which generates a clustered hyperbolic category through \emph{categorical mutations}. A "categorification" of Weyl cluster algebra is introduced in the sense of defining a map \mathbf{F}_{p} from the clustered hyperbolic category \mathfrak{C}(\mathcal{P}) to the Weyl cluster algebra \mathcal{H}(p) where image of \mathbf{F}_{p} generates \mathcal{H}(p).
