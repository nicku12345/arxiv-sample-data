Column closed pattern subgroups U of the finite upper unitriangular groups U_n(q) are defined as sets of matrices in U_n(q) having zeros in a prescribed set of columns besides the diagonal ones. We explain Jedlitschky's construction of monomial linearisation and apply this to C U yielding a generalisation of Yan's coadjoint cluster representations. Then we give a complete classification of the resulting supercharacters, by describing the resulting orbits and determining the Hom-spaces between orbit modules.
