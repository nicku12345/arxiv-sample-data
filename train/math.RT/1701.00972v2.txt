Recently, Chen and Koenig in \cite{CheKoe} and Iyama and Solberg in \cite{IyaSol} independently introduced and characterised algebras with dominant dimension coinciding with the Gorenstein dimension and both dimensions being larger than or equal to two. In \cite{IyaSol}, such algebras are named Auslander-Gorenstein algebras. Auslander-Gorenstein algebras generalise the well known class of higher Auslander algebras, where the dominant dimension additionally coincides with the global dimension. In this article we generalise Auslander-Gorenstein algebras further to algebras having the property that the dominant dimension coincides with the finitistic dimension and both dimension are at least two. We call such algebras finitistic Auslander algebras. As an application we can specialise to reobtain known results about Auslander-Gorenstein algebras and higher Auslander algebras such as the higher Auslander correspondence with a very short proof. We then give several conjectures and classes of examples for finitistic Auslander algebras. For a local Hopf algebra A and an indecomposable non-projective A-module M, we show that End_A(A \oplus M) is always a finitistic Auslander algebra of dominant dimension two. In particular this shows that Ext_A^1(M,M) is always non-zero, which generalises a result of Tachikawa who proved that Ext_A^1(M,M) \neq 0 for indecomposable non-projective modules M over group algebras of p-groups. We furthermore conjecture that every algebra of dominant dimension at least two which has exactly one projective non-injective indecomposable module is a finitistic Auslander algebra. We prove this conjecture for a large class of algebras which includes all representation-finite algebras.
