Let G be a simply connected semisimple algebraic group over \mathbb{C} and let \rho :G\rightarrow GL(V_\lambda) be an irreducible representation of highest weight \lambda. Suppose that \rho has finite kernel. Springer defined adjoint-invariant regular map with Zariski dense image from the group to its Lie algebra, \theta_\lambda:G\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}, which depends on \lambda [Kumar]. By a lemma in Kumar's recent paper, \theta_\lambda takes the maximal torus to its Lie algebra \mathfrak{t}. Thus, for a given simple group G and an irreducible representation V_\lambda, one may write \theta_\lambda (t)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n c_i(t)\check{\alpha_i}, where the simple co-roots \{\check{\alpha_i}\} are a basis for \mathfrak{t}. We give a complete determination of these coefficients c_i(t) for any simple group G as a sum over the weights of the torus action on V_\lambda.
