In this paper we study intertwining functors (Radon transforms) for twisted D-modules on partial flag varieties and their relation to the representations of semisimple Lie algebras. We show that certain intertwining functors give equivalences of derived categories of twisted D-modules. This is a generalization of a result by Marastoni. We also show that these intertwining functors from dominant to antidominant direction are compatible with taking global sections.
