If A and B are n- and m-representation finite k-algebras, then their tensor product \Lambda = A\otimes_k B is not in general (n+m)-representation finite. However, we prove that if A and B are acyclic and satisfy the weaker assumption of n- and m-completeness, then \Lambda is (n+m)-complete. This mirrors the fact that taking higher Auslander algebra does not preserve d-representation finiteness in general, but it does preserve d-completeness. As a corollary, we get the necessary condition for \Lambda to be (n+m)-representation finite which was found by Herschend and Iyama by using a certain twisted fractionally Calabi-Yau property.
