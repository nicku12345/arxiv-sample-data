It is well known that the normaized characters of integrable highest weight modules of given level over an affine Lie algebra \hat{\frak{g}} span an SL_2(\mathbf{Z})-invariant space. This result extends to admissible \hat{\frak{g}}-modules, where \frak{g} is a simple Lie algebra or osp_{1|n}. Applying the quantum Hamiltonian reduction (QHR) to admissible \hat{\frak{g}}-modules when \frak{g} =sl_2 (resp. =osp_{1|2}) one obtains minimal series modules over the Virasoro (resp. N=1 superconformal algebras), which form modular invariant families.   Another instance of modular invariance occurs for boundary level admissible modules, including when \frak{g} is a basic Lie superalgebra. For example, if \frak{g}=sl_{2|1} (resp. =osp_{3|2}), we thus obtain modular invariant families of \hat{\frak{g}}-modules, whose QHR produces the minimal series modules for the N=2 superconformal algebras (resp. a modular invariant family of N=3 superconformal algebra modules).   However, in the case when \frak{g} is a basic Lie superalgebra different from a simple Lie algebra or osp_{1|n}, modular invariance of normalized supercharacters of admissible \hat{\frak{g}}-modules holds outside of boundary levels only after their modification in the spirit of Zwegers' modification of mock theta functions. Applying the QHR, we obtain families of representations of N=2,3,4 and big N=4 superconformal algebras, whose modified (super)characters span an SL_2(\mathbf{Z})-invariant space.
