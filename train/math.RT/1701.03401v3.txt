Let \mathfrak l:= \mathfrak q(n)\times\mathfrak q(n), where \mathfrak q(n) denotes the queer Lie superalgebra. The associative superalgebra V of type Q(n) has a left and right action of \mathfrak q(n), and hence is equipped with a canonical \mathfrak l-module structure. We consider a distinguished basis \{D_\lambda\} of the algebra of \mathfrak l-invariant super-polynomial differential operators on V, which is indexed by strict partitions of length at most n. We show that the spectrum of the operator D_\lambda, when it acts on the algebra \mathscr P(V) of super-polynomials on V, is given by the factorial Schur Q-function of Okounkov and Ivanov. This constitutes a refinement and a new proof of a result of Nazarov, who computed the top-degree homogeneous part of the Harish-Chandra image of D_\lambda. As a further application, we show that the radial projections of the spherical super-polynomials corresponding to the diagonal symmetric pair (\mathfrak l,\mathfrak m), where \mathfrak m:=\mathfrak q(n), of irreducible \mathfrak l-submodules of \mathscr P(V) are the classical Schur Q-functions.
