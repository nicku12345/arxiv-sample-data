This paper first gives a necessary and sufficient condition that a lattice L can be represented as the collection of all up-sets of a poset. Applying the condition, it obtains a necessary and sufficient condition that a lattice can be embedded into the lattice L such that all infima, suprema, the top and bottom elements are preserved under the embedding by defining a monotonic operator on a poset. This paper finally shows that the quotient of the set of the monotonic operators under an equivalence relation can be naturally ordered and it is a lattice if L is a finite distributive lattice.
