Let F be a local non-archimedian field, G a semisimple F-group, dg a Haar measure on G and \mathcal S(G) be the space of locally constant complex valued functions f on G with compact support. For any regular elliptic congugacy class \Omega =h^G\subset G we denote by I_\Omega the G-invariant functional on \mathcal S (G) given by I_\Omega (f)=\int_G f(g^{-1}hg)dg This paper provides the spectral decomposition of functionals I_\Omega in the case G=PGL(2,F) and in the last section first steps of such an analysis for the general case.
