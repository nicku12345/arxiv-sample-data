We start the study of glider representations in the setting of semisimple Lie algebras. A glider representation is defined for some positively filtered ring FR and here we consider the right bounded algebra filtration FU(\mathfrak{g}) on the universal enveloping algebra U(\mathfrak{g}) of some semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} given by a fixed chain of semisimple sub Lie algebras \mathfrak{g}_1 \subset \mathfrak{g}_2 \subset \ldots \subset \mathfrak{g}_n = \mathfrak{g}. Inspired by the classical representation theory, we introduce so-called Verma glider representations. Their existence is related to the relations between the root systems of the appearing Lie algebras \mathfrak{g}_i. In particular, we consider chains of simple Lie algebras of the same type A,B,C and D.
