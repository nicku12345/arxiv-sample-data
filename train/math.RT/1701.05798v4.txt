The aim of this paper is to introduce and study a large class of \mathfrak{g}-module algebras which we call factorizable by generalizing the Gauss factorization of (square or rectangular) matrices. This class includes coordinate algebras of corresponding reductive groups G, their parabolic subgroups, basic affine spaces and many others. It turns out that tensor products of factorizable algebras are also factorizable and it is easy to create a factorizable algebra out of virtually any \mathfrak{g}-module algebra. We also have quantum versions of all these constructions in the category of U_q(\mathfrak{g})-module algebras. Quite surprisingly, our quantum factorizable algebras are naturally acted on by the quantized enveloping algebra U_q(\mathfrak{g}^*) of the dual Lie bialgebra \mathfrak{g}^* of \mathfrak{g}.
