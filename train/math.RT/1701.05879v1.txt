The spherical principal series representations \pi(\nu) of SL(2,\mathbb R) is a family of infinite dimensional representations parametrized by \nu\in\mathbb C. The representation \pi(\nu) is irreducible unless \nu is an odd integer, in which case it is indecomposable. We find a new continuous family of representations \Pi(\nu) such that \pi(\nu) and \Pi(\nu) have the same composition factors, and \Pi(\nu) is completely reducible, for all \nu. We also describe a connection between this construction and families of invariant Hermitian forms on the representations.
