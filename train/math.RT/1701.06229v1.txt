We prove the conjectual isomorphism between the level k \widehat{sl}_2-parafermion vertex operator algebra and the (k+1,k+2) minimal series W_k-algebra for all integers k \ge 2. As a consequence, we obtain the conjectural isomorphism between the (k+1,k+2) minimal series W_k-algebra and the coset vertex operator algebra SU(k)_1 \otimes SU(k)_1/SU(k)_2.
