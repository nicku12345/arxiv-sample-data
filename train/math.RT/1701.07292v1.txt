We introduce multi-colour partition algebras P_{n,m}(\delta_0, ..., \delta_{m-1}), which are generalization of both bubble algebras and partition algebras, then define the bubble algebra T_{n,m}(\delta_0, ..., \delta_{m-1}) as a sub-algebra of the algebra P_{n,m}(\delta_0, ..., \delta_{m-1}). We present general techniques to determine the structure of the bubble algebra over the complex field in the non-semisimple case.
