The aim of this note is to give a gentle introduction to algebras of partial triangulations of marked surfaces, following the structure of a talk given during the 49th symposium on ring theory and representation theory, held in Osaka. This class of algebras, which always have finite rank, contains classical Jacobian algebras of triangulations of marked surfaces and Brauer graph algebras. We discuss representation theoretical properties and derived equivalences. All results are proven in arXiv:1602.01592, under slightly milder hypotheses.
