Let  \mathbb{A} be a cellular algebra over a field \mathbb{F} with a decomposition of the identity  1_{\mathbb{A}}  into orthogonal idempotents  e_i, i \in I (for some finite set I) satisfying some properties. We describe the entire Loewy structure of cell modules of the algebra  \mathbb{A}  by using the representation theory of the algebra  e_i \mathbb{A} e_i  for each  i . Moreover, we also study the block theory of \mathbb{A} by using this decomposition.
