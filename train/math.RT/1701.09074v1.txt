Let A=KQ_A/I_A and B=KQ_B/I_B be two finite-dimensional bound quiver algebras, fix two vertices a\in Q_A and b\in Q_B. We define an algebra \Lambda=KQ_\Lambda/I_\Lambda, which is called a simple gluing algebra of A and B, where Q_\Lambda is from Q_A and Q_B by identifying a and b, I_\Lambda=\langle I_A,I_B\rangle. We prove that \Lambda is Gorenstein if and only if A and B are Gorenstein, and describe the Gorenstein projective modules, singularity category, Gorenstein defect category and also Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebra of \Lambda from the corresponding ones of A and B.
