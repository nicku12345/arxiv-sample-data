The Kashiwara crystal B(\infty) parametrizes a basis for the Verma module of a Kac-Moody algebra. It has a deep combinatorial structure which one seeks to understand. For each sequence J of reduced decompositions of elements of the Weyl group W, it has a realization as a subset B_J(\infty) of a crystal B_J which as a set is just J copies of the natural numbers. The goal is to determine B_J(\infty) and in particular to show that it is a polyhedral subset of B_J. In earlier work this led to the notion of an S-graph associated to a given simple root \alpha. Here the notion of a giant S-graph depending on a fixed simple root is introduced. It is essentially a union of S-graphs for each simple root with one distinguished vertex depending on \alpha. Its vertices, which forms a giant S-set, determine a set of dual Kashiwara functions. These are linear functions on B_J, whose common maximum determines the dual Kashiwara parameter with respect to \alpha. From these parameters one may compute B_J(\infty) as an explicit polyhedral subset of B_J.   For W finite, Berenstein and Zelevinsky had studied this problem by introducing the notion of a trail in a fundamental module. The functions they define may also be viewed as a set of dual Kashiwara functions. The goal is to relate these two approaches and without restriction on W. It is shown under the hypothesis that no "false" trails exist, that the set of trails determines the "Z-convex envelope" of a giant S-set. The proof involves the study of identities in Demazure modules.
