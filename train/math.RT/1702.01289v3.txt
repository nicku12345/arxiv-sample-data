Let \mathfrak g be a complex simple Lie algebra and let U_{\zeta}({\mathfrak g}) be the corresponding Lusztig {\mathbb Z}[q,q^{-1}]-form of the quantized enveloping algebra specialized to an \ellth root of unity. Moreover, let \mod(U_{\zeta}({\mathfrak g})) be the braided monoidal category of finite-dimensional modules for U_{\zeta}({\mathfrak g}). In this paper we classify the thick tensor ideals of \mod(U_{\zeta}({\mathfrak g})) and compute the prime spectrum of the stable module category associated to \text{mod}(U_{\zeta}({\mathfrak g})) as defined by Balmer.
