Let \Lambda be a finite-dimensional algebra with finite global dimension, R_k=K[X]/(X^k) be the \mathcal{Z}-graded local ring with k\geq1, and \Lambda_k=\Lambda\otimes_K R_k. We consider the singularity category \mathcal{D}_{sg}(\mathrm{mod}^\mathcal{Z}(\Lambda_k)) of the graded modules over \Lambda_k. It is showed that there is a tilting object in \mathcal{D}_{sg}(\mathrm{mod}^\mathcal{Z}(\Lambda_k)) such that its endomorphism algebra is isomorphic to the triangular matrix algebra T_{k-1}(\Lambda) with coefficients in \Lambda and there is a triangulated equivalence between \mathcal{D}_{sg}(\mathrm{mod}^{\mathcal{Z}/k\mathcal{Z}}(\Lambda)) and the root category of T_{k-1}(\Lambda). Finally, a classification of \Lambda_k up to the Cohen-Macaulay representation type is given.
