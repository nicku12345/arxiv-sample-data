For any special nilpotent orbit, let \frac{1}{2}h^{\vee} be one half of the semisimple element of a Jacobson-Morozov triple associated to the orbit. In 1985, Barbasch and Vogan defined the notion of special unipotent representations with infinitesimal character (\frac{1}{2}h^{\vee},\frac{1}{2}h^{\vee}). Some properties of such representations were discovered when \frac{1}{2}h^{\vee} is integral. In this manuscript, we give a complete proof of these properties when \frac{1}{2}h^{\vee} is not integral.
