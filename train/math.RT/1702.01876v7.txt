Let G be a connected complex simple Lie group, and let \widehat{G}^{\mathrm{d}} be the set of all equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations with non-vanishing Dirac cohomology. We show that \widehat{G}^{\mathrm{d}} consists of two parts: finitely many scattered representations, and finitely many strings of representations. Moreover, the strings of \widehat{G}^{\mathrm{d}} come from \widehat{L}^{\mathrm{d}} via cohomological induction and they are all in the good range. Here L runs over the Levi factors of proper \theta-stable parabolic subgroups of G. It follows that figuring out \widehat{G}^{\mathrm{d}} requires a finite calculation in total. As an application, we report a complete description of \widehat{F}_4^{\mathrm{d}}.
