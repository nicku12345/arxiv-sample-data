For a symmetric pair (G,H) of reductive groups we extend to a large class of generalized principal series representations our previous construction of meromorphic families of symmetry breaking operators. These operators intertwine between a possibly vector-valued principal series of G and one for H and are given explicitly in terms of their integral kernels. As an application we give a complete classification of symmetry breaking operators from spinors on a Euclidean space to spinors on a hyperplane, intertwining for a double cover of the conformal group of the hyperplane.
