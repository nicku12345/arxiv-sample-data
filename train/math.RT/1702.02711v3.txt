Kostka functions K^{\pm}_{\lambda, \mu}(t) associated to complex reflection groups are a generalization of Kostka polynomials, which are indexed by r-partitions \lambda, \mu and a sign +, -. It is known that Kostka polynomials have an interpretation in terms of Lusztig's partition function. Finkelberg and Ionov defined alternate functions K_{\lambda,\mu}(t) by using an analogue of Lusztig's partition function, and showed that K_{\lambda,\mu}(t) are polynomials in t with non-negative integer coefficients. They conjecture that their K_{\lambda,\mu}(t) coincide with K^-_{\lambda,\mu}(t). In this paper, we show that their conjecture holds. We also discuss a multi-variable version of Kostka functions.
