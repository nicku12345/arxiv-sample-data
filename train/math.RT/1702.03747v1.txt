Let G_n=U(n)\ltimes {\mathbb H}_n  be the semi-direct product of the unitary group acting by automorphisms on the Heisenberg group {\mathbb H}_n. According to Lipsman, the unitary dual \widehat {G_n}  of G_n  is in one to one correspondence with the space of admissible coadjoint orbits \mathfrak g_n^\ddagger /G_n  of G_n . In this paper, we determine the topology of the space \mathfrak g_n^\ddagger /G_n  and we show that the correspondence with \widehat {G_n}  is a homeomorphism.
