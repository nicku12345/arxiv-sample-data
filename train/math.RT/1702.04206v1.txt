We investigate the generalized Kronecker algebra \mathcal{K}_r = k\Gamma_r with r \geq 3 arrows. Given a regular component \mathcal{C} of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of \mathcal{K}_r, we show that the quasi-rank rk(\mathcal{C}) \in \mathbb{Z}_{\leq 1} can be described almost exactly as the distance \mathcal{W}(\mathcal{C}) \in \mathbb{N}_0 between two non-intersecting cones in \mathcal{C}, given by modules with the equal images and the equal kernels property; more precisley, we show that the two numbers are linked by the inequality \[ -\mathcal{W}(\mathcal{C}) \leq rk(\mathcal{C}) \leq - \mathcal{W}(\mathcal{C}) + 3.\] Utilizing covering theory, we construct for each n \in \mathbb{N}_0 a bijection \varphi_n between the field k and \{ \mathcal{C} \mid \mathcal{C} \ \text{regular component}, \ \mathcal{W}(\mathcal{C}) = n \}. As a consequence, we get new results about the number of regular components of a fixed quasi-rank.
