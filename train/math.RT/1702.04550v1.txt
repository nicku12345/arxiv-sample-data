We show that for the path algebra A of an acyclic quiver, the singularity category of the derived category \mathsf{D}^{\rm b}(\mathsf{mod}\,A) is triangle equivalent to the derived category of the functor category of \underline{\mathsf{mod}}\,A, that is, \mathsf{D}_{\rm sg}(\mathsf{D}^{\rm b}(\mathsf{mod}\,A))\simeq \mathsf{D}^{\rm b}(\mathsf{mod}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}\,A)). This extends a result of Iyama-Oppermann for the path algebra A of a Dynkin quiver. An important step is to establish a functor category analog of Happel's triangle equivalence for repetitive algebras.
