Let Z be a unimodular real spherical space. We develop a theory of constant terms for tempered functions on Z which parallels the work of Harish-Chandra. The constant terms f_I of an eigenfunction f are parametrized by subsets I of the set S of spherical roots which determine the fine geometry of Z at infinity. Constant terms are transitive i.e. (f_J)_I=f_I for I\subset J, and our main result is a quantitative bound of the difference f-f_I, which is uniform in the parameter of the eigenfunction.
