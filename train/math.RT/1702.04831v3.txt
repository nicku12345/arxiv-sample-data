We verify that universal classes in the cohomology of GL_N determine explicit cohomology classes of Frobenius kernels G_{(r)} of various linear algebraic groups G . We consider the relationship of \varprojlim_r H^*(U_{(r)},k) to the rational cohomology H^*(U,k) of many unipotent algebraic groups U. The second half of this paper investigates in detail the cohomology of Frobenius kernels (U_3)_{(r)} of the Heisenberg group U_3 \subset GL_3.
