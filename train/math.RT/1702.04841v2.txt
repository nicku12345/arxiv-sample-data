The results in this paper provide a comparison between the K-structure of unipotent representations and regular sections of bundles on nilpotent orbits. Precisely, let \widetilde{G_0} =\widetilde{Spin}(a,b) with a+b=2n, the nonlinear double cover of Spin(a,b), and let \widetilde{K}=Spin(a, \mathbb C)\times Spin(b, \mathbb C) be the complexification of the maximal compact subgroup of \widetilde{G_0}. We consider the nilpotent orbit \mathcal O_c parametrized by [3 \ 2^{2k} \ 1^{2n-4k-3}] with k>0. We provide a list of unipotent representations that are genuine, and prove that the list is complete using the coherent continuation representation. Separately we compute \widetilde{K}-spectra of the regular functions on certain real forms \mathcal O of \mathcal O_c transforming according to appropriate characters \psi under C_{\widetilde{K}}(\mathcal O), and then match them with the \widetilde{K}-types of the genuine unipotent representations. The results provide instances for the orbit philosophy.
