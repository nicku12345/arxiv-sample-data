Based on recent work of Kaletha, we apply Hakim--Murnaghan's result to study distinguished regular supercuspidal representations of tamely ramified reductive p-adic groups. Assuming p is sufficiently large, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for regular supercuspidal representations to be distinguished. We also investigate the relation between the distinction problem and the Langlands functoriality, and confirm a conjecture of Lapid for regular depth-zero or epipelagic supercuspidal representations.
