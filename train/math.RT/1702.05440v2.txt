Given an odd prime p, we investigate the position of simple modules in the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of the principal block of a finite group with non-cyclic abelian Sylow p-subgroups. In particular, we prove a reduction to finite simple groups. In the case that the characteristic is 3, we prove that simple modules in the principal block all lie at the end of their components
