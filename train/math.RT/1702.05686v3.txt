Let {\bf G} be a simply connected semisimple algebraic group over \Bbbk=\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q, the algebraically closure of \mathbb{F}_q (the finite field with q=p^e elements), and F be the standard Frobenius map. Let {\bf B} be an F-stable Borel subgroup and {\bf T} an F-stable maximal torus contained in {\bf B}. Set G_{q^r}={\bf G}^{F^r} and B_{q^r}={\bf B}^{F^r} for any r>0. This paper studies the original induced module \op{Ind}_{\bf B}^{\bf G}\lambda=\Bbbk{\bf G}\otimes_{\Bbbk{\bf B}}\lambda (here \Bbbk{\bf H} is the group algebra of the group {\bf H}, and \lambda is a rational character of {\bf T} regarded as a {\bf B}-module). We show that if \lambda is regular and dominant, then there is a surjective {\bf G}-module homomorphism \op{Ind}_{B_{q^r}}^{\bf G}\lambda\rightarrow \op{St}\otimes L(\lambda) for any r>0, where \op{St} is the infinite dimensional Steinberg module defined by Nanhua Xi. As a consequence, we show that \op{Ind}_{\bf B}^{\bf G}\lambda is irreducible if \lambda if and only if \lambda is regular and antidominant. Moreover, for {\bf G}=SL_2(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q) and 0<\lambda<p, we show that \op{Ind}_{\bf B}^{\bf G}\lambda have infinite many composition factors with each finite dimensional. Consequently, we find certain \lambda for which \op{Ind}_{\bf B}^{\bf G}\lambda has an infinite submodule filtration for the general {\bf G}.
