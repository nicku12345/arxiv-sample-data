We show that for any singular dominant integral weight \lambda of a complex semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}, the endomorphism algebra B of any projective-injective module of the parabolic BGG category \mathcal{O}_\lambda^{\mathfrak{p}} is a symmetric algebra (as conjectured by Khovanov) extending the results of Mazorchuk and Stroppel for the regular dominant integral weight. Moreover, the endomorphism algebra B is equipped with a homogeneous (non-degenerate) symmetrizing form. In the appendix, there is a short proof due to K. Coulembier and V. Mazorchuk showing that the endomorphism algebra B_\lambda^{\mathfrak{p}} of the basic projective-injective module of \mathcal{O}_\lambda^{\mathfrak{p}} is a symmetric algebra.
