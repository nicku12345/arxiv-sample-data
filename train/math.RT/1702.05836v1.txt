We study the structure of the (\mathfrak{g},K)-modules of the principal series representations of SL(3,\mathbb{R}) and Sp(2,\mathbb{R}) induced from minimal parabolic subgroups, in the case when the infinitesimal character is nonsingular. The composition factors of these modules are known by Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan conjecture. In this paper, we give complete descriptions of the socle filtrations of these modules.
