In this paper, we introduce the notion of excellent extension of rings. Let \Gamma be an excellent extension of an artin algebra \Lambda, we prove that \Lambda satisfies the Gorenstein symmetry conjecture (resp. finitistic dimension conjecture, Auslander-Gorenstein conjecture, Nakayama conjecture) if and only if so does \Gamma. As a special case of excellent extensions, if G is a finite group whose order is invertible in \Lambda acting on \Lambda and \Lambda is G-stable, we prove that if the skew group algebras \Lambda G satisfies strong Nakayama conjecture (resp. generalized Nakayama conjecture), then so does \Lambda.
