Let  H  be a compact subgroup of a locally compact group G. In this paper we define a convolution on  M(G/H) , the space of all complex bounded Radon measures on the homogeneous space G/H. Then we prove that the measure space  M(G/H, *)  is a non-unital Banach algebra that possesses an approximate identity. Finally, it is shown that the Banach algebra  M(G/H, *)  is not involutive and also  L^1(G/H, *)  is a two-sided ideal of it.
