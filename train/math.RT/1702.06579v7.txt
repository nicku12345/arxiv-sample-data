We settle a long-standing problem in the theory of Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups by constructing many (graded) integral cellular bases of these algebras. As applications, we explicitly construct the simple modules of Ariki's categorification theorem and prove unitriangularity of decomposition matrices over arbitrary fields, we also prove Martin-Woodcock's conjecture.
