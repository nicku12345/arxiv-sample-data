Let K\Delta be the incidence algebra associated with a finite poset (\Delta,\preceq) over the algebraically closed field K. We present a study of incidence algebras K\Delta that are piecewise hereditary, which we denominate PHI algebras. We investigate the strong global dimension, the simply conectedeness and the one-point extension algebras over a PHI algebras.   We also give a positive answer to the so-called Skowro\'nski problem for K\Delta a PHI algebra which is not of wild quiver type. That is for this kind of algebra we show that HH^1(K\Delta) is trivial if, and only if, K\Delta is a simply connected algebra. We determine an upper bound for the strong global dimension of PHI algebras; furthermore, we extend this result to sincere algebras proving that the strong global dimension of a sincere piecewise hereditary algebra is less or equal than three.
