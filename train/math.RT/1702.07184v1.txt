In this short note, we will give an efficient functorial proof of the equivalence of various characterisations of purity in a locally finitely presented additive category C. The complications of the proofs for specific choices of C (e.g. C=A\text{-Mod} for a ring A) are contained in the description of fp-injective and injective objects in (\text{fp}C,\text{Ab}). For example, the equivalence of many characterisations of purity in a module category A\text{-Mod} is a simple corollary of what we will prove here, once we know that \text{Fpinj}(A\text{-mod},\text{Ab}) and \text{Inj}(A\text{-mod},\text{Ab}) look like (we do).
