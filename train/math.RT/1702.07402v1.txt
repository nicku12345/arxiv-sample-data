In this article, as always we will start by deliberating at our project's historical general view and then we will try to construct a new Poisson bracket on our simplest example sl_2 and then we will try to give a universal construction based on our universal variables and then will try to construct lattice W_2 algebras which will play a key role in our other constructions on lattice W_3 algebras and finally we will try to find the only non trivial dependent generator of our lattice W_4 algebras and so on for lattice W_n algebras. And in the late of this article we will have appendix A, which will contain some parts of the Mathematica coding which we have used and have made for to find our algebra structures.
