We consider the algebra \mathcal O(\mathsf M) of observables and the (formally) versal morphism \eta: A \to \mathcal O(\mathsf M) defined by the noncommutative deformation functor \mathsf{Def}_{\mathsf M} of a family \mathsf M = \{ M_1, \dots, M_r \} of right modules over an associative k-algebra A. By the Generalized Burnside Theorem, due to Laudal, \eta is an isomorphism when A is finite dimensional, \mathsf M is the family of simple A-modules, and k is an algebraically closed field. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we prove a form of the Generalized Burnside Theorem that is more general, where there is no assumption on the field k. Secondly, we prove that the \mathcal O-construction is a closure operation when A is any finitely generated k-algebra and \mathsf M is any family of finite dimensional A-modules, in the sense that \eta_B: B \to \mathcal O^B(\mathsf M) is an isomorphism when B = \mathcal O(\mathsf M) and \mathsf M is considered as a family of B-modules.
