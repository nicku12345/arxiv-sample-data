In 2000, Dergachev and Kirillov introduced subalgebras of "seaweed type" in \mathfrak{gl}_n and computed their index using certain graphs, which we call type-{\sf A} meander graphs. Then the subalgebras of seaweed type, or just "seaweeds", have been defined by Panyushev (2001) for arbitrary reductive Lie algebras. Recently, a meander graph approach to computing the index in types {\sf B} and {\sf C} has been developed by the authors. In this article, we consider the most difficult and interesting case of type {\sf D}. Some new phenomena occurring here are related to the fact that the Dynkin diagram has a branching node.
