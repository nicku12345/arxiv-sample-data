This paper provides a comparison between the K-structure of unipotent representations and regular sections of bundles on nilpotent orbits for complex groups of type D. Precisely, let  G_ 0 =Spin(2n,\mathbb C) be the Spin complex group viewed as a real group, and K\cong G_0 be the complexification of the maximal compact subgroup of G_0. We compute K-spectra of the regular functions on some small nilpotent orbits \mathcal O transforming according to characters \psi of C_{ K}(\mathcal O) trivial on the connected component of the identity C_{ K}(\mathcal O)^0. We then match them with the {K}-types of the genuine (i.e. representations which do not factor to SO(2n,\mathbb C)) unipotent representations attached to \mathcal O.
