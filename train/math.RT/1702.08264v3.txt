Let X be a spherical variety for a connected reductive group G. Work of Gaitsgory-Nadler strongly suggests that the Langlands dual group G^\vee of G has a subgroup whose Weyl group is the little Weyl group of X. Sakellaridis-Venkatesh defined a refined dual group G^\vee_X and verified in many cases that there exists an isogeny \phi from G^\vee_X to G^\vee. In this paper, we establish the existence of \phi in full generality. Our approach is purely combinatorial and works (despite the title) for arbitrary G-varieties.
