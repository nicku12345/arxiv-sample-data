In this note, we show that the free generators of the Mishchenko-Fomenko subalgebra of a complex reductive Lie algebra, constructed by the argument shift method at a regular element, form a regular sequence. This result was proven by Serge Ovsienko in the type A at a regular and semisimple element. Our approach is very different, and is strongly based on geometric properties of the nilpotent bicone.
