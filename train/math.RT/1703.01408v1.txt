We survey results on multiserial algebras, special multiserial algebras and Brauer configuration algebras. A structural property of modules over a special multiserial algebra is presented. Almost gentle algebras are introduced and we describe some results related to this class of algebras. We also report on the structure of radical cubed zero symmetric algebras.
