We study an analogue of the Achar-Riche "mixed modular derived category" for moment graphs. In particular, given a Coxeter group W and a reflection faithful representation \mathfrak{h}, we introduce a category that plays the role of Schubert-stratified mixed modular perverse sheaves on "the flag variety associated to (W, \mathfrak{h})." We show that this Soergel-theoretic generalization of graded category \mathcal{O} is graded highest weight.
