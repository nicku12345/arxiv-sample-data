We generalize the modular Koszul duality of Achar-Riche to the setting of Soergel bimodules associated to any finite Coxeter system. The key new tools are a functorial monodromy action and wall-crossing functors in the mixed modular derived category. In characteristic 0, this duality together with Soergel's conjecture (proved by Elias-Williamson) imply that our Soergel-theoretic graded category \mathcal{O} is Koszul self-dual, generalizing the result of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel.
