Frieze patterns have an interesting combinatorial structure, which has proven very useful in the study of cluster algebras. We introduce (k,n)-frieze patterns, a natural generalisation of the classical notion. A generalisation of the bijective correspondence between frieze patterns of width n and clusters of Pl\"ucker coordinates in the cluster structure of the Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}(2,n+3) is obtained.
