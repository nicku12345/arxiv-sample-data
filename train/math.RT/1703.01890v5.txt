Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, and let V be a finite-dimensional vector space. Let End(V) be the semigroup of all polynomial endomorphisms of V. Let E be a subset of End(V) which is a linear subspace and also a semi-subgroup. Both End(V) and E are ind-varieties which act on V in the obvious way. In this paper, we study important aspects of such actions. We assign to E a linear subspace D_{E} of the vector fields on V. A subvariety X of V is said to D_{E} -invariant if h(x) is in the tangent space of x for all h in D_{E} and x in X. We show that X is D_{E} -invariant if and only if it is the union of E-orbits. For such X, we define first integrals and construct a quotient space for the E-action. An important case occurs when G is an algebraic subgroup of GL(V) and E consists of the G-equivariant polynomial endomorphisms. In this case, the associated D_{E} is the space the G-invariant vector fields. A significant question here is whether there are non-constant G-invariant first integrals on X. As examples, we study the adjoint representation, orbit closures of highest weight vectors, and representations of the additive group. We also look at finite-dimensional irreducible representations of SL2 and its nullcone.
