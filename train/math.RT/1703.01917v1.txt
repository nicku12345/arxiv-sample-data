Let ZB be the center of a p-block B of a finite group with defect group D. We show that the Loewy length LL(ZB) of ZB is bounded by \frac{|D|}{p}+p-1 provided D is not cyclic. If D is non-abelian, we prove the stronger bound LL(ZB)<\min\{p^{d-1},4p^{d-2}\} where |D|=p^d. Conversely, we classify the blocks B with LL(ZB)\ge\min\{p^{d-1},4p^{d-2}\}. This extends some results previously obtained by the present authors. Moreover, we characterize blocks with uniserial center.
