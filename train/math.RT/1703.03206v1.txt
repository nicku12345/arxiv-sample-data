Let G be a linear connected non-compact real simple Lie group and let K\subset G be a maximal compact subgroup of G. Suppose that the centre of K isomorphic to \mathbb{S}^1 so that G/K is a global Hermitian symmetric space. Let \theta be the Cartan involution of G that fixes K. Let \Lambda be a uniform lattice in G such that \theta(\Lambda)=\Lambda. Suppose that G is one of the groups SU(p,q), p<q-1, q\ge 5, SO_0(2,q), Sp(n,\mathbb{R}), n\ne 4, SO^*(2n), n\ge 9. Then there exists a unique irreducible unitary representation \mathcal{A}_\mathfrak{q} associated to a proper \theta-stable parabolic subalgebra \mathfrak{q} with R_+(\mathfrak{q})=R_-(\mathfrak{q}) such that if H^{s,s}(\mathfrak{g},K;A_{\mathfrak{q}',K})\ne 0 for some 0<s\le R_+(\mathfrak{q}), then \mathcal{A}_{\mathfrak{q}'} is unitarily equivalent to either the trivial representation or to  \mathcal{A}_{\mathfrak{q}}. As a consequence, under suitable hypotheses on \Lambda, we show that the multiplicity of \mathcal{A}_\mathfrak{q} occurring in L^2(\Gamma\backslash G) is positive for {\it any} torsionless lattice \Gamma\subset G commensurable with \Lambda.
