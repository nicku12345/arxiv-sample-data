To a smooth and symmetric function f defined on a symmetric open set \Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^{n} and a real n-dimensional vector space V we assign an associated operator function F defined on an open subset \Omega\subset\mathcal{L}(V) of linear transformations of V, such that for each inner product g on V, on the subspace \Sigma_{g}(V)\subset\mathcal{L}(V) of g-selfadjoint operators, F_{g}=F_{|\Sigma_{g}(V)} is the isotropic function associated to f, which means that F_{g}(A)=f(\mathrm{EV}(A)), where \mathrm{EV}(A) denotes the ordered n-tuple of real eigenvalues of A. We extend some well known relations between the derivatives of f and each F_{g} to relations between f and F. By means of an example we show that well known regularity properties of F_{g} do not carry over to F.
