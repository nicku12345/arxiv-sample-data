We provide an explicit construction of representations in the discrete spectrum of two p-adic symmetric spaces. We consider \mathbf{GL}_n(F) \times \mathbf{GL}_n(F) \backslash \mathbf{GL}_{2n}(F) and \mathbf{GL}_n(F) \backslash \mathbf{GL}_n(E), where E is a quadratic Galois extension of a nonarchimedean local field F of characteristic zero and odd residual characteristic. The proof of the main result involves an application of a symmetric space version of Casselman's Criterion for square integrability due to Kato and Takano.
