The ADR algebra R_A of an Artin algebra A is a right ultra strongly quasihereditary algebra (RUSQ algebra). In this paper we study the \Delta-filtrations of modules over RUSQ algebras and determine the projective covers of a certain class of R_A-modules. As an application, we give a counterexample to a claim by Auslander-Platzeck-Todorov, concerning projective resolutions over the ADR algebra.
