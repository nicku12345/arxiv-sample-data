Let \cQ be a quiver and K a field. We study the interrelationship of homological properties of algebras associated to convex subquivers of \cQ and quotients of the path algebra K\cQ. We introduce the homological heart of \cQ which is a particularly nice convex subquiver of \cQ. For any algebra of the form K\cQ/I, the algebra associated to K\cQ/I and the homological heart have similar homological properties. We give an application showing that the finitistic dimension conjecture need only be proved for algebras with path connected quivers.
