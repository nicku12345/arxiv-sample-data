The purpose of the present paper is to investigate a fusion rule algebra arising from irreducible characters of a compact group G and a closed subgroup G_0 of G with finite index. The convolution of this fusion rule algebra is introduced by inducing irreducible representations of G_0 to G and by restricting irreducible representations of G to G_0.
