We classify a class of 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras related to the representations of the Clifford algebras in the following way. Let J\colon \Cl(\mathbb R^{r,s})\toU be a representation of the Clifford algebra \Cl(\mathbb R^{r,s}) generated by the pseudo Euclidean vector space \mathbb R^{r,s}. Assume that the Clifford module U is endowed with a bilinear symmetric non-degenerate real form \la\cdot\,,\cdot\ra_U making the linear map J_z skew symmetric for any z\in\mathbb R^{r,s}. The Lie algebras and the Clifford algebras are related by \la J_zv,w\ra_U=\la z,[v,w]\ra_{\mathbb R^{r,s}}, z\in \mathbb R^{r,s}, v,w\in U. We detect the isomorphic and non-isomorphic Lie algebras according to the dimension of U and the range of the non-negative integers~r,s.
