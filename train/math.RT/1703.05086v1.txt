Let G be a locally semisimple ind-group, P be a parabolic subgroup, and E be a finite-dimensional P-module. We show that, under a certain condition on E, the nonzero cohomologies of the homogeneous vector bundle \mathcal{O}_{G/P}(E^*) on G/P induced by the dual P-module E^* decompose as direct sums of cohomologies of bundles of the form \mathcal{O}_{G/P}(R) for (some) simple constituents R of E^*. In the finite-dimensional case, this result is a consequence of the Bott-Borel-Weil theorem and Weyl's semisimplicity theorem. In the infinite-dimensional setting we consider, there is no relevant semisimplicity theorem. Instead, our results are based on the injectivity of the cohomologies of the bundles \mathcal{O}_{G/P}(R).
