Khovanov-Lauda define a 2-category \mathcal{U} such that the split Grothendieck group K_0(\mathcal{U}) is isomorphic to an integral version of the quantized universal enveloping algebra \mathbf{U}(\mathfrak{sl}_n), n \geq 2. Beliakova-Habiro-Lauda-Webster prove that the trace decategorification of the Khovanov-Lauda 2-category is isomorphic to the the current algebra \mathbf{U}(\mathfrak{sl}_n [t]) - the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra  \mathfrak{sl}_n \otimes \mathbb{C} [t]. A 2-representation of \,\mathcal{U} is a 2-functor from \mathcal{U} to a linear, additive 2-category. In this note we are interested in the 2-representation, defined by Khovanov-Lauda using bimodules over cohomology rings of flag varieties. This 2-representation induces an action of the current algebra \mathbf{U}(\mathfrak{sl}_n [t]) on the cohomology rings. We explicitly compute the action of \mathbf{U}(\mathfrak{sl}_n [t]) generators using the trace functor. It turns out that the obtained current algebra module is related to another family of \mathbf{U}(\mathfrak{sl}_n [t])-modules, called local Weyl modules. Using known results about the cohomology rings, we are able to provide a new proof of the character formula for the local Weyl modules.
