We introduce admissible group actions on cluster algebras, cluster categories and quivers with potential and study the resulting orbit spaces. The orbit space of the cluster algebra has the structure of a generalized cluster algebra. This generalized cluster structure is different from those introduced by Chekhov-Shapiro and Lam-Pylyavskyy. For group actions on cluster algebras from surfaces, we describe the generalized cluster structure of the orbit space in terms of a triangulated orbifold. In this case, we give a complete list of exchange polynomials, and we classify the algebras of rank 1 and 2. We also show that every admissible group action on a cluster category induces a precovering from the cluster category to the cluster category of orbits. Moreover this precovering is dense if the categories are of finite type.
