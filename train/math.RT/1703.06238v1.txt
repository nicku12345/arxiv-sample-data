Let \rk be a local field of characteristic zero. Let \pi be an irreducible admissible smooth representation of \GL_{2n}(\rk). We prove that for all but countably many characters \chi of \GL_n(\rk)\times \GL_n(\rk), the space of \chi-equivariant (continuous in the archimedean case) linear functionals on \pi is at most one dimensional. Using this, we prove the uniqueness of twisted Shalika models.
