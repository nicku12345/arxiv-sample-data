Let \Lambda be a finite dimensional string algebra over a field with the quiver Q such that the underlying graph of Q is a tree, and let |\Det(\Lambda)| be the number of the minimal right determiners of all irreducible morphisms between indecomposable left \Lambda-modules. Then we have |\Det(\Lambda)|=2n-p-q-1, where n is the number of vertices in Q, p=|\{i\mid i is a source in Q with two neighbours\}| and q is the number of non-zero vertex ideals of \Lambda.
