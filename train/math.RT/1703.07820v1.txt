We show that a separable equivalence between symmetric algebras preserves the dominant dimensions of certain endomorphism algebras of modules. We apply this to show that the dominant dimension of the category coMack(B) of cohomological Mackey functors of a p-block B of a finite group with a nontrivial defect group is 2.
