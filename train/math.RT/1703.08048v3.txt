If {\mathfrak g} is a real reductive Lie algebra and {\mathfrak h} < {\mathfrak g} is a subalgebra, then ({\mathfrak g}, {\mathfrak h}) is called real spherical provided that {\mathfrak g} = {\mathfrak h} + {\mathfrak p} for some choice of a minimal parabolic subalgebra {\mathfrak p} \subset {\mathfrak g}. In this paper we classify all real spherical pairs ({\mathfrak g}, {\mathfrak h}) where {\mathfrak g} is semi-simple but not simple and {\mathfrak h} is a reductive real algebraic subalgebra. The paper is based on the classification of the case where {\mathfrak g} is simple (see arXiv:1609.00963) and generalizes the results of Brion and Mikityuk in the (complex) spherical case.
