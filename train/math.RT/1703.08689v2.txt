Let G be a p-adic group that splits over an unramified extension. We decompose Rep_{\Lambda}^{0}(G), the abelian category of smooth level 0 representations of G with coefficients in \Lambda=\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell} or \overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{\ell}, into a product of subcategories indexed by inertial Langlands parameters. We construct these categories via systems of idempotents on the Bruhat-Tits building and Deligne-Lusztig theory. Then, we prove compatibilities with parabolic induction and restriction functors and the local Langlands correspondence.
