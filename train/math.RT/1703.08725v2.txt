Let A be a (left and right) Noetherian ring that is semiperfect. Let e be an idempotent of A and consider the ring \Gamma:=(1-e)A(1-e) and the semi-simple right A-module S_e : = eA/e{\rm rad}A. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the global dimensions of A and \Gamma, by using the homological properties of S_e. More precisely, we consider the Yoneda ring Y(e):={\rm Ext}^*_A(S_e,S_e) of e. We prove that if Y(e) is artinian of finite global dimension, then A has finite global dimension if and only if so is \Gamma. We also investigate the situation where both A,\Gamma have finite global dimension. When A is Koszul and finite dimensional, this implies that Y(e) has finite global dimension. We end the paper with a reduction technique to compute the Cartan determiant of artin algebras. We prove that if Y(e) has finite global dimension, then the Cartan determinants of A and \Gamma coincide. This provides a new way to approach the long-standing Cartan determinant conjecture.
