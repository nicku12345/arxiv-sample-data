The author's work with Murnaghan on distinguished tame supercuspidal representations is re-examined using a simplified treatment of Jiu-Kang Yu's construction of tame supercuspidal representations of p-adic reductive groups. This leads to a unification of aspects of the theories of distinguished cuspidal representations over p-adic and finite fields.
