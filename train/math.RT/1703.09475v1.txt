Given a (complex, smooth) irreducible representation \pi of the general linear group over a non-archimedean local field and an irreducible supercuspidal representation \sigma of a classical group, we show that the (normalized) parabolic induction \pi\rtimes\sigma is reducible if there exists \rho in the supercuspidal support of \pi such that \rho\rtimes\sigma is reducible. In special cases we also give irreducibility criteria for \pi\rtimes\sigma when the above condition is not satisfied.
