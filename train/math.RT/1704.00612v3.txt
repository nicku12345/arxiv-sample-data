For monomial special multiserial algebras, which in general are of wild representation type, we construct radical embeddings into algebras of finite representation type. As a consequence, we show that the representation dimension of monomial and self-injective special multiserial algebras is less or equal to three. This implies that the finitistic dimension conjecture holds for all special multiserial algebras.
