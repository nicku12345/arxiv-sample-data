We establish character formulae for representations of the one-parameter family of simple Lie superalgebras D(2|1;\zeta). We provide a complete description of the Verma flag multiplicities of the tilting modules and the projective modules in the BGG category \mathcal O of D(2|1;\zeta)-modules of integral weights, for any complex parameter \zeta. The composition factors of all Verma modules in \mathcal O are then obtained.
