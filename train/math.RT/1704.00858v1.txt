We give necessary and sufficient conditions for torsion pairs in a hereditary category to be in bijection with t-structures in the bounded derived category of that hereditary category. We prove that the existence of a split t-structure with nontrivial heart in a semiconnected Krull-Schmidt category implies that this category is equivalent to the derived category of a hereditary category. We construct a bijection between split torsion pairs in the module category of a tilted algebra having a complete slice in the preinjective component with corresponding t-structures. Finally, we classify split t-structures in the derived category of a hereditary algebra.
