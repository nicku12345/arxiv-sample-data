We construct new families of U_q(gl_n)-modules by continuation from finite dimensional representations. Each such module is associated with a combinatorial object - admissible set of relations defined in \cite{FRZ}. More precisely, we prove that any admissible set of relations leads to a family of irreducible U_q(gl_n)-modules. Finite dimensional and generic modules are particular cases of this construction.
