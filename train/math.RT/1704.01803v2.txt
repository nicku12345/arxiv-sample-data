Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p\geqslant 0 and let W be a finite-dimensional K-space of dimension greater than or equal to 5. In this paper, we give the structure of certain Weyl modules for G=\mbox{Spin}(W) in the case where p\neq 2, as well as the dimension of the corresponding irreducible, finite-dimensional, rational KG-modules. In addition, we determine the composition factors of the restriction of certain irreducible, finite-dimensional, rational K\mbox{SL}(W)-modules to \mbox{SO}(W).
