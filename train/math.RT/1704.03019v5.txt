Let G be a split reductive p-adic group. Let {\mathcal H}(G) be its Hecke algebra and let {\mathcal C}(G)\supset {\mathcal H}(G) be the Harish-Chandra Schwartz algebra. The purpose of this note is to give a spectral interpretation of Lusztig's asymptotic Hecke algebra J (which contains the Iwahori part of {\mathcal H}(G) as a subalgebra), which shows that J is a subalgebra of {\mathcal C} (G). This spectral description also allows to define a version of J beyond the Iwahori component - i.e. we define certain subalgebra {\mathcal J}(G) of {\mathcal C}(G) which contains {\mathcal H}(G). We explain a relation between {\mathcal J}(G) and the Schwartz space of the basic affine space studied by us about 20 years ago.
