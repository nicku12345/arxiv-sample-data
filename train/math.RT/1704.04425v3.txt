We generalize Regev's result on a virtual character of S_n. Suppose that \lambda and \mu are integer partitions of n. For the associated irreducible character \chi^\lambda of S_n, when \chi^\lambda(\mu)\neq0 we find another partition \tau related to \lambda such that \chi^\tau(\mu)\neq0 by the virtual character. Applying this result, we obtain a class of nonzero Kronecker coefficients by Pak et al.'s character criterion. Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of Pak et al.'s character criterion by a concrete example.
