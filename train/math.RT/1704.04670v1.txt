W.E. Roth (1952) proved that the matrix equation AX-XB=C has a solution if and only if the matrices \left[\begin{matrix}A&C\\0&B\end{matrix}\right] and \left[\begin{matrix}A&0\\0&B\end{matrix}\right] are similar. A. Dmytryshyn and B. K{\aa}gstr\"om (2015) extended Roth's criterion to systems of matrix equations A_iX_{i'}M_i-N_iX_{i''}^{\sigma_i} B_i=C_i (i=1,\dots,s) with unknown matrices X_1,\dots,X_t, in which every X^{\sigma} is X, X^T, or X^*. We extend their criterion to systems of complex matrix equations that include the complex conjugation of unknown matrices. We also prove an analogous criterion for systems of quaternion matrix equations.
