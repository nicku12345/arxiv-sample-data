This article is part of a project which aims to describe as explicitly as possible the Arthur packets of classical real groups and to prove a multiplicity one result for them. Let G be a symplectic or special orthogonal real group, and \psi: W_{\mathbb R}\times \mathbf{SL}_2(\mathbb C)\rightarrow {}^LG be an Arthur parameter for G. Let A(\psi) the component group of the centralizer of \psi in \hat G. Attached to \psi is a finite length unitary representation \pi^A(\psi) of G\times A(\psi), which is characterized by the endoscopic identities (ordinary and twisted) it satisfies.   In [arXiv:1703.07226] we gave a description of the irreducible components of \pi^A(\psi) when the parameter \psi is "very regular, with good parity". In the present paper, we use translation of infinitesimal character to describe \pi^A(\psi) in the general good parity case from the representation \pi^A(\psi_+) attached to a very regular, with good parity, parameter \psi_+ obtained from \psi by a simple shift.
