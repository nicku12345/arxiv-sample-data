In this article, we determine cocycle deformations and Galois objects of non-commutative and non-cocommutative semisimple Hopf algebras of dimension 16. We show that these Hopf algebras are pairwise twist inequivalent mainly by calculating their higher Frobenius-Schur indicators, and that except three Hopf algebras which are cocycle deformations of dual group algebras, none of them admit non-trivial cocycle deformations.
