The notion of n-th indicator for a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra was introduced by Kashina, Montgomery and Ng as gauge invariance of the monoidal category of its representations. The properties of these indicators were further investigated by Shimizu. In this short note, we show that the indicators appearing in positive characteristic all share the same sequence pattern if we assume the coradical of the Hopf algebra is a local Hopf subalgebra.
