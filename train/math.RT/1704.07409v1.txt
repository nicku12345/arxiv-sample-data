These are the notes for a minicourse held in Odessa (2016) and Belo Horizonte (2017). My aim was to provide a short introduction to basic notions of category theory and representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras. We learnt the concept of adjoint functors and showed that the construction "quiver" <-> "algebra" can be interpreted as a pair of adjoint functors between certain categories. Lectures almost do not contain the proofs, theoretical part is accompanied with examples, and sometimes introduced in the form of exercises.
