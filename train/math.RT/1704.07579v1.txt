Let G be a finite symmetric, general linear, or general unitary group defined over a field of characteristic coprime to 3. We construct a canonical correspondence between irreducible characters of degree coprime to 3 of G and those of N_{G}(P), where P is a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since our bijections commute with the action of the absolute Galois group over the rationals, we conclude that fields of values of character correspondents are the same.
