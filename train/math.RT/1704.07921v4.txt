We realize a family of generalized cluster algebras as Caldero-Chapoton algebras of quivers with relations. Each member of this family arises from an unpunctured polygon with one orbifold point of order 3, and is realized as a Caldero-Chapoton algebra of a quiver with relations naturally associated to any triangulation of the alluded polygon. The realization is done by defining for every arc j on the polygon with orbifold point a representation M(j) of the referred quiver with relations, and by proving that for every triangulation \tau and every arc j\in\tau, the product of the Caldero-Chapoton functions of M(j) and M(j'), where j' is the arc that replaces j when we flip j in \tau, equals the corresponding exchange polynomial of Chekhov-Shapiro in the generalized cluster algebra. Furthermore, we show that there is a bijection between the set of generalized cluster variables and the isomorphism classes of E-rigid indecomposable decorated representations of \Lambda.
