We revisit the construction of higher spin representations by Kleinschmidt and Nicolai for E10, generalize it to arbitrary simply laced types, and provide a coordinate-free approach to the 3/2-spin and 5/2-spin representations. Moreover, we discuss the relationship between our findings and the representation theory of Sym(3) pointed out to us by Levy.
