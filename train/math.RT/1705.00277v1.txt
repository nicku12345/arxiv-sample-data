We introduce the symmetric (respectively, non-symmetric) \tau_{-\ell}-hypergeometric functions associated with a root system of type BC as joint eigenfunctions of a commutative algebra of differential (respectively, differential-reflection) operators. Under certain conditions on the real parameter \ell, we derive their properties (positivity, estimates, asymptotics and boundedness) by establishing the analogous properties for the Heckman-Opdam (symmetric and non-symmetric) hypergeometric functions corresponding to (not necessarily positive) multiplicity functions which are standard.
