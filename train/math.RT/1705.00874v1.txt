For a symmetric R-space K/L=G/P the standard intertwining operators provide a canonical G-invariant pairing between sections of line bundles over G/P and its opposite G/\overline{P}. Twisting this pairing with an involution of G which defines a non-compactly causal symmetric space G/H we obtain an H-invariant form on sections of line bundles over G/P. Restricting to the open H-orbits in G/P constructs the Berezin forms studied previously by G. van Dijk, S. C. Hille and V. F. Molchanov. We determine for which H-orbits in G/P and for which line bundles the Berezin form is positive semidefinite, and in this case identify the corresponding representations of the dual group G^c as unitary highest weight representations. We further relate this procedure of passing from representations of G to representations of G^c to reflection positivity.
