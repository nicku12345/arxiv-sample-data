We give a characterization of n-cluster tilting subcategories of representation-directed algebras based on the n-Auslander-Reiten translations. As an application we classify acyclic Nakayama algebras with homogeneous relations which admit an n-cluster tilting subcategory. Finally, we classify Nakayama algebras of global dimension d<\infty which admit a d-cluster tilting subcategory.
