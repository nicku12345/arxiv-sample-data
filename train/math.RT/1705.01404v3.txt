We review Morita equivalence for finite type k-algebras A and also a weakening of Morita equivalence which we call stratified equivalence. The spectrum of A is the set of equivalence classes of irreducible A-modules. For any finite type k-algebra A, the spectrum of A is in bijection with the set of primitive ideals of A. The stratified equivalence relation preserves the spectrum of A and also preserves the periodic cyclic homology of A. However, the stratified equivalence relation permits a tearing apart of strata in the primitive ideal space which is not allowed by Morita equivalence. A key example illustrating the distinction between Morita equivalence and stratified equivalence is provided by affine Hecke algebras associated to extended affine Weyl groups.
