In this paper, we prove the local converse theorem for \textrm{Sp}_{2r}(F) over a p-adic field F. More precisely, given two irreducible supercuspidal representations of \textrm{Sp}_{2r}(F) with the same central character such that they are generic with the same additive character and they have the same gamma factors when twisted with generic irreducible representations of \textrm{GL}_n(F) for all 1\le n\le r, then these two representations must be isomorphic. Our proof is based on the local analysis of the local integrals which define local gamma factors. A key ingredient of the proof is certain partial Bessel function property developed by Cogdell-Shahidi-Tsai recently. The same method can give the local converse theorem for \textrm{U}(r,r).
