Let G^{(r)} denote the metaplectic covering group of the linear algebraic group G. In this paper we study conditions on unramified representations of the group G^{(r)} not to have a nonzero Whittaker function. We state a general Conjecture about the possible unramified characters \chi such that the unramified sub-representation of Ind_{B^{(r)}}^{G^{(r)}}\chi\delta_B^{1/2} will have no nonzero Whittaker function. We prove this Conjecture for the groups GL_n^{(r)} with r\ge n-1, and for the exceptional groups G_2^{(r)} when r\ne 2.
