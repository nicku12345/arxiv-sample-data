The coadjoint representation of a connected algebraic group Q with Lie algebra \mathfrak q is a thrilling and fascinating object. Symmetric invariants of \mathfrak q (= \mathfrak q-invariants in the symmetric algebra S(\mathfrak q)) can be considered as a first approximation to the understanding of the coadjoint action (Q:\mathfrak q^*) and coadjoint orbits. In this article, we study a class of non-reductive Lie algebras, where the description of the symmetric invariants is possible and the coadjoint representation has a number of nice invariant-theoretic properties. If G is a semisimple group with Lie algebra \mathfrak g and V is G-module, then we define \mathfrak q to be the semi-direct product of \mathfrak g and V. Then we are interested in the case, where the generic isotropy group for the G-action on V is reductive and commutative. It turns out that in this case symmetric invariants of \mathfrak q can be constructed via certain G-equivariant maps from \mathfrak g to V ("covariants").
