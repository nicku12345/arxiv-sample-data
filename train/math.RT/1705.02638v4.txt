Let G be a connected reductive group over a non-archimedean local field F of residue characteristic p, P be a parabolic subgroup of G, and R be a commutative ring. When R is artinian, p is nilpotent in R, and \mathrm{char}(F)=p, we prove that the ordinary part functor \mathrm{Ord}_P is exact on the category of admissible smooth R-representations of G. We derive some results on Yoneda extensions between admissible smooth R-representations of G.
