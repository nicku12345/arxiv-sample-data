We associate a monoidal category \mathcal{H}^\lambda to each dominant integral weight \lambda of \widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_p or \mathfrak{sl}_\infty. These categories, defined in terms of planar diagrams, act naturally on categories of modules for the degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebras associated to \lambda. We show that, in the \mathfrak{sl}_\infty case, the level d Heisenberg algebra embeds into the Grothendieck ring of \mathcal{H}^\lambda, where d is the level of \lambda. The categories \mathcal{H}^\lambda can be viewed as a graphical calculus describing induction and restriction functors between categories of modules for degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebras, together with their natural transformations. As an application of this tool, we prove a new result concerning centralizers for degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebras.
