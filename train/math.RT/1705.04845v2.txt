This paper is the continuation of \cite{CXY}. Let {\bf G} be a simply connected semisimple algebraic group over \Bbbk=\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q, the algebraically closure of \mathbb{F}_q (the finite field with q=p^e elements), and F be the standard Frobenius map. Let {\bf B} be an F-stable Borel subgroup and {\bf T} an F-stable maximal torus contained in {\bf B}. This paper studies the original induced module \op{Ind}_{\bf B}^{\bf G}\lambda=\Bbbk{\bf G}\otimes_{\Bbbk{\bf B}}\lambda (here \Bbbk{\bf H} is the group algebra of the group {\bf H}, and \lambda is a rational character of {\bf T} regarded as a {\bf B}-module). We show that if \lambda is antidominant and not trivial, then certain submodule of \op{Ind}_{\bf B}^{\bf G}\lambda is irreducible and non quasi-finite.
