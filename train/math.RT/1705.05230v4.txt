Let \mathbf{k} be a field of arbitrary characteristic, let \Lambda be a finite dimensional \mathbf{k}-algebra, and let V be a finitely generated \Lambda-module. F. M. Bleher and the third author previously proved that V has a well-defined versal deformation ring R(\Lambda,V). If the stable endomorphism ring of V is isomorphic to \mathbf{k}, they also proved under the additional assumption that \Lambda is self-injective that R(\Lambda,V) is universal. In this paper, we prove instead that if \Lambda is arbitrary but V is Gorenstein-projective then R(\Lambda,V) is also universal when the stable endomorphism ring of V is isomorphic to \mathbf{k}. Moreover, we show that singular equivalences of Morita type (as introduced by X. W. Chen and L. G. Sun) preserve the isomorphism classes of versal deformation rings of finitely generated Gorenstein-projective modules over Gorenstein algebras. We also provide examples. In particular, if \Lambda is a monomial algebra in which there is no overlap (as introduced by X. W. Chen, D. Shen and G. Zhou) we prove that every finitely generated indecomposable Gorenstein-projective \Lambda-module has a universal deformation ring that is isomorphic to either \mathbf{k} or to \mathbf{k}[\![t]\!]/(t^2).
