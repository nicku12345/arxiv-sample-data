We study {\mathbb Z}-graded thread W^+-modules V=\oplus_i V_i, \; \dim{V_i}=1, -\infty \le k< i < N\le +\infty, \; \dim{V_i}=0, \; {\rm \; otherwise}, over the positive part W^+ of the Witt (Virasoro) algebra W. There is well-known example of infinite-dimensional (k=-\infty, N=\infty) two-parametric family V_{\lambda, \mu} of W^+-modules induced by the twisted W-action on tensor densities P(x)x^{\mu}(dx)^{-\lambda}, \mu, \lambda \in {\mathbb K}, P(x) \in {\mathbb K}[t]. Another family C_{\alpha, \beta} of W^+-modules is defined by the action of two multiplicative generators e_1, e_2 of W^+ as e_1f_i=\alpha f_{i+1} and e_2f_j=\beta f_{j+2} for i,j \in {\mathbb Z} and \alpha, \beta are two arbitrary constants (e_if_j=0, i \ge 3).   We classify (n+1)-dimensional graded thread W^+-modules for n sufficiently large n of three important types. New examples of graded thread W^+-modules different from finite-dimensional quotients of V_{\lambda, \mu} and C_{\alpha, \beta} were found.
