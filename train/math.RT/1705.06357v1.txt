The aim of this work is to study the representation dimension of cluster tilted algebras. We prove that the weak representation dimension of tame cluster tilted algebras is equal to three. We construct a generator module that reaches the weak representation dimension, unfortunately this module is not always a cogenerator. We show for which algebras this module gives the representation dimension.
