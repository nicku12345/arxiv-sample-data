In this paper we will derive an explicit description of the genuine projective representations of the symmetric group S_n using Dirac cohomology and the branching graph for the irreducible genuine projective representations of S_n. In 2015 Ciubotaru and He, using the extended Dirac index, showed that the characters of the projective representations of S_n are related to the characters of elliptic graded modules. We derived the branching graph using Dirac theory and combinatorics relating to the cohomology of Borel varieties \mathcal{B}_e of \mathfrak{g} and were able to use Dirac cohomology to construct an explicit model for the projective representations. We also described Vogan's morphism for Hecke algebras in type A using spectrum data of the Jucys-Murphy elements.
