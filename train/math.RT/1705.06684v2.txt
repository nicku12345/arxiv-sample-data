Auslander-Reiten duality for module categories is generalized to some sufficiently nice subcategories. In particular, our consideration works for \mathcal{P}^{<\infty}(\Lambda), the subcategory consisting of finitely generated modules with finite projective dimension over an artin algebra \Lambda, and also, the subcategory of Gorenstein projectove modules of \rm{mod}\mbox{-}\Lambda, denoted by \rm{Gprj}\mbox{-}\Lambda. In this paper, we give a method to compute the Auslander-Reiten translation in \mathcal{P}^{<\infty}(\Lambda) whenever \Lambda is a 1-Gorenstein algebra. In addition, we characterize when the Auslander-Reiten translation in \rm{Gprj}\mbox{-}\Lambda is the first syzygy and provide many algebras having such property.
