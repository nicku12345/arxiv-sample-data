For an affine algebraic variety X we study a category of modules that admit compatible actions of both the algebra of functions on X and the Lie algebra of vector fields on X. In particular, for the case when X is the sphere \mathbb{S}^2, we construct a set of simple modules that are finitely generated over A. In addition, we prove that the monoidal category that these modules generate is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional rational \mathrm{GL}_2-modules.
