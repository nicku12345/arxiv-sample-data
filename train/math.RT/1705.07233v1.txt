Let A be the one point extension of an algebra B by a projective B-module. We prove that the extension of a given support \tau-tilting B-module is a support \tau-tilting A-module; and, conversely, the restriction of a given support \tau-tilting A-module is a support \tau-tilting B-module. Moreover, we prove that there exists a full embedding of quivers between the corresponding poset of support \tau-tilting modules.
