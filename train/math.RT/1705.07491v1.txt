We consider the cohomological Hall algebra Y of a Lagrangian substack of the moduli stack of representations of the preprojective algebra of an arbitrary quiver Q, and its actions on the cohomology of quiver varieties. We conjecture that Y is equal, after a suitable extension of scalars, to the Yangian introduced by Maulik and Okounkov, and we construct an embedding of Y in the Yangian, intertwining the respective actions of both algebras on the cohomology of quiver varieties.
