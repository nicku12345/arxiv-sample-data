For an arbitrary finite dimensional algebra \Lambda, we prove that any wide subcategory of \mathsf{mod} \Lambda satisfying a certain finiteness condition is \theta-semistable for some stability condition \theta. More generally, we show that wide subcategories of \mathsf{mod} \Lambda associated with two-term presilting complexes of \Lambda are semistable. This provides a complement for Ingalls-Thomas-type bijections for finite dimensional algebras.
