Let E/F be a quadratic extension of p-adic fields and \textrm{U}_{2r+1} be the unitary group associated with E/F. We prove the following local converse theorem for \textrm{U}_{2r+1}: given two irreducible generic supercuspidal representations \pi,\pi_0 of \textrm{U}_{2r+1} with the same central character, if \gamma(s,\pi\times \tau,\psi)=\gamma(s,\pi_0\times \tau,\psi) for all irreducible generic representation \tau of \textrm{GL}_n(E) and for all n with 1\le n\le r, then \pi\cong \pi_0. The proof depends on analysis of the local integrals which define local gamma factors and uses certain properties of partial Bessel functions developed by Cogdell-Shahidi-Tsai recently.
