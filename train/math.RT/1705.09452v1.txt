In paper, we study the representation theory of super W(2,2) algebra {\mathfrak{L}}. We prove that {\mathfrak{L}} has no mixed irreducible modules and give the classification of irreducible modules of intermediate series. We determinate the conjugate-linear anti-involution of {\mathfrak{L}} and give the unitary modules of intermediate series.
