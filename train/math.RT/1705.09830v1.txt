The paper is devoted to the investigation of uniform notion for acts over semigroups perceived as an overclass of subdirectly irreducible acts. We establish conditions to fill the gap between these classes of acts. Besides we prove that uniform acts with two zeros are subdirectly irreducible. Ultimately we investigate monoids which are uniform as right acts over themselves and we characterize regular ones.
