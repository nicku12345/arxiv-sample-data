Let \mathfrak{g} be a simple Lie algebra of exceptional type over an algebraically closed field k, and let G be a simple linear algebraic group with Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. For \mathrm{char} \, k =p >0, we present a complete classification of the G-conjugacy classes of balanced toral elements of \mathfrak{g}. As a result, we also obtain the classification of conjugacy classes of balanced inner torsion automorphisms of \mathfrak{g} of order p when \mathrm{char} \, k =0.
