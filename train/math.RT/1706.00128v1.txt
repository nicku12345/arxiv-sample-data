The paper is devoted to a computation of the Lie superalgebras of holomorphic vector fields on isotropic flag supermanifolds of maximal type corresponding to the Lie superalgebras \mathfrak{osp}_{2m|2n}(\mathbb C) and \pi\mathfrak{sp}_{n}(\mathbb C). The result is that under some restrictions on the flag type any holomorphic vector field is fundamental with respect to the natural action of the Lie superalgebras \mathfrak{osp}_{2m|2n}(\mathbb C) or \pi\mathfrak{sp}_{n}(\mathbb C).
