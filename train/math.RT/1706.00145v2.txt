We use the theory of Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases for ideals to construct linear bases for graded local Weyl modules for the (hyper) current and the truncated current algebras associated to the finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{sl}_2. The main result is a characteristic-free construction of bases for this important family of modules for the hyper current \mathfrak{sl}_2-algebra. In the positive characteristic setting this work represents the first construction in the literature. In the characteristic zero setting, the method provides a different construction of the Chari-Pressley (also Kus-Littelmann) bases and the Chari-Venkatesh bases for local Weyl modules for the current \mathfrak{sl}_2-algebra. Our construction allows us to obtain new bases for the local Weyl modules for truncated current \mathfrak{sl}_2-algebras with very particular properties.
