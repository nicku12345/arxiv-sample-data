We establish a character formula for indecomposable tilting modules for connected reductive groups in characteristic p in terms of p-Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, for p>h the Coxeter number. Using results of Andersen, one may deduce a character formula for simple modules if p>2h-3. Our results are a consequence of an extension to modular coefficients of a monoidal Koszul duality equivalence established by Bezrukavnikov and Yun.
