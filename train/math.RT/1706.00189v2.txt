Let \mathfrak g be a simple Lie algebra with Cartan subalgebra \mathfrak h and Weyl group W. We build up a graded map (\mathcal H\otimes \bigwedge\mathfrak h\otimes \mathfrak h)^W\to (\bigwedge \mathfrak g\otimes \mathfrak g)^\mathfrak g of   (\bigwedge \mathfrak g)^\mathfrak g\cong S(\mathfrak h)^W-modules, where \mathcal H is the space of W-harmonics. In this way we prove an enhanced form of a conjecture of Reeder for the adjoint representation.   New version with different title. Various improvements. New section 7.
