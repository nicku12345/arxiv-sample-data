Let F be a non-archimedean local field of odd residue characteristic p. Let G be the unramified unitary group U(2, 1)(E/F), and K be a maximal compact open subgroup of G. For an \overline{\mathbf{F}}_p-smooth representation \pi of G containing a weight \sigma of K, we follow the work of Hu (\cite{Hu12}) to attach \pi a certain I_K-subrepresentation, where I_K is the Iwahori subgroup in K. In terms of such an I_K-subrepresentation, we prove a sufficient condition for \pi to be non-finitely presented. We determine such an I_K-subrepresentation explicitly, when \pi is either a spherical universal Hecke module or an irreducible principal series.
