Let G be a split Kac-Moody group over a non-archimedean local field. We define a completion of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of G. We determine its center and prove that it is isomorphic to the spherical Hecke algebra of G using the Satake isomorphism. This is thus similar to the situation of reductive groups. Our main tool is the masure I associated to this setting, which is the analogue of the Bruhat-Tits building for reductive groups. Then, for each special and spherical facet F, we associate a Hecke algebra. In the Kac-Moody setting, this construction was known only for the spherical subgroup and for the Iwahori subgroup.
