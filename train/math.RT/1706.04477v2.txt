We introduce and study the higher tetrahedral algebras, an exotic family of finite-dimensional tame symmetric algebras over an algebraically closed field. The Gabriel quiver of such an algebra is the triangulation quiver associated to the coherent orientation of the tetrahedron. Surprisingly, these algebras occurred in the classification of all algebras of generalised quaternion type, but are not weighted surface algebras. We prove that a higher tetrahedral algebra is periodic if and only if it is non-singular.
