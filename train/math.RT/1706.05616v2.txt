For a connected semisimple Lie group G we describe an explicit collection of correspondences between the admissible dual of G and the admissible dual of the Cartan motion group associated with G. We conjecture that each of these correspondences induces an algebraic isomorphism between the admissible duals. The constructed correspondences are defined in terms of algebraic families of Harish-Chandra modules. We prove that the conjecture holds in the case of SL_2(\mathbb{R}), and in that case we give an equivalent characterization for the bijections.
