This text is a response to the following question: What are the methods to build supercuspidal complex representations of p-adic reductive groups and are there ties between them ? We will give an overview of the Bushnell-Kutzko and Yu constructions. Then, given a simple maximum tame stratum, a simple character \theta associated to this stratum and a representation of the level zero of a subset of G, we associate a Yu data generic and therefore a representation constructed by Yu, this representation corresponds to a simple type given by a \beta - extension of \theta.
