The purpose of my Ph.D. research is to define and study an analogue of the classical Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) category \mathcal{O} for the Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}, where \mathfrak{g} is one of the finitary, infinite-dimensional Lie algebras \mathfrak{gl}_\infty(\mathbb{K}), \mathfrak{sl}_\infty(\mathbb{K}), \mathfrak{so}_\infty(\mathbb{K}), and \mathfrak{sp}_\infty(\mathbb{K}). Here, \mathbb{K} is an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. We call these categories "extended categories \mathcal{O}" and use the notation \bar{\mathcal{O}}. While the categories \bar{\mathcal{O}} are defined for all splitting Borel subalgebras of \mathfrak{g}, this research focuses on the categories \bar{\mathcal{O}} for very special Borel subalgebras of \mathfrak{g} which we call Dynkin Borel subalgebras. Some results concerning block decomposition and Kazhdan-Lusztig multiplicities carry over from usual categories \mathcal{O} to our categories \bar{\mathcal{O}}. There are differences which we shall explore in detail, such as the lack of some injective hulls. In this connection, we study truncated categories \bar{\mathcal{O}} and are able to establish an analogue of BGG reciprocity in the categories \bar{\mathcal{O}}.
