Let G be a connected, simply connected nilpotent group and \pi be a square-integrable irreducible unitary representation modulo its center Z(G) on L^2(\mathbf{R}^d). We prove that under reasonably weak conditions on G and \pi there exist a discrete subset \Gamma of G/Z(G) and some (relatively) compact set F \subseteq \mathbf{R}^d such that   \bigl \{ |F|^{-1/2} \hspace{2pt} \pi(\gamma) 1_F \mid \gamma \in \Gamma \bigr\} forms an orthonormal basis of L^2(\mathbf{R}^d). This construction generalizes the well-known example of Gabor orthonormal bases in time-frequency analysis.   The main theorem covers graded Lie groups with one-dimensional center. In the presence of a rational structure, the set \Gamma  can be chosen to be a uniform subgroup of G/Z.
