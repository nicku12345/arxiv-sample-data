We formulate and study the spin nilHecke algebras {}^\mathfrak{b}\!{\mathrm{NH}}_n^- and {}^\mathfrak{d}\!{\mathrm{NH}}_n^- of type B/D, which differ from the usual nilHecke algebras by some odd signs. The type B spin nilHecke algebra is a nil version of the spin type B Hecke algebra introduced earlier by the second author and Khongsap, but not for the type D one. We construct faithful polynomial representations \mathrm{Pol}_n^- of the nilHecke algebras via odd Demazure operators. We formulate the spin Schubert polynomials, and use them to show that the spin nilHecke algebras are matrix algebras with entries in a subalgebra of \mathrm{Pol}_n^- consisting of spin symmetric polynomials. All these results have their counterparts for the usual nilHecke algebras over the rational field. Our work is a generalization of results of Lauda and Ellis-Khovanov-Lauda in usual/spin type A.
