We show that, for any cluster-tilted algebra of finite representation type over an algebraically closed field, the following three definitions of a maximal green sequence are equivalent: (1) the usual definition in terms of Fomin-Zelevinsky mutation of the extended exchange matrix, (2) a forward hom-orthogonal sequence of Schurian modules, (3) the sequence of wall crossings of a generic green path. Together with [24], this completes the foundational work needed to support the author's work with P.J. Apruzzese [1], namely, to determine all lengths of all maximal green sequences for all quivers whose underlying graph is an oriented or unoriented cycle and to determine which are "linear".   In an Appendix, written jointly with G. Todorov, we give a conjectural description of maximal green sequences of maximum length for any cluster-tilted algebra of finite representation type.
