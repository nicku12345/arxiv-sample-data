We study different concepts of stability for modules over a finite dimensional algebra: linear stability, given by a "central charge", and nonlinear stability given by the wall-crossing sequence of a "green path". Two other concepts, finite Harder-Narasimhan stratification of the module category and maximal forward hom-orthogonal sequences of Schurian modules, which are always equivalent to each other, are shown to be equivalent to nonlinear stability and to a maximal green sequence, defined using Fomin-Zelevinsky quiver mutation, in the case the algebra is hereditary.   This is the first of a series of three papers whose purpose is to determine all maximal green sequences of maximal length for quivers of affine type \tilde A and determine which are linear. The complete answer will be given in the final paper [1].
