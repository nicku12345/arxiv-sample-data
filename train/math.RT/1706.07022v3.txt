We show that the irreducible components of any moduli space of semistable representations of a special biserial algebra are always isomorphic to products of projective spaces of various dimensions. This is done by showing that irreducible components of varieties of representations of special biserial algebras are isomorphic to irreducible components of products of varieties of circular complexes, and therefore normal, allowing us to apply recent results of the second and third authors on moduli spaces.
