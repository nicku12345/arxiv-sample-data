We introduce the notion of interlaced weak ditalgebras and apply reduction procedures to their module categories to prove the tame-wild dichotomy for the category {\cal F}(\Delta) of filtered by standard modules for a quasi-hereditary algebra. Moreover, in the tame case, we show that given a fixed dimension d, for every d-dimensional indecomposable module M \in {\cal F}(\Delta), with the only possible exception of those lying in a finite number of isomorphism classes, the module M coincides with its Auslander-Reiten translate in {\cal F}(\Delta). Our results are based on a theorem by Koenig, K\"ulshammer, and Ovsienko relating {\cal F}(\Delta) with the module category of some special type of ditalgebra.
