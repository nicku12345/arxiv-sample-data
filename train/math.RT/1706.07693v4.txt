We prove that the class of Brauer graph algebras coincides with the class of indecomposable idempotent algebras of biserial weighted surface algebras. These algebras are associated to triangulated surfaces with arbitrarily oriented triangles, investigated in [17] and [18]. Moreover we prove that Brauer graph algebras are idempotent algebras of periodic weighted surface algebras, investigated in [17] and [19].
