We call the \emph{p-fundamental string} of a complex simple Lie algebra to the sequence of irreducible representations having highest weights of the form k\omega_1+\omega_p for k\geq0, where \omega_j denotes the j-th fundamental weight of the associated root system. For a classical complex Lie algebra, we establish a closed explicit formula for the weight multiplicities of any representation in any p-fundamental string.
