We prove a character formula for the irreducible modules from the category \mathcal{O} over the simple affine vertex algebra of type A_n and C_n (n \geq 2) of level k=-1. We also give a conjectured character formula for types D_4, E_6, E_7, E_8 and levels k=-1, \cdots, -b, where b=2,3,4,6 respectively.
