A complex vector space V is an \'etale G-module if G acts rationally on V with a Zariski-open orbit and \dim G=\dim V. Such a module is called super-\'etale if the stabilizer of a point in the open orbit is trivial. Popov proved that reductive algebraic groups admitting super-\'etale modules are special algebraic groups. He further conjectured that a reductive group admitting a super-\'etale module is always isomorphic to a product of general linear groups. In light of previously available examples, one can conjecture more generally that in such a group all simple factors are either SL_n for some n or Sp_2. We show that this is not the case by constructing a family of super-\'etale modules for groups with a factor Sp_n for arbitrary n\geq1. A similar construction provides a family of \'etale modules for groups with a factor SO_n, which shows that groups with \'etale modules with non-trivial stabilizer are not necessarily special. Both families of examples are somewhat surprising in light of the previously known examples of \'etale and super-\'etale modules for reductive groups. Finally, we show that the exceptional groups F_4 and E_8 cannot appear as simple factors in the maximal semisimple subgroup of an arbitrary Lie group with a linear \'etale representation.
