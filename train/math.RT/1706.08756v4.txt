We study a finite-dimensional algebra \Lambda constructed from a Postnikov diagram D in a disk, obtained from the dimer algebra of Baur-King-Marsh by factoring out the ideal generated by the boundary idempotent. Thus \Lambda is isomorphic to the stable endomorphism algebra of the cluster tilting module T\in\underline{\operatorname{CM}}(B) introduced by Jensen-King-Su in order to categorify the cluster algebra structure of \mathbb C[\operatorname{Gr}_k(\mathbb C^n)]. We show that \Lambda is self-injective if and only if D has a certain rotational symmetry. In this case, \Lambda is the Jacobian algebra of a self-injective quiver with potential, which implies that its truncated Jacobian algebras in the sense of Herschend-Iyama are 2-representation finite. We study cuts and mutations of such quivers with potential leading to some new 2-representation finite algebras.
