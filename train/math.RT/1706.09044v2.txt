It is well-known that the Harish-Chandra transform, f\mapsto\mathcal{H}f, is a topological isomorphism of the spherical (Schwartz) convolution algebra \mathcal{C}^{p}(G//K) (where K is a maximal compact subgroup of any arbitrarily chosen group G in the Harish-Chandra class and 0<p\leq2) onto the (Schwartz) multiplication algebra \bar{\mathcal{Z}}({\mathfrak{F}}^{\epsilon}) (of \mathfrak{w}-invariant members of \mathcal{Z}({\mathfrak{F}}^{\epsilon}), with \epsilon=(2/p)-1). The same cannot however be said of the full Schwartz convolution algebra \mathcal{C}^{p}(G), except for few specific examples of groups (notably G=SL(2,\mathbb{R})) and for some notable values of p (with restrictions on G and/or on \mathcal{C}^{p}(G)). Nevertheless the full Harish-Chandra Plancherel formula on G is known for all of \mathcal{C}^{2}(G)=:\mathcal{C}(G). In order to then understand the structure of Harish-Chandra transform more clearly and to compute the image of \mathcal{C}^{p}(G) under it (without any restriction) we derive an absolutely convergent series expansion (in terms of known functions) for the Harish-Chandra transform by an application of the full Plancherel formula on G. This leads to a computation of the image of \mathcal{C}(G) under the Harish-Chandra transform which may be seen as a concrete realization of Arthur's result and be easily extended to all of \mathcal{C}^{p}(G) in much the same way as it is known in the work of Trombi and Varadarajan.
