We give the exact contributions of Harish-Chandra transform, (\mathcal{H}f)(\lambda), of Schwartz functions f to the harmonic analysis of spherical convolutions and the corresponding L^{p}- Schwartz algebras on a connected semisimple Lie group G (with finite center). One of our major results gives the proof of how the Trombi-Varadarajan Theorem enters into the spherical convolution transform of L^{p}- Schwartz functions.
