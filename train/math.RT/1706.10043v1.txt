Let n\geq 3, and let Y be a simply connected, simple algebraic group of type D_{n+1} over an algebraically closed field K. Also let X be the subgroup of type B_n of Y, embedded in the usual way. In this paper, we correct an error in a proof of a theorem of Seitz, resulting in the discovery of a new family of triples (X,Y,V), where V denotes a finite-dimensional, irreducible, rational KY-module, on which X acts irreducibly. We go on to investigate the impact of the existence of the new examples on the classification of the maximal closed connected subgroups of the classical algebraic groups.
