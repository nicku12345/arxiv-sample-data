We use the dimension and the Lie algebra structure of the first Hochschild cohomology group to distinguish some algebras of dihedral, semi-dihedral and quaternion type up to stable equivalence of Morita type. In particular, we complete the classification of algebras of dihedral type that was mostly determined by Zhou and Zimmermann.
