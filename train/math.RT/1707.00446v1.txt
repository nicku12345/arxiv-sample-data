Let G be a connected simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0, and g := Lie(G). We additionally assume that G is standard and is of type An. Motivated by the investigation of the geometric properties of the varieties E(r, g) of r-dimensional elementary subalgebras of a restricted Lie algebra g, we will show in this article the irreducible components of E(rkp(g)-1,g) when rkp(g) is the maximal dimension of an elementary subalgebra of g.
