Brundan, Kleshchev and Wang equip the Specht modules S_{\lambda} over the cyclotomic Khovanov--Lauda--Rouquier algebra \mathscr{H}_n^{\Lambda} with a homogeneous \mathbb{Z}-graded basis. In this paper we begin the study of graded Specht modules labelled by hook bipartitions ((n-m),(1^m)) in level 2 of \mathscr{H}_n^{\Lambda}, which are precisely the Hecke algebras of type B, with quantum characteristic at least three. We give an explicit description of the action of the Khovanov--Lauda--Rouquier algebra generators \psi_1,\dots,\psi_{n-1} on the basis elements of S_{((n-m),(1^m))}. Introducing certain Specht module homomorphisms, we construct irreducible submodules of these Specht modules, and thereby completely determining the composition series of Specht modules labelled by hook bipartitions for e\geqslant{3}.
