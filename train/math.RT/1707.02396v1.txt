The purpose of this paper is to construct new families of irreducible Gelfand-Tsetlin modules for U_q(gl_n). These modules have arbitrary singularity and Gelfand-Tsetlin multiplicities bounded by 2. Most previously known irreducible modules had all Gelfand-Tsetlin multiplicities bounded by 1 \cite{FRZ1}, \cite{FRZ2}. In particular, our method works for q=1 providing new families of irreducible Gelfand-Tsetlin modules for gl_n. This generalizes the results of \cite{FGR3} and \cite{FRZ}.
