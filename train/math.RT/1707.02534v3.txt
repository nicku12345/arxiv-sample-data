Let n\in\mathbb{N} and K be any field. For any symmetric generalized Cartan matrix A, any \beta in the positive root lattice with height n and any integral dominant weight \Lambda, one can associate a quiver Hecke algebras R_{\beta}(K) and its cyclotomic quotient R_{\beta}^{\Lambda}(K) over K. It has been conjectured that the natural map from R_{\beta}(K) to R_{\beta}^{\Lambda}(K) maps the center of R_{\beta}(K) surjectively onto the center of R_{\beta}^{\Lambda}(K). A similar conjecture claims that the center of the affine Hecke algebra of type A maps surjectively onto the center of its cyclotomic quotient---the cyclotomic Hecke algebra H_n^{\Lambda} of type G(\ell,1,n) over K. In this paper, we prove these two conjectures affirmatively. As a consequence, we show that the center of H_n^{\Lambda} is stable under base change and it has dimension equal to the number of \ell-partitions of n. Finally, as a byproduct, we also verify a conjecture of Shan, Varagnolo and Vasserot on the grading structure of the center of R_{\beta}^{\Lambda}(K).
