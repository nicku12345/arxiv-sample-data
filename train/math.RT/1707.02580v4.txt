Let (\mathfrak{g},[p]) be a restricted Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p\!\ge \!3. Motivated by the behavior of geometric invariants of the so-called (\mathfrak{g},[p])-modules of constant j-rank (j \in \{1,\ldots,p\!-\!1\}), we study the projective variety \mathbb{E}(2,\mathfrak{g}) of two-dimensional elementary abelian subalgebras. If p\!\ge\!5, then the topological space \mathbb{E}(2,\mathfrak{g}/C(\mathfrak{g})), associated to the factor algebra of \mathfrak{g} by its center C(\mathfrak{g}), is shown to be connected. We give applications concerning categories of (\mathfrak{g},[p])-modules of constant j-rank and certain invariants, called j-degrees.
