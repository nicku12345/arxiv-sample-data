Let {\bf G} be a connected reductive group over \bar{\mathbb{F}}_q, the algebraically closure of \mathbb{F}_q (the finite field with q=p^e elements), with the standard Frobenius map F. Let {\bf B} be an F-stable Borel subgroup. Let \Bbbk be a field of characteristic r\neq p. In this paper, we completely determine the composition factors of the induced module Ind_{B}^{G}{tr}=\Bbbk{G}\otimes_{\Bbbk{\bf B}} tr (here \Bbbk{H} is the group algebra of the group {H}, and tr is the trivial B-module). In particular, we find a new family of infinite dimensional irreducible abstract representations of G.
