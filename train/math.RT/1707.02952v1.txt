Let W be a finite Coxeter group and \Omega be its W-graph algebra as defined by Gyoja. The author's previous paper \cite{hahn2016wgraphs} considered this algebra in some detail, proposed, and proved in some small cases the W-graph decomposition conjecture. The purpose of the current paper is to prove a reduction theorem for (a slightly stronger version of) that conjecture to indecomposable Coxeter groups in the sense that the conjecture is true for W=W_1\times W_2 if it holds for W_1 and W_2.
