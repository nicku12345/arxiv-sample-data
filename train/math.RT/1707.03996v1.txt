We introduce a new family of algebras, called Serre-formal algebras. They are Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras for which applying any power of the Serre functor on any indecomposable projective module, the result remains a stalk complex. Typical examples are given by (higher) hereditary algebras and self-injective algebras; it turns out that other interesting algebras such as (higher) canonical algebras are also Serre-formal.   Starting from a Serre-formal algebra, we consider a series of algebras - called the replicated algebras - given by certain subquotients of its repetitive algebra. We calculate the self-injective dimension and dominant dimension of all such replicated algebras and determine which of them are minimal Auslander-Gorenstein, i.e. when the two dimensions are finite and equal to each other. In particular, we show that there exist infinitely many minimal Auslander-Gorenstien algebras in such a series if, and only if, the Serre-formal algebra is twisted fractionally Calabi-Yau.   We apply these results to a construction of algebras from Yamagata, called SGC extensions, given by iteratively taking the endomorphism ring of the smallest generator-cogenerator. We give a sufficient condition so that the SGC extensions and replicated algebras coincide. Consequently, in such a case, we obtain explicit formulae for the self-injective dimension and dominant dimension of the SGC extension algebras.
