Let p be a prime number. We study the dimensions of Brauer constructions of Young and Young permutation modules with respect to p-subgroups of the symmetric groups. They depend only on partitions labelling the modules and the orbits of the action of the p-subgroups, and are related to their generic Jordan types. We obtain some reductive formulae and, in the case of two-part partitions, make some explicit calculation.
