The purpose of this erratum and addendum is to correct the errors in [1]. It consists of five components:   1. Lemma 7.1 and Proposition 7.2 are wrong and discarded;   2. A new proof of existence \lambda(\xi) in (7.1) without Proposition 7.2;   3. Definition of a new bijection in Theorem 5.2 and a proof by a new technique;   4. A new proof of Theorem 5.5 based on the new bijection in Theorem 5.2;   5. Correction to the list of exceptional simple pairs in Proposition 3.1.   The main results of [1] remain true as stated. We also add a final remark on generalization.
