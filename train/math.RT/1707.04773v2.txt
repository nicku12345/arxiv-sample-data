Let \mathbf{G} be a connected reductive algebraic group over \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p and let F : \mathbf{G} \to \mathbf{G} be a Frobenius endomorphism endowing \mathbf{G} with an \mathbb{F}_q-rational structure. Bonnaf\'e--Michel have shown that the Mackey formula for Deligne--Lusztig induction and restriction holds for the pair (\mathbf{G},F) except in the case where q = 2 and \mathbf{G} has a quasi-simple component of type \sf{E}_6, \sf{E}_7, or \sf{E}_8. Using their techniques we show that if q = 2 and Z(\mathbf{G}) is connected then the Mackey formula holds unless \mathbf{G} has a quasi-simple component of type \sf{E}_8. This establishes the Mackey formula, for instance, in the case where (\mathbf{G},F) is of type \sf{E}_7(2). Using this, together with work of Bonnaf\'e--Michel, we can conclude that the Mackey formula holds on the space of unipotently supported class functions if Z(\mathbf{G}) is connected.
