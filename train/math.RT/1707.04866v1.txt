This paper aims at looking for Frobenius subcategories, via the separated monomorphism category {\rm smon}(Q, I, \x), and on the other hand, to establish an {\rm RSS} equivalence from {\rm smon}(Q, I, \x) to its dual {\rm sepi}(Q, I, \x). For a bound quiver (Q, I) and an algebra A, where Q is acyclic and I is generated by monomial relations, let \Lambda=A\otimes_k kQ/I. For any additive subcategory \x of A-mod, we construct {\rm smon}(Q, I, \x) combinatorially. This construction describe Gorenstein-projective \m-modules as \mathcal {GP}(\m) = {\rm smon}(Q, I, \mathcal {GP}(A)). It admits a homological interpretation, and enjoys a reciprocity {\rm smon}(Q, I, \ ^\bot T)= \ ^\bot (T\otimes kQ/I) for a cotilting A-module T. As an application, {\rm smon}(Q, I, \x) has Auslander-Reiten sequences if \x is resolving and contravariantly finite with \widehat{\x}=A-mod. In particular, {\rm smon}(Q, I, A) has Auslander-Reiten sequences. It also admits a filtration interpretation as {\rm smon}(Q, I, \mathscr{X})={\rm Fil}(\mathscr{X}\otimes \mathcal P(kQ/I)), provided that \x is extension-closed. As an application, {\rm smon}(Q, I, \x) is an extension-closed Frobenius subcategory if and only if so is \x. This gives "new" Frobenius subcategories of \m-mod in the sense that they are not \mathcal{GP}(\m). Ringel-Schmidmeier-Simson equivalence {\rm smon}(Q, I, \x)\cong{\rm sepi}(Q, I, \x) is introduced and the existence is proved for arbitrary extension-closed subcategories \x. In particular, the Nakayama functor \mathcal N_\m gives an {\rm RSS} equivalence {\rm smon}(Q, I, A)\cong{\rm sepi}(Q, I, A) if and only if A is Frobenius. For a chain Q with arbitrary I, an explicit formula of an {\rm RSS} equivalence is found for arbitrary additive subcategories \x.
