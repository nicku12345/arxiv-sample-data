Hecke-Hopf algebras were defined by A. Berenstein and D. Kazhdan. We give an explicit presentation of an Hecke-Hopf algebra when the parameter m_{ij}, associated to any two distinct vertices i and j in the presentation of a Coxeter group, equals 4, 5 or 6. As an application, we give a proof of a conjecture of Berenstein and Kazhdan when the Coxeter group is crystallographic and non-simply-laced. As another application, we show that another conjecture of Berenstein and Kazhdan holds when m_{ij}, associated to any two distinct vertices i and j, equals 4 and that the conjecture does not hold when some m_{ij} equals 6 by giving a counterexample to it.
