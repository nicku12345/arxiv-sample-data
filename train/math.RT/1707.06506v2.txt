We prove that for every Bushnell-Kutzko type that satisfies a certain rigidity assumption, the equivalence of categories between the corresponding Bernstein component and the category of modules for the Hecke algebra of the type induces a bijection between irreducible unitary representations in the two categories. This is a generalization of the unitarity criterion of Barbasch and Moy for representations with Iwahori fixed vectors.
