This paper reports key advances in the study of the representation theory of the symplectic blob algebra. For suitable specialisations of the parameters we construct four large families of homomorphisms between cell modules. We hence find a large family of non-semisimple specialisations. We find a minimal poset (i.e. least number of relations) for the symplectic blob as a quasi-hereditary algebra.
