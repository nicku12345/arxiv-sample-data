For A a gentle algebra, and X and Y string modules, we construct a combinatorial basis for Hom(X,\tau Y). We use this to describe support \tau-tilting modules for A. We give a combinatorial realization of maps in both directions realizing the bijection between support \tau-tilting modules and functorially finite torsion classes. We give an explicit basis of Ext^1(Y,X) as short exact sequences. We analyze several constructions given in a more restricted, combinatorial setting by McConville, showing that many but not all of them can be extended to general gentle algebras.
