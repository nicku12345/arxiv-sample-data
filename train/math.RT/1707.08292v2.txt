In this paper we define the modified Ringel-Hall algebra \cm\ch(\ca) of a hereditary abelian category \ca from the category C^b(\mathcal{A}) of bounded \mathbb{Z}-graded complexes. Two main results have been obtained. One is to give a new proof of Green's formula on Ringel-Hall numbers by using the associative multiplication of the modified Ringel-Hall algebra. The other is to show that in certain twisted cases the derived Hall algebra can be embedded in the modified Ringel-Hall algebra. As a consequence of the second result, we get that in certain twisted cases the modified Ringel-Hall algebra is isomorphic to the tensor algebra of the derived Hall algebra and the torus of acyclic complexes and so the modified Ringel-Hall algebra is invariant under derived equivalences.
