For the Kashiwara crystal of a highest weight representation of an affine Lie algebra of type A and rank e, with highest weight \Lambda, there is a labeling by multipartitions and by piecewise linear paths in the real weight space called Littelmann paths. Both labelings are constructed recursively, but since Kashiwara demonstrated that the crystals are isomorphic, there is a bijection between the labels.   We choose a multicharge (k_1,\dots,k_r), with 0 \leq k_1\leq k_2....\leq k_r \leq e-1. We put k_i in the node at the upper left corner of partition i of the multipartition and let the residues from \mathbb Z/ e \mathbb Z increase across rows and decrease down columns. For e=2, we call a multipartition residue-homogeneous if all nonzero rows end in nodes of the same residue and partitions with the same corner residue have first rows of the same parity. It is strongly residue homogeneous if each partition ends in a triangle of whose side has length one less than the first row of the next partition.   In this paper we show that each such multipartition corresponds to a Littelmann path which is unidirectional in the sense that the projection of the the main part of the path to the coordinates of the fundamental weights consists of long paths all lying in either the second or fourth quadrant, separated by oscillating paths with a fixed integer oscillator. The path corresponding to such a multipartition can be constructed non-recursively using only integers describing the structure of the multipartition.
