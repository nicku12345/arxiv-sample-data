Given a nilpotent Lie group N, a compact subgroup K of automorphisms of N and an irreducible unitary representation (\tau,W_\tau) of K, we study conditions on \tau for the commutativity of the algebra of \mathrm{End}(W_\tau)-valued integrable functions on N, with an additional property that generalizes the notion of K-invariance. A necessary condition, proved by F. Ricci and A. Samanta, is that (K\ltimes N,K) must be a Gelfand pair. In this article we determine all the commutative algebras from a particular class of Gelfand pairs constructed by J. Lauret.
