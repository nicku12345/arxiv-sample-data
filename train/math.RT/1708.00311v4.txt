In this paper, we consider the singularity category D_{sg}(\mod A) and the \mathbb{Z}-graded singularity category D_{sg}(\mod^{\mathbb Z} A) for a Gorenstein monomial algebra A. Firstly, for a positively graded 1-Gorenstein algebra, we prove that its {\mathbb Z}-graded singularity category admits silting objects. Secondly, for A=KQ/I being a Gorenstein monomial algebra, we prove that D_{sg}(\mod^{\mathbb Z} A) has tilting objects. As a consequence, D_{sg}(\mod^{\mathbb Z}A) is triangulated equivalent to the derived category of a hereditary algebra H which is of finite representation type. Finally, we give a characterization of 1-Gorenstein monomial algebras, and describe their singularity categories clearly by using the triangulated orbit categories of type {\mathbb A}.
