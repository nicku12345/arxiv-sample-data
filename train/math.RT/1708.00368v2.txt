Let C be a finite dimensional algebra with B a split extension by a nilpotent bimodule E, and let M be a {\tau}-rigid C-module with U its Bongartz {\tau}-complement. If the induced module, M{\otimes_C}B, is {\tau}-rigid as a B-module, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for U{\otimes_C}B to be its Bongartz {\tau}-complement in mod B. If M is {\tau}-rigid in mod B, we again provide a necessary and sufficient condition for U{\otimes_C}B to be its Bongartz {\tau}-complement in mod B.
