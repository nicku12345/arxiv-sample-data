Let G be a complex connected simple algebraic group with a fixed real form \sigma. Let G(\mathbb{R})=G^\sigma be the corresponding group of real points. This paper reports a finiteness theorem for the classification of irreducible unitary Harish-Chandra modules of G(\mathbb{R}) (up to equivalence) having non-vanishing Dirac cohomology. Moreover, we study the distribution of the spin norm along Vogan pencils for certain G(\mathbb{R}), with particular attention paid to the unitarily small convex hull introduced by Salamanca-Riba and Vogan.
