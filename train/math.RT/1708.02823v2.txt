We study the Howe correspondence for unipotent representations of irreducible dual pairs (G',G)=(\text{U}_m(\mathbb{F}_q),\text{U}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)) and (G',G)=(\text{Sp}_{2m}(\mathbb{F}_q),\text{O}^\epsilon_{2n}(\mathbb{F}_q)), where \mathbb{F}_q denotes the finite field with q elements (q odd) and \epsilon=\pm 1. We show how to extract extremal (i.e. minimal and maximal) irreducible subrepresentations from the image of \pi under the correpondence of a unipotent representation \pi of G.
