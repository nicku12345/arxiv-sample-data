Let G = GL_N over an algebraically closed field of odd characteristic, and \theta an involutive automorphism on G such that H = (G^{\theta})^0 is isomorphic to SO_N. Then G^{\iota\theta} = \{ g \in G \mid \theta(g) = g^{-1} \} is regarded as a symmetric space G/G^{\theta}. Let G^{\iota\theta}_{uni} be the set of unipotent elements in G^{\iota\theta}. H acts on G^{\iota\theta}_{uni} by the conjugation. As an analogue of the generalized Springer correspondence in the case of reductive groups, we establish in this paper the generalized Springer correspondence between H-orbits in G^{\iota\theta}_{uni} and irreducible representations of various symmetric groups.
