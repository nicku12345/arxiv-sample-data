We study the Casselman-Jacquet functor J, viewed as a functor from the (derived) category of (\mathfrak{g},K)-modules to the (derived) category of (\mathfrak{g},N^-)-modules, N^- is the negative maximal unipotent. We give a functorial definition of J as a certain right adjoint functor, and identify it as a composition of two averaging functors \text{Av}^{N^-}_!\circ \text{Av}^N_*. We show that it is also isomorphic to the composition \text{Av}^{N^-}_*\circ \text{Av}^N_!. Our key tool is the pseudo-identity functor that acts on the (derived) category of (twisted) D-modules on an algebraic stack.
