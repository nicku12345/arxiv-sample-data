We construct a monoidal category \mathscr{C}_{w,v} which categorifies the doubly-invariant algebra ^{N'(w)}\mathbb{C}[N]^{N(v)} associated with Weyl group elements w and v. It gives, after a localization, the coordinate algebra \mathbb{C}[\mathcal{R}_{w,v}] of the open Richardson variety associated with w and v. The category \mathscr{C}_{w,v} is realized as a subcategory of the graded module category of a quiver Hecke algebra R. When v= \mathrm{id}, \mathscr{C}_{w,v} is the same as the monoidal category which provides a monoidal categorification of the quantum unipotent coordinate algebra A_q(\mathfrak{n}(w))_{\mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]} given by Kang-Kashiwara-Kim-Oh. We show that the category \mathscr{C}_{w,v} contains special determinantial modules \mathsf{M}(w_{\le k}\Lambda, v_{\le k}\Lambda) for k=1, \ldots, \ell(w), which commute with each other. When the quiver Hecke algebra R is symmetric, we find a formula of the degree of R-matrices between the determinantial modules \mathsf{M}(w_{\le k}\Lambda, v_{\le k}\Lambda). When it is of finite ADE type, we further prove that there is an equivalence of categories between \mathscr{C}_{w,v} and \mathscr{C}_u for w,u,v \in \mathsf{W} with w = vu and \ell(w) = \ell(v) + \ell(u).
