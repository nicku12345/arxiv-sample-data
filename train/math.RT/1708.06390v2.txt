Let A be a finite dimensional commutative associative algebra with unit over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. The group G(A) of invertible elements is open in A and thus A has a structure of a prehomogeneous G(A)-module. We show that every prehomogeneous module of a commutative linear algebraic group appears this way. In particular, the number of equivalence classes of prehomogeneous G-modules is finite if and only if the corank of G is at most 5.
