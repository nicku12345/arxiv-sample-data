Let W be an affine Weyl group, and let \Bbbk be a field of characteristic p>0. The diagrammatic Hecke category \mathcal{D} for W over \Bbbk is a categorification of the Hecke algebra for W with rich connections to modular representation theory. We explicitly construct a functor from \mathcal{D} to a matrix category which categorifies a recursive representation \xi : \mathbb{Z}W \rightarrow M_{p^r}(\mathbb{Z}W), where r is the rank of the underlying finite root system. This functor gives a method for understanding diagrammatic Soergel bimodules in terms of other diagrammatic Soergel bimodules which are "smaller" by a factor of p. It also explains the presence of self-similarity in the p-canonical basis, which has been observed in small examples. By decategorifying we obtain a new lower bound on the p-canonical basis, which corresponds to new lower bounds on the characters of the indecomposable tilting modules by the recent p-canonical tilting character formula due to Achar-Makisumi-Riche-Williamson.
