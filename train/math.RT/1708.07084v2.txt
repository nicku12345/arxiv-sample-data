The symbol is used to describe the Springer correspondence for the classical groups. We propose equivalent definitions of symbols for rigid partitions in the B_n, C_n, and D_n theories uniformly. Analysing the new definition of symbol in detail, we give rules to construct symbol of a partition, which are easy to remember and to operate on. We introduce formal operations of a partition, which reduce the difficulties in the proof of the construction rules. According these rules, we give a closed formula of symbols for different theories uniformly. As applications, previous results can be illustrated more clearly by the construction rules of symbol.
