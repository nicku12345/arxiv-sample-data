The Test Function Conjecture due to Haines and Kottwitz predicts that the geometric Bernstein center is a source of test functions required by the Langlands-Kottwitz method for expressing the local semisimple Hasse-Weil zeta function of a Shimura variety in terms of automorphic L-functions. Haines and Rapoport found an explicit formula for such test functions in the Drinfeld case with pro-p Iwahori level structure.   This article generalizes the Haines-Rapoport formula for the Drinfeld case to a broader class of split groups. The main theorem presents a new formula for test functions with pro-p Iwahori level structure, which can be computed through some combinatorics on Coxeter groups. Explicit descriptions of the test function in certain low-rank general linear and symplectic group examples are included.
