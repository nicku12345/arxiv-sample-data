Let p be a prime number and let X be a complex algebraic variety with an action of \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}. We develop the theory of parity complexes in a certain 2-periodic localization of the equivariant constructible derived category D^b_{\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}}(X,\mathbb{Z}_p). Under certain assumptions, we use this to define a functor from the category of parity sheaves on X to the category of parity sheaves on the fixed-point locus X^{\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}}. This may be thought of as a categorification of Smith theory. When X is the affine Grassmannian associated to some complex reductive group, our functor gives a geometric construction of the Frobenius-contraction functor recently defined by M. Gros and M. Kaneda via the geometric Satake equivalence.
