Let G be a connected quasi-split reductive group over \mathbb{R}, and more generally, a quasi-split K-group over \mathbb{R}. Arthur had obtained the formal formula for the spectral side of the stable local trace formula, by using formal substitute of Langlands parameters. In this paper, we construct the spectral side of the stable trace formula and endoscopy trace formula directly for quasi-split K-groups over \mathbb{R}, by incorporating the works of Shelstad. In particular we give the explicit expression for the spectral side of the stable local trace formula, in terms of Langlands parameters.
