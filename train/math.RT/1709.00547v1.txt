We study the problem of indecomposability of translations of simple modules in the principal block of BGG category \mathcal{O} for \mathfrak{sl}_n, as conjectured in \cite{KiM}. We describe some general techniques and prove a few general results which may be applied to study various special cases of this problem. We apply our results to verify indecomposability for n\leq 6. We also study the problem of indecomposability of shufflings and twistings of simple modules and obtain some partial results.
