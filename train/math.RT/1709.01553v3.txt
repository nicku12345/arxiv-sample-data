We prove that every orthogonal Gelfand-Zeitlin algebra U acts on its Gelfand-Zeitlin subalgebra \Gamma. Considering the dual module, we show that every Gelfand-Zeitlin character of \Gamma is realizable in a U-module. We observe that the Gelfand-Zeitlin formulae can be rewritten using divided difference operators. It turns out that the action of the latter operators on \Gamma gives rise to an explicit basis in a certain Gelfand-Zeitlin submodule of the dual module mentioned above. This gives, generically, both in the case of regular and singular Gelfand-Zeitlin characters, an explicit construction of simple modules which realize given Gelfand-Zeitlin characters.
