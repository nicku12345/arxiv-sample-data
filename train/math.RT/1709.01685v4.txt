Let \mathfrak{o} be a complete discrete valuation ring with finide residue field \mathsf{k} of odd characteristic, and let \mathbf{G} be a symplectic or special orthogonal group scheme over \mathfrak{o}. For any \ell\in\mathbb{N} let G^\ell denote the \ell-th principal congruence subgroup of \mathbf{G}(\mathfrak{o}). An irreducible character of the group \mathbf{G}(\mathfrak{o}) is said to be regular if it is trivial on a subgroup G^{\ell+1} for some \ell, and if its restriction to G^\ell/G^{\ell+1}\simeq \mathrm{Lie}(\mathbf{G})(\mathsf{k}) consists of characters of minimal \mathbf{G}(\mathsf{k}^{\rm alg}) stabilizer dimension. In the present paper we consider the regular characters of such classical groups over \mathfrak{o}, and construct and enumerate all regular characters of \mathbf{G}(\mathfrak{o}), when the characteristic of \mathsf{k} is greater than two. As a result, we compute the regular part of their representation zeta function.
