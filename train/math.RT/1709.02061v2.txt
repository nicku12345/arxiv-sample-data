Consider a weighted Coxeter system (W,S,\mathscr{L}). Via its associated Iwahori-Hecke algebra, we may determine the partition of W into Kazhdan-Lusztig cells. In this paper, we use the theory of Vogan classes introduced by Bonnaf\'e--Geck to obtain a combinatorial description of the left cells of type B_n when the ratio of the weights of the first to second generator is n-1. We further give information on the left cells when this ratio lies in the interval (n-2,n-1).
