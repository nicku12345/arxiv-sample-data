The Kronecker modules (or matrix pencils) are the representations of the n-Kronecker quiver K(n) (the quiver with two vertices, namely a sink and a source, and n arrows) over some fixed field. The universal cover of K(n) is the n-regular tree with bipartite orientation.   The paper deals with the representations of the n-regular tree with bipartite orientation (thus with graded Kronecker modules). The simultaneous Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection at all sinks will be called the shift functor, and we consider the orbits under this shift functor. Whereas the length of a regular module growths exponentially when we apply the shift functor repeatedly, the radius of such a module growths just linearly.   To any regular shift orbit, we attach a positive integer r (the minimal radius of the sink modules in the orbit) and the path in T(n) which starts at the center p of the sink modules in the orbit and ends at the center q of the source modules in the orbit. If r is even, then p has to be a sink, otherwise a source. We call this path the center path of the orbit (since the center of any module in the orbit lies on this path). If the center path of a shift orbit has length b, then the orbit contains precisely b flow modules, the remaining modules are sink modules and source modules. We use this division in order to index the regular graded Kronecker modules in a coherent way. Conversely, we show that given a positive integer r and a path in T(n) (starting at a sink iff r is even), there are regular shift orbits with these invariants.
