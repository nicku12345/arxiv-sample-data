The aim of this article is to present a simple generalized Plancherel formula for a locally compact unimodular topological group G of type I. This formula specializes to the Whittaker-Plancherel formula for a split reductive p-adic group of Sakellaridis-Venkatesh and differs from that of a quasi-split p-adic group due to Delorme. Furthermore, it also applies to certain metaplectic groups and other interesting situations where the local theory of distinguished representations has been studied.
