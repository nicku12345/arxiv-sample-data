For the p-Sylow subgroups U of the finite classical groups of untwisted Lie type, p an odd prime, we construct a monomial \mathbb C U-module M which is isomorphic to the regular representation of \mathbb C G by a modification of Kirillov's orbit method called monomial linearisation. We classify a certain subclass of orbits of the U-action on the monomial basis of M consisting of so called staircase orbits and show, that every orbit module in M is isomorphic to a staircase one. Finally we decompose the Andr\'e-Neto supercharacters of U into a sum of U-characters afforded by staircase orbit modules contained in M.
