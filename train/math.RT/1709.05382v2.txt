Let \mathbf{k} be a field of arbitrary characteristic, let \Lambda be a finite dimensional \mathbf{k}-algebra, and let V be an indecomposable Gorenstein-projective \Lambda-module with finite dimension over \mathbf{k}. It follows that V has a well-defined versal deformation ring R(\Lambda, V), which is complete local commutative Noetherian \mathbf{k}-algebra with residue field \mathbf{k}, and which is universal provided that the stable endomorphism ring of V is isomorphic to \mathbf{k}. We prove that if \Lambda is a monomial algebra without overlaps, then R(\Lambda,V) is universal and isomorphic either to \mathbf{k} or to \mathbf{k}[[t]]/(t^2)
