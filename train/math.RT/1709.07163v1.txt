We study the algebra of invariant differential operators on a certain homogeneous vector bundle over a Riemannian symmetric space of type A_2. We computed radial parts of its generators explicitly to obtain matrix-valued commuting differential operators with A_2 symmetry. Moreover, we generalize the commuting differential operators with respect to a parameter and the potential function.
