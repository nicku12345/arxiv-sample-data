Let E/F be an unramified extension of non-archimedean local fields of residual characteristic different than 2. We provide a simple geometric proof of a variation of a result of Y. Hironaka. Namely we prove that the module \mathcal{S}(X)^{K_0} is free over the Hecke algebra \mathcal{H}(SL_{n}(E),SL_{n}(O_E)), where X is the space of unimodular Hermitian forms on E^n and O_E is the ring of integers in E.
