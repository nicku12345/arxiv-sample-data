In this paper we study the structure of the cyclotomic nilHecke algebras \HH_{\ell,n}^{(0)}, where \ell,n\in\N. We construct a monomial basis for \HH_{\ell,n}^{(0)} which verifies a conjecture of Mathas. We show that the graded basic algebra of \HH_{\ell,n}^{(0)} is commutative and hence isomorphic to the center Z of \HH_{\ell,n}^{(0)}. We further prove that \HH_{\ell,n}^{(0)} is isomorphic to the full matrix algebra over Z and construct an explicit basis for the center Z. We also construct a complete set of pairwise orthogonal primitive idempotents of \HH_{\ell,n}^{(0)}. Finally, we present a new homogeneous symmetrizing form \Tr on \HH_{\ell,n}^{(0)} by explicitly specifying its values on a given homogeneous basis of \HH_{\ell,n}^{(0)} and show that it coincides with Shan--Varagnolo--Vasserot's symmetrizing form \Tr^{\text{SVV}} on \HH_{\ell,n}^{(0)}.
