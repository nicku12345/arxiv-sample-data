In this paper, we compute the projective class rings of the tensor product \mathcal{H}_n(q)=A_n(q)\otimes A_n(q^{-1}) of Taft algebras A_n(q) and A_n(q^{-1}), and its cocycle deformations H_n(0,q) and H_n(1,q), where n>2 is a positive integer and q is a primitive n-th root of unity. It is shown that the projective class rings r_p(\mathcal{H}_n(q)), r_p(H_n(0,q)) and r_p(H_n(1,q)) are commutative rings generated by three elements, three elements and two elements subject to some relations, respectively. It turns out that even \mathcal{H}_n(q), H_n(0,q) and H_n(1,q) are cocycle twist-equivalent to each other, they are of different representation types: wild, wild and tame, respectively.
