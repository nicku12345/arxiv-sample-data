Using a representation theoretic parameterization for the orbits in the enhanced cyclic nilpotent cone, derived by the authors in a previous article, we compute the fundamental group of these orbits. This computation has several applications to the representation theory of the category of admissible D-modules on the space of representations of the framed cyclic quiver. First, and foremost, we compute precisely when this category is semi-simple. We also show that the category of admissible D-modules has enough projectives. Finally, the support of an admissible D-module is contained in a certain Lagrangian in the cotangent bundle of the space of representations. Thus, taking characteristic cycles defines a map from the K-group of the category of admissible D-modules to the \mathbb{Z}-span of the irreducible components of this Lagrangian. We show that this map is always injective, and a bijection if and only if the monodromicity parameter is integral.
