Let \Bbbk be a field, G a group, and (Q, I) a bound quiver. A map W\colon Q_1 \to G is called a G-weight on Q, which defines a G-graded \Bbbk-category \Bbbk(Q, W), and W is called homogeneous if I is a homogeneous ideal of the G-graded \Bbbk-category \Bbbk(Q, W). Then we have a G-graded \Bbbk-category \Bbbk(Q, I, W):= \Bbbk(Q, W)/I. We can then form a smash product \Bbbk(Q, I, W)\# G of \Bbbk(Q, I, W) and G, which canonically defines a Galois covering \Bbbk(Q, I, W)\# G \to \Bbbk(Q, I) with group G (we will see that all such Galois coverings to \Bbbk(Q, I) have this form for some W). First we give a quiver presentation \Bbbk(Q_{G, W}, I_{G, W}) \cong \Bbbk(Q, I, W)\# G of the smash product \Bbbk(Q, I, W)\# G. Next if (Q, I, W) is defined by a Brauer graph with an admissible weight then the smash product \Bbbk(Q, I, W)\# G is again defined by a Brauer graph, which will be computed explicitly. The computation is simplified by introducing a concept of Brauer permutations as an intermediate one between Brauer graphs and Brauer bound quivers. This extends and simplifies the result by Green--Schroll--Snashall on the computation of coverings of Brauer graphs, which dealt with the case that G is a finite abelian group, while in our case G is an arbitrary group. In particular, it enables us to delete all cycles in Brauer graphs to transform it to an infinite Brauer tree.
