This paper was inspired by four articles: surface cluster algebras studied by Fomin-Shapiro-Thurston \cite{fst}, the mutation theory of quivers with potentials initiated by Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky \cite{dwz}, string modules associated to arcs on unpunctured surfaces by Assem-Br\ddot{u}stle-Charbonneau-Plamondon \cite{acbp} and Quivers with potentials associated to triangulated surfaces, part II: Arc representations by Labardini-Fragoso. \cite{lf2}. For a surface with marked points (\Sigma,M) Labardini-Fragoso associated a quiver with potential (Q(\tau),S(\tau)) then for an ideal triangulation of (\Sigma,M) and an ideal arc Labardini-Fragoso defined an arc representation of (Q(\tau),S(\tau)). This paper focuses on extent the definition of arc representation to a more general context by considering a tagged triangulation and a tagged arc. We associate in an explicit way a representation of the quiver with potential constructed Labardini-Fragoso and prove that the Jacobian relations are met.
