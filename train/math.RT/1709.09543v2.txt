We study the centrally generated primitive ideals of U(\mathfrak{n}), where \mathfrak{n} is the (locally) nilpotent radical of a (splitting) Borel subalgebra of a simple complex Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}(\mathbb{C}), \mathfrak{o}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}), \mathfrak{o}_{\infty}(\mathbb{C}). In the infinite-dimensional setting, there are infinitely many isomorphism classes of Lie algebras \mathfrak{n}, and we fix \mathfrak{n} with "largest possible" center of U(\mathfrak{n}). We characterize the centrally generated primitive ideals of U(\mathfrak{n}) in terms of the Dixmier map and the Kostant cascade.
