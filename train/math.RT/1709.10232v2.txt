We construct a Young wall model for higher level A_2^{(2)}-type adjoint crystals. The Young walls and reduced Young walls are defined in connection with affin energy function. We prove that the affine crystal consisiting of reduced Young walls provides a realization of highest weight crystals B(\lambda) and B(\infty).
