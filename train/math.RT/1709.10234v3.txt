Using the twisted denominator identity, we derive a closed form root multiplicity formula for all symmetrizable Borcherds-Bozec algebras and discuss its applications including the case of Monster Borcherds-Bozec algebra. In the second half of the paper, we provide the Schofield constuction of symmetric Borcherds-Bozec algebras.
