For each two-dimensional vector space V of commuting n\times n matrices over a field \mathbb F with at least 3 elements, we denote by \widetilde V the vector space of all (n+1)\times(n+1) matrices of the form \left[\begin{smallmatrix}A&*\\0&0\end{smallmatrix}\right] with A\in V. We prove the wildness of the problem of classifying Lie algebras \widetilde V with the bracket operation [u,v]:=uv-vu. We also prove the wildness of the problem of classifying two-dimensional vector spaces consisting of commuting linear operators on a vector space over a field.
