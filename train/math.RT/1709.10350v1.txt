Let \mathbb F be a field of characteristic not 2, and let (A,B) be a pair of n\times n matrices over \mathbb F, in which A is symmetric and B is skew-symmetric. A canonical form of (A,B) with respect to congruence transformations (S^TAS,S^TBS) was given by Sergeichuk (1988) up to classification of symmetric and Hermitian forms over finite extensions of \mathbb F. We obtain a simpler canonical form of (A,B) if B is nonsingular. Such a pair (A,B) defines a quadratic form on a symplectic space, that is, on a vector space with scalar product given by a nonsingular skew-symmetric form. As an application, we obtain known canonical matrices of quadratic forms and Hamiltonian operators on real and complex symplectic spaces.
