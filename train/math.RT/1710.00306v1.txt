A real form G_0 of a complex semisimple Lie group G has only finitely many orbits in any given compact G-homogeneous projective algebraic manifold Z=G/Q. A maximal compact subgroup K_0 of G_0 has special orbits C which are complex sub-manifolds in the open orbits of G_0. These are referred to as cycles. The cycles intersect Shubert varieties S transversely in finitely many points. In particular, determining these points of intersection yields a description of the topological class of the given cycle. This was carried out for all real forms of SL(n,\mathbb{C}) in the work of A. Brecan. Our work here is devoted to the real forms of the other classical groups, Sp(2n,\mathbb{C}) and SO(n,\mathbb{C}). For the manifold Z=G/B of complete flags the points of intersection in S\cap C are described, in particular the number of such is computed. For certain real forms, e.g., Sp(2n,\mathbb{R}) and SO^*(2n), remarkably simple formulas are proved. In other cases the results are algorithmic in nature.
