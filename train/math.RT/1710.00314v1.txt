The monomorphism category \mathscr{S}(A, M, B) induced by a bimodule _AM_B is the subcategory of \Lambda-mod consisting of \left[\begin{smallmatrix} X\\ Y\end{smallmatrix}\right]_{\phi} such that \phi: M\otimes_B Y\rightarrow X is a monic A-map, where \Lambda=\left[\begin{smallmatrix} A&M\\0&B \end{smallmatrix}\right]. In general, it is not the monomorphism categories induced by quivers. It could describe the Gorenstein-projective \m-modules. This monomorphism category is a resolving subcategory of \modcat{\Lambda} if and only if M_B is projective. In this case, it has enough injective objects and Auslander-Reiten sequences, and can be also described as the left perpendicular category of a unique basic cotilting \Lambda-module. If M satisfies the condition {\rm (IP)}, then the stable category of \mathscr{S}(A, M, B) admits a recollement of additive categories, which is in fact a recollement of singularity categories if \mathscr{S}(A, M, B) is a {\rm Frobenius} category. Ringel-Schmidmeier-Simson equivalence between \mathscr{S}(A, M, B) and its dual is introduced. If M is an exchangeable bimodule, then an {\rm RSS} equivalence is given by a \Lambda-\Lambda bimodule which is a two-sided cotilting \Lambda-module with a special property; and the Nakayama functor \mathcal N_\m gives an {\rm RSS} equivalence if and only if both A and B are Frobenius algebras.
