The present paper focuses on the study of t-stabilities on a triangulated category in the sense of Gorodentsev, Kuleshov and Rudakov. We give an equivalent description for the finest t-stability on a piecewise hereditary triangulated category and, describe the semistable subcategories and final HN triangles for (exceptional) coherent sheaves in D^b(\rm{coh}\mathbb{X}), which is the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on the weighted projective line \mathbb{X} of weight type (2). Furthermore, we show the existence of a t-exceptional triple for D^b(\rm{coh}\mathbb{X}). As an application, we obtain a result of Dimitrov--Katzarkov which states that each stability condition \sigma in the sense of Bridgeland admits a \sigma-exceptional triple for the acyclic triangular quiver Q. Note that this implies the connectedness of the space of stability conditions associated to Q.
