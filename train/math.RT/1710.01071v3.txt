The definitions of replicable and completely replicable functions are intimately related to the Hecke operators for the modular group. We define the notions of "(2+)-replicable" and "completely (2+)-replicable" functions by considering the Hecke operators for \Gamma_0(2)^+. We prove that the McKay-Thompson series for 2\cdot\mathbb{B}, as computed by H\"ohn, are completely (2+)-replicable.
