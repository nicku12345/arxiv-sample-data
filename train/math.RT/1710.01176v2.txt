In this paper we study right n-Nakayama algebras. Right n-Nakayama algebras appear naturally in the study of representation-finite algebras. We show that an artin algebra \Lambda is representation-finite if and only if \Lambda is right n-Nakayama for some positive integer n. We classify hereditary right n-Nakayama algebras. We also define right n-coNakayama algebras and show that an artin algebra \Lambda is right n-coNakayama if and only if \Lambda is left n-Nakayama. We then study right 2-Nakayama algebras. We show how to compute all the indecomposable modules and almost split sequences over a right 2-Nakayama algebra. We end by classifying finite dimensional right 2-Nakayama algebras in terms of their quivers with relations.
