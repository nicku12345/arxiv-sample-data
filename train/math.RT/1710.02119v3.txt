We show that any accordion complex associated to a dissection of a convex polygon is isomorphic to the support \tau-tilting simplicial complex of an explicit finite dimensional algebra. To this end, we prove a property of some induced subcomplexes of support \tau-tilting simplicial complexes of finite dimensional algebras.
