The multiplicity of a weight \mu in an irreducible representation of a simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} with highest weight \lambda can be computed via the use of Kostant's weight multiplicity formula. This formula is an alternating sum over the Weyl group and involves the computation of a partition function. In this paper we consider a q-analog of Kostant's weight multiplicity and present a SageMath program to compute q-multiplicities for the simple Lie algebras.
