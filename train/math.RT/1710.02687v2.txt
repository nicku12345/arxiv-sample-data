We detail an explicit construction of ordinary irreducible representations for the family of finite groups SL_2({\mathbb Z} /p^n {\mathbb Z}) for odd primes p and n\geq 2. For n=2, the construction is a complete set of irreducible complex representations, while for n>2, all but a handful are obtained. We also produce an algorithm for the computation of a Fourier transform for a function on SL_2({\mathbb Z} /p^2 {\mathbb Z}). With this in hand we explore the spectrum of a collection of Cayley graphs on these groups, extending analogous computations for Cayley graphs on SL_2({\mathbb Z}/p {\mathbb Z}) and suggesting conjectures for the expansion properties of such graphs.
