For a connected semisimple real Lie group G of non-compact type, Wallach introduced a class of K-types called small. We classify all small K-types for all simple Lie groups and prove except just one case that each elementary spherical function for each small K-type (\pi,V) can be expressed as a product of hyperbolic cosines and a Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric function. As an application, the inversion formula for the spherical transform on G\times_K V is obtained from Opdam's theory on hypergeometric Fourier transforms.
