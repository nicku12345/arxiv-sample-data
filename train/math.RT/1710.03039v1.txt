In [APS], the authors characterize the partitions of n whose corresponding representations of S_n have nontrivial determinant. The present paper extends this work to all irreducible finite Coxeter groups W. Namely, given a nontrivial multiplicative character \omega of W, we give a closed formula for the number of irreducible representations of W with determinant \omega. For Coxeter groups of type B_n and D_n, this is accomplished by characterizing the bipartitions associated to such representations.
