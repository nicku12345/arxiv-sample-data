Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over a field K with enveloping algebra A^e=A^{op} \otimes_K A. We call algebras A that have the property that the subcategory of Gorenstein projective modules in mod-A coincide with the subcategory \{ X \in mod-A | Ext_A^i(X,A)=0  for all i \geq 1 \} left nearly Gorenstein. The class of left nearly Gorenstein algebras is a large class that includes for example all Gorenstein algebras and all representation-finite algebras. We prove that the Gorenstein dimension of A coincides with the Gorenstein projective dimension of the regular module as A^e-module for left nearly Gorenstein algebras A. We give three application of this result. The first generalises a formula by Happel for the global dimension of algebras. The second application generalises a criterion of Shen for an algebra to be selfinjective. As a final application we prove a stronger version of the first Tachikawa conjecture for left nearly Gorenstein algebras.
