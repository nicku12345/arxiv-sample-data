Extending results of Rais-Tauvel, Macedo-Savage, and Arakawa-Premet, we prove that under mild restrictions on the Lie algebra \mathfrak q having the polynomial ring of symmetric invariants, the m-th Takiff algebra of \mathfrak q, \mathfrak q\langle m\rangle, also has a polynomial ring of symmetric invariants.
