Cocenters of Hecke algebras \mathcal H play an important role in studying mod \ell or \mathbb C harmonic analysis on connected p-adic reductive groups. On the other hand, the depth r Hecke algebra \mathcal H_{r^+} is well suited to study depth r smooth representations. In this paper, we study depth r rigid cocenters \overline{\mathcal H}^{\mathrm{rig}}_{r^+} of a connected reductive p-adic group over rings of characteristic zero or \ell\neq p. More precisely, under some mild hypotheses, we establish a Jordan decomposition of the depth r rigid cocenter, hence find an explicit basis of \overline{\mathcal H}^{\mathrm{rig}}_{r^+}.
