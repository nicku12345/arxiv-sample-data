Let A be a Nakayama algebra with n simple modules and a simple module S of even projective dimension m. Choose m minimal such that a simple A-module with projective dimension 2m exists, then we show that the global dimension of A is bounded by n+m-1. This gives a combined generalisation of results of Gustafson \cite{Gus} and Madsen \cite{Mad}. In \cite{Bro}, Brown proved that the global dimension of quasi-hereditary Nakayama algebras with n simple modules is bounded by n. Using our result on the bounds of global dimensions of Nakayama algebras, we give a short new proof of this result and generalise Brown's result from quasi-hereditary to standardly stratified Nakayama algebras, where the global dimension is replaced with the finitistic dimension.
