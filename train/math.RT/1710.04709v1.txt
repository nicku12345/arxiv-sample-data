In order to compute Hermitian forms on representations of real reductive groups, in the unequal rank case, it is necessary to compute twisted Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials. These were defined by Lusztig and Vogan (Quasisplit Hecke algebras and Symmetric Spaces, Duke, 2014) and discussed further by Adams and Vogan (Parameters for twisted representations, 2015). These notes contain the details necessary to go from what is in those papers to an explicit algorithm. This algorithm has been implemented in the Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations software.
