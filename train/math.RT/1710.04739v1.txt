We study the Yangian Y_n associated to the general linear Lie algebra \mathfrak{gl}_n over a field of positive characteristic, as well as its shifted analog Y_n(\sigma). Our main result gives a description of the centre of Y_n(\sigma): it is a polynomial algebra generated by its Harish-Chandra centre (which lifts the centre in characteristic zero) together with a large p-centre. Moreover, Y_n(\sigma) is free as a module over its center. In future work, it will be seen that every reduced enveloping algebra U_\chi(\mathfrak{gl}_n) is Morita equivalent to a quotient of an appropriate choice of shifted Yangian, and so our results will have applications in classical representation theory.
