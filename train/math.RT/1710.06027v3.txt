We consider abelian length categories, a generalization of module categories over Artin algebras. Let \mathcal{A} be an abelian length category of colocal type. We show that the lattice \mathsf{S}(\mathcal{A}) of full additive subobject closed subcategories of \mathcal{A} is distributive. Furthermore, we give a characterization of abelian length categories of colocal type.   If A is an algebra of colocal type over an algebraically closed field, then this characterization is especially simple and we can describe the lattice \mathsf{S(mod} ~A) up to isomorphism.
