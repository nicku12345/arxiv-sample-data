Let \pi  be an irreducible smooth complex representation of a general linear p-adic group and let \sigma  be an irreducible complex supercuspidal representation of a classical p-adic group of a given type, so that \pi\otimes\sigma  is a representation of a standard Levi subgroup of a p-adic classical group of higher rank. We show that the reducibility of the representation of the appropriate p-adic classical group obtained by (normalized) parabolic induction from \pi\otimes\sigma  does not depend on \sigma , if \sigma  is "separated" from the supercuspidal support of \pi . (Here, "separated" means that, for each factor \rho  of a representation in the supercuspidal support of \pi , the representation parabolically induced from \rho\otimes\sigma  is irreducible.) This was conjectured by E. Lapid and M. Tadi\'c. (In addition, they proved, using results of C. Jantzen, that this induced representation is always reducible if the supercuspidal support is not separated.)   More generally, we study, for a given set I of inertial orbits of supercuspidal representations of p-adic general linear groups, the category \CC _{I,\sigma} of smooth complex finitely generated representations of classical p-adic groups of fixed type, but arbitrary rank, and supercuspidal support given by \sigma  and I, show that this category is equivalent to a category of finitely generated right modules over a direct sum of tensor products of extended affine Hecke algebras of type A, B and D and establish functoriality properties, relating categories with disjoint I's. In this way, we extend results of C. Jantzen who proved a bijection between irreducible representations corresponding to these categories. The proof of the above reducibility result is then based on Hecke algebra arguments, using Kato's exotic geometry.
