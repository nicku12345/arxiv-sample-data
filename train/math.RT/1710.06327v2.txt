The universal centralizer of a semisimple algebraic group G is the family of centralizers of regular elements in Lie(G), parametrized by their conjugacy classes. It has a natural symplectic structure inherited via Hamiltonian reduction from the cotangent bundle T*G. We construct a smooth log-symplectic partial compactification of the universal centralizer where each fiber is compactified inside the wondeful compactification of G.
