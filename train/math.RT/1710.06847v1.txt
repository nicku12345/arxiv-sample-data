We introduce the local and global indices of Dirac operators for the rational Cherednik algebra \mathsf{H}_{t,c}(G,\mathfrak{h}), where G is a complex reflection group acting on a finite-dimensional vector space \mathfrak{h}. We investigate precise relations between the (local) Dirac index of a simple module in the category \mathcal{O} of \mathsf{H}_{t,c}(G,\mathfrak{h}), the graded G-character of the module, the Euler-Poincar\'e pairing, and the composition series polynomials for standard modules. In the global theory, we introduce integral-reflection modules for \mathsf{H}_{t,c}(G,\mathfrak{h}) constructed from finite-dimensional G-modules. We define and compute the index of a Dirac operator on the integral-reflection module and show that the index is, in a sense, independent of the parameter function c. The study of the kernel of these global Dirac operators leads naturally to a notion of dualised generalised Dunkl-Opdam operators.
