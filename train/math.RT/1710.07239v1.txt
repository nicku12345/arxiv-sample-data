Let \mathcal{A} be an essentially small abelian category. We prove that if \mathcal{A} admits a generator M with {\rm End}_{\mathcal{A}}(M) right artinian, then \mathcal{A} admits a projective generator. If \mathcal{A} is further assumed to be Grothendieck, then this implies that \mathcal{A} is equivalent to a module category. When \mathcal{A} is Hom-finite over a field k, the existence of a generator is the same as the existence of a projective generator, and in case there is such a generator, \mathcal{A} has to be equivalent to the category of finite dimensional right modules over a finite dimensional k-algebra. We also show that when \mathcal{A} is a length category, then there is a one-to-one correspondence between exact abelian extension closed subcategories of \mathcal{A} and collections of Hom-orthogonal Schur objects in \mathcal{A}.
