We construct a minimal representation of the orthosymplectic Lie supergroup OSp(p,q|2n), generalising the Schr\"odinger model of the minimal representation of O(p,q) to the super case. The underlying Lie algebra representation is realized on functions on the minimal orbit inside the Jordan superalgebra associated with \mathfrak{osp}(p,q|2n), so that our construction is in line with the orbit philosophy. Its annihilator is given by a Joseph-like ideal for \mathfrak{osp}(p,q|2n), and therefore the representation is a natural generalization of a minimal representations to the context of Lie superalgebras. We also calculate its Gelfand--Kirillov dimension and construct a non-degenerate sesquilinear form for which the representation is skew-symmetric and which is the analogue of an L^2-inner product in the supercase.
