Let G be a finite group with Sylow 2-subgroup P \leqslant G. Navarro-Tiep-Vallejo have conjectured that the principal 2-block of N_G(P) contains exactly one irreducible Brauer character if and only if all odd-degree ordinary irreducible characters in the principal 2-block of G are fixed by a certain Galois automorphism \sigma \in \mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}_{|G|}/\mathbb{Q}). Recent work of Navarro-Vallejo has reduced this conjecture to a problem about finite simple groups. We show that their conjecture holds for all finite simple groups, thus establishing the conjecture for all finite groups.
