Let \Lambda be a finite-dimensional associative algebra. The torsion classes of mod\, \Lambda form a lattice under containment, denoted by tors\, \Lambda. In this paper, we characterize the cover relations in tors\, \Lambda by certain indecomposable modules. We consider three applications: First, we show that the completely join-irreducible torsion classes (torsion classes which cover precisely one element) are in bijection with bricks. Second, we characterize faces of the canonical join complex of tors\, \Lambda in terms of representation theory. Finally, we show that, in general, the algebra \Lambda is not characterized by its lattice tors\, \Lambda. In particular, we study the torsion theory of a quotient of the preprojective algebra of type A_n. We show that its torsion class lattice is isomorphic to the weak order on A_n.
