When G_{\mathbb{R}} is a real, linear algebraic group, the orbit method predicts that nearly all of the unitary dual of G_{\mathbb{R}} consists of representations naturally associated to orbital parameters (\mathcal{O},\Gamma). If G_{\mathbb{R}} is a real, reductive group and \mathcal{O} is a semisimple coadjoint orbit, the corresponding unitary representation \pi(\mathcal{O},\Gamma) may be constructed utilizing Vogan and Zuckerman's cohomological induction together with Mackey's real parabolic induction. In this article, we give a geometric character formula for such representations \pi(\mathcal{O},\Gamma). Special cases of this formula were previously obtained by Harish-Chandra and Kirillov when G_{\mathbb{R}} is compact and by Rossmann and Duflo when \pi(\mathcal{O},\Gamma) is tempered.
