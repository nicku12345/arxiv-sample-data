Let \mathsf{J(C)} be the poset of order ideals of a cominuscule poset \mathsf{C} where \mathsf{C} comes from two of the three infinite families of cominuscule posets or the exceptional cases. We show that the Auslander-Reiten translation \tau on the Grothendieck group of the bounded derived category for the incidence algebra of the poset \mathsf{J(C)}, which is called the \emph{Coxeter transformation} in this context, has finite order. Specifically, we show that \tau^{h+1}=\pm id where h is the Coxeter number for the relevant root system.
