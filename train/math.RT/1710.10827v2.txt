For a suitable triangulated category \mathcal{T} with a Serre functor S and a full precovering subcategory \mathcal{C} closed under summands and extensions, an indecomposable object C in \mathcal{C} is called Ext-projective if Ext^1(C,\mathcal{C})=0. Then there is no Auslander-Reiten triangle in \mathcal{C} with end term C. In this paper, we show that if, for such an object C, there is a minimal right almost split morphism \beta:B\rightarrow C in \mathcal{C}, then C appears in something very similar to an Auslander-Reiten triangle in \mathcal{C}: an essentially unique triangle in \mathcal{T} of the form \begin{align*}   \Delta= X\xrightarrow{\xi} B\xrightarrow{\beta} C\rightarrow \Sigma X, \end{align*} where X is an indecomposable not in \mathcal{C} and \xi is a \mathcal{C}-envelope of X. Moreover, under some extra assumptions, we show that removing C from \mathcal{C} and replacing it with X produces a new subcategory of \mathcal{T} closed under extensions. We prove that this process coincides with the classic mutation of \mathcal{C} with respect to the rigid subcategory of \mathcal{C} generated by all the indecomposable Ext-projectives in \mathcal{C} apart from C.   When \mathcal{T} is the cluster category of Dynkin type A_n and \mathcal{C} has the above properties, we give a full description of the triangles in \mathcal{T} of the form \Delta and show under which circumstances replacing C by X gives a new extension closed subcategory.
