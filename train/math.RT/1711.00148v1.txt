Let G be a connected complex reductive algebraic group with Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. The Lusztig--Vogan bijection relates two bases for the bounded derived category of G-equivariant coherent sheaves on the nilpotent cone \mathcal{N} of \mathfrak{g}. One basis is indexed by \Lambda^+, the set of dominant weights of G, and the other by \Omega, the set of pairs (\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{E}) consisting of a nilpotent orbit \mathcal{O} \subset \mathcal{N} and an irreducible G-equivariant vector bundle \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}. The existence of the Lusztig--Vogan bijection \gamma \colon \Omega \rightarrow \Lambda^+ was proven by Bezrukavnikov, and an algorithm computing \gamma in type A was given by Achar. Herein we present a combinatorial description of \gamma in type A that subsumes and dramatically simplifies Achar's algorithm.
