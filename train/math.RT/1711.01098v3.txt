Let F be a non-Archimedan local field, G a connected reductive group defined and split over F, and T a maximal F-split torus in G. Let \chi_0 be a depth zero character of the maximal compact subgroup \mathcal{T} of T(F). It gives by inflation a character \rho of an Iwahori subgroup \mathcal{I} of G(F) containing \mathcal{T}. From Roche, \chi_0 defines a split endoscopic group G' of G, and there is an injective morphism of {\Bbb C}-algebras \mathcal{H}(G(F),\rho) \rightarrow \mathcal{H}(G'(F),1_{\mathcal{I}'}) where \mathcal{H}(G(F),\rho) is the Hecke algebra of compactly supported \rho^{-1}-spherical functions on G(F) and \mathcal{I}' is an Iwahori subgroup of G'(F). This morphism restricts to an injective morphism \zeta: \mathcal{Z}(G(F),\rho)\rightarrow \mathcal{Z}(G'(F),1_{\mathcal{I}'}) between the centers of the Hecke algebras. We prove here that a certain linear combination of morphisms analogous to \zeta realizes the transfer (matching of strongly G-regular semisimple orbital integrals). If {\rm char}(F)=p>0, our result is unconditional only if p is large enough.
