The author establishes finite-generation of the cohomology ring of a classical Lie superalgebra relative to an even subsuperalgebra. A spectral sequence is constructed to provide conditions for when this relative cohomology ring is Cohen-Macaulay. With finite generation established, support varieties for modules are defined via the relative cohomology, which generalize those of [BKN-1]
