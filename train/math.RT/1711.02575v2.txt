Let F be a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic not equal to 2, let E/F be a finite unramified extension field, and let \sigma be a generator of \text{Gal}(E, F ). Let f be an element of Z(H_{I_E}), the center of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra for GL_2(E), and let b be the Iwahori base change homomorphism from Z(H_{I_E}) to Z(H_{I_F}), the center of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra for GL_2(F) [8]. This paper proves the matching of the \sigma-twisted orbital integral over GL_2(E) of f with the orbital integral over GL_2(F) of bf. To do so, we compute the orbital and \sigma-twisted orbital integrals of the Bernstein functions z_{\mu}. These integrals are computed by relating them to counting problems on the set of edges in the building for SL_2. Surprisingly, the integrals are found to be somewhat independent of the conjugacy class over which one is integrating. The matching of the integrals follows from direct comparison of the results of these computations. The fundamental lemma proved here is an important ingredient in the study of Shimura varieties with Iwahori level structure at a prime p [7].
