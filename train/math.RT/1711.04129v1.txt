Let \mathfrak g be a simple Lie algebra with a Borel subalgebra \mathfrak b. To any long positive root \gamma, one associates two ideals of \mathfrak b: the abelian ideal I(\gamma)_{max} and not necessarily abelian ideal I\langle{\succcurlyeq}\gamma\rangle. It is known that I(\gamma)_{max} \subset I\langle{\succcurlyeq}\gamma\rangle, and \gamma is said to be amazing if the equality holds. The set of amazing roots, \mathcal A, is closed under the operation `\vee' in \Delta^+, and \gamma\in\mathcal A is said to be primitive, if it cannot be written as \gamma_1\vee\gamma_2 with incomparable amazing roots \gamma_1,\gamma_2. We classify the amazing roots and notice that the number of primitive roots equals \mathsf{rk}(\mathfrak g). Moreover, if \Pi (resp. \mathcal A_{\sf pr}) is the set of simple (resp. primitive) roots, then there is a natural bijection \Pi\longleftrightarrow \mathcal A_{\sf pr}. We also describe the set \mathcal A\cap{\mathcal H}, where {\mathcal H} is the Heisenberg subset of \Delta^+.
