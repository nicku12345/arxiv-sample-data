Let \C be a triangulated category with a cluster tilting subcategory \T. We introduce the notion of \T[1]-cluster tilting subcategories (also called ghost cluster tilting subcategories) of \C, which are a generalization of cluster tilting subcategories. We first develop a basic theory on ghost cluster tilting subcategories. Secondly, we study links between ghost cluster tilting theory and \tau-tilting theory: Inspired by the work of Iyama, J{\o}rgensen and Yang \cite{ijy}, we introduce the notion of \tau-tilting subcategories and tilting subcategories of \mod\T. We show that there exists a bijection between weak \T[1]-cluster tilting subcategories of \C and support \tau-tilting subcategories of \mod\T. Moreover, we figure out the subcategories of \mod\T which correspond to cluster tilting subcategories of \C. This generalizes and improves several results by Adachi-Iyama-Reiten \cite{AIR}, Beligiannis \cite{Be2}, and Yang-Zhu \cite{YZ}. Finally, we prove that the definition of ghost cluster tilting objects is equivalent to the definition of relative cluster tilting objects introduced by the first and the third author in \cite{YZ}.
