An irreducible weight module of an affine Kac-Moody algebra \mathfrak{g} is called dense if its support is equal to a coset in \mathfrak{h}^{*}/Q. Following a conjecture of V. Futorny about affine Kac-Moody algebras \mathfrak{g}, an irreducible weight \mathfrak{g}-module is dense if and only if it is cuspidal (i.e. not a quotient of an induced module). The conjecture is confirmed for \mathfrak{g}=A_{2}^{\left(1\right)}, A_{3}^{\left(1\right)} andA_{4}^{\left(1\right)} and a classification of the supports of the irreducible weight \mathfrak{g}-modules obtained. For all A_{n}^{\left(1\right)} the problem is reduced to finding primitive elements for only finitely many cases, all lying below a certain bound. For the left-over finitely many cases an algorithm is proposed, which leads to the solution of Futorny's conjecture for the cases A_{2}^{\left(1\right)} and A_{3}^{\left(1\right)}. Yet, the solution of the case A_{4}^{\left(1\right)} required additional combinatorics.   For the proofs, a new category of hypoabelian Lie subalgebras, pre-prosolvable subalgebras, and a subclass thereof, quasicone subalgebras, is introduced and its tropical matrix algebra structure outlined.
