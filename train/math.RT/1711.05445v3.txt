We study Verdier quotients of diverse homotopy categories of a full additive subcategory \mathcal E of an abelian category. In particular, we consider the categories K^{x,y}({\mathcal E}) for x\in\{\infty, +,-,b\}, and y\in\{\emptyset,b,+,-,\infty\} the homotopy categories of left, right, unbounded complexes with homology being 0, bounded, left or right bounded, or unbounded. Inclusion of these categories give a partially ordered set, and we study localisation sequences or recollement diagrams between the Verdier quotients, and prove that many quotients lead to equivalent categories.
