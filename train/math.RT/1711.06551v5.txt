We prove Lusztig's conjectures {\bf P1}--{\bf P15} for the affine Weyl group of type \tilde{G}_2 for all choices of parameters. Our approach to compute Lusztig's \mathbf{a}-function is based on the notion of a "balanced system of cell representations" for the Hecke algebra. We show that for arbitrary Coxeter type the existence of balanced system of cell representations is sufficient to compute the \mathbf{a}-function and we explicitly construct such a system in type \tilde{G}_2 for arbitrary parameters. We then investigate the connection between Kazhdan-Lusztig cells and the Plancherel Theorem in type \tilde{G}_2, allowing us to prove {\bf P1} and determine the set of Duflo involutions. From there, the proof of the remaining conjectures follows very naturally, essentially from the combinatorics of Weyl characters of types G_2 and A_1, along with some explicit computations for the finite cells.
