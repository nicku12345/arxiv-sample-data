A good knowledge of the Jordan canonical form (JCF) for a tensor product of `Jordan blocks' is key to understanding the actions of p-groups of matrices in characteristic p. The JCF corresponds to a certain partition which depends on the characteristic p, and the study of these partitions dates back to Aitken's work in 1934. Equivalently each JCF corresponds to a certain permutation \pi introduced by Norman in 1995. These permutations \pi = \pi(r,s,p) depend on the dimensions r, s of the Jordan blocks, and on p. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for \pi(r,s,p) to be trivial, building on work of M.J. Barry. We show that when \pi(r,s,p) is nontrivial, it is an involution involving reversals. Finally, we prove that the group G(r,p) generated by \pi(r,s,p) for all s, `factors' as a wreath product corresponding to the factorisation r=ab as a product of its p'-part a and p-part b: precisely G(r, p)={\sf S}_a\wr {\sf D}_b where {\sf S}_a is a symmetric group of degree a, and {\sf D}_b is a dihedral group of degree b.
