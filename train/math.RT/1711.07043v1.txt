Relative Auslander algebras were introduced and studied by Beligiannis. In this paper, we apply intermediate extension functors associated to certain recollements of functor categories to study them. In particular, we study the existence of tilting-cotilting modules over such algebras. As a consequence, it will be shown that two Gorenstein algebras of G-dimension 1 being of finite Cohen-Macaulay type are Morita equivalent if and only if their Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebras are Morita equivalent.
