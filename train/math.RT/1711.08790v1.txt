In this paper we explore the concept of depth of a ring extension when the overall algebra factorises as a product of two subalgebras, in particular the case of finite dimensional Hopf algebras. As a result we generalise the results by Kadison and Young \cite{HKY} on depth of a Hopf algebra H in its smash product with a finite dimensional left H-module algebra A, A#H to the context of generalised smash products Q^{*op}#_\psi H \cite{Bz1} where Q is the quotient module coalgebra associated to the extension R\subseteq H of finite dimensional Hopf algebras \cite{Ka2}\cite{HKY}\cite{H}. Moreover, following the construction of double crossed products in \cite{Ma} and \cite{Ma1} we use our result on factorisation algebras to get a general result on the depth of the extension of a Hopf algebra H in its Drinfel\vtick d double D(H). \mathbf{Keywords : } Depth, Factorisation Algebra, Smash Product, Drinfel\vtick d Double, Double Crossed Product, Normal Extension. \mathbf{Subject} \mathbf{classification: } 20C05, 20G05, 16W30, 17B37, 13E10.
