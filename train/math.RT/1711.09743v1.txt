We describe the dimensions of low Hochschild cohomology spaces of exceptional periodic representation-infinite algebras of polynomial growth. As an application we obtain that an indecomposable non-standard periodic representation-infinite algebra of polynomial growth is not derived equivalent to a standard self-injective algebra.
