Let \mathfrak{g} be a root-reductive Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field \mathbb{K} of characteristic 0 with a splitting Borel subalgebra \mathfrak{b} containing a splitting maximal toral subalgebra \mathfrak{h}. We study the category \bar{\mathcal{O}} consisting of all \mathfrak{h}-weight \mathfrak{g}-modules which are locally \mathfrak{b}-finite and have finite-dimensional \mathfrak{h}-weight spaces. The focus is on very special Borel subalgebras called the Dynkin Borel subalgebras. This paper serves as an initial passage to the understanding of categories \mathcal{O} for infinite-dimensional root-reductive Lie algebras.
