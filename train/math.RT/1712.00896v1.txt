In 2006, Gao and Zeng \cite{GZ} gave the free field realizations of highest weight modules over a class of extended affine Lie algebras. In the present paper, applying the technique of localization to those free field realizations, we construct a class of new weight modules over the extended affine Lie algebras. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for these modules to be irreducible. In this way, we construct free field realizations for a class of simple weight modules with infinite weight multiplicities over the extended affine Lie algebras.
