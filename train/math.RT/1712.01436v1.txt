For any triple (\mu,\lambda,\alpha) of complex numbers and an \mathfrak a-module {V}, a class of non-weight modules \mathcal{M}\big(V,\mu,\Omega(\lambda,\alpha)\big) over the Virasoro algebra \mathcal L is constructed in this paper. We prove if V is a nontrivial simple \mathfrak a-module satisfying: for any v\in V there exists r\in\Z_+ such that L_{r+i}v=0 for all i\geq1, then \mathcal{M}\big(V,\mu,\Omega(\lambda,\alpha)\big) is simple if and only if \mu\neq1, \lambda\neq0,\alpha\neq0,. We also give the necessary and sufficient conditions for two such simple \mathcal L-modules being isomorphic. Finally, we prove that these simple \mathcal L-modules \mathcal{M}\big(V,\mu,\Omega(\lambda,\alpha)\big) are new by showing they are not isomorphic to any other known simple non-weight module provided that V is not a highest weight \mathfrak a-module with highest weight nonzero.
