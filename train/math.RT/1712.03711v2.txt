In Part I, we use Steenrod's construction to prove that the quantum Coulomb branch is a Frobenius-constant quantization. We will also demonstrate the corresponding result for the K-theoretic version of the quantum Coulomb branch. In Part II, we use the same method to construct a functor of categorical p-center between the derived Satake categories with and without loop-rotation, which extends the Frobenius twist functor for representations of the dual group.
