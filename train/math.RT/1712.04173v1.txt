Let G_{\mathbb{R}} be a simple real linear Lie group with maximal compact subgroup K_{\mathbb{R}} and assume that {\rm rank}(G_\mathbb{R})={\rm rank}(K_\mathbb{R}). In \cite{MPVZ} we proved that for any representation X of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension \frac{1}{2}\dim(G_{\mathbb{R}}/K_{\mathbb{R}}), the polynomial on the dual of a compact Cartan subalgebra given by the dimension of the Dirac index of members of the coherent family containing X is a linear combination, with integer coefficients, of the multiplicities of the irreducible components occurring in the associated cycle. In this paper we compute these coefficients explicitly.
