Let \mathbf G be a complex orthogonal or complex symplectic group, and let G be a real form of \mathbf G, namely G is a real orthogonal group, a real symplectic group, a quaternionic orthogonal group, or a quaternionic symplectic group. For a fixed parity \mathbb p\in \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z, we define a set \mathrm{Nil}^{\mathbb p}_{\mathbf G}(\mathfrak g) of nilpotent \mathbf G-orbits in \mathfrak g (the Lie algebra of \mathbf G). When \mathbb p is the parity of the dimension of the standard module of \mathbf G, this is the set of the stably trivial special nilpotent orbits, which includes all rigid special nilpotent orbits. For each \mathcal O \in \mathrm{Nil}^{\mathbb p}_{\mathbf G}(\mathfrak g), we construct all unipotent representations of G (or its metaplectic cover when G is a real symplectic group and \mathbb p is odd) attached to \mathcal O via the method of theta lifting and show in particular that they are unitary.
