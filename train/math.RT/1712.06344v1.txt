The space of smooth sections of an equivariant line bundle over the real projective space \mathbb{R}{\rm P}^n forms a natural representation of the group {\rm GL}(n+1,\mathbb{R}). We explicitly construct and classify all intertwining operators between such representations of {\rm GL}(n+1,\mathbb{R}) and its subgroup {\rm GL}(n,\mathbb{R}), intertwining for the subgroup. Intertwining operators of this form are called symmetry breaking operators, and they describe the occurrence of a representation of {\rm GL}(n,\mathbb{R}) inside the restriction of a representation of {\rm GL}(n+1,\mathbb{R}). In this way, our results contribute to the study of branching problems for the real reductive pair ({\rm GL}(n+1,\mathbb{R}),{\rm GL}(n,\mathbb{R})). The analogous classification is carried out for intertwining operators between algebraic sections of line bundles, where the Lie group action of {\rm GL}(n,\mathbb{R}) is replaced by the action of its Lie algebra \mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R}), and it turns out that all intertwining operators arise as restrictions of operators between smooth sections.
