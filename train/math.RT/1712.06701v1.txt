This paper is an extended version of four lectures at PIMS in Vancouver given June 27 - 30, 2016. The primary goal of these lectures was to publicize the author's recent efforts to extend to representations of linear algebraic groups the "theory of support varieties" which has proved successful in the study of representations of finite group schemes. The lectures offer readers an introduction to the subject together with "homework problems, simplify and clarify some points in the literature, and mention some directions for future research.
