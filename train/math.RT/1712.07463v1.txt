In \cite{SSZ}, the authors proved that an Artin algebra A with infinite global dimension has an indecomposable module with infinite projective and infinite injective dimension, giving a new characterisation of algebras with finite global dimension. We prove in this article that an Artin algebra A that is not Gorenstein has an indecomposable A-module with infinite Gorenstein projective dimension and infinite Gorenstein injective dimension, which gives a new characterisation of algebras with finite Gorenstein dimension. We show that this gives a proper generalisation of the result in \cite{SSZ} for Artin algebras.
