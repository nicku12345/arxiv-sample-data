Consider a nilpotent element e in a simple complex Lie algebra. The Springer fibre corresponding to e admits a discretization (discrete analogue) introduced by the author in 1999. In this paper we propose a conjectural description of that discretization which is more amenable to computation. We also propose a conjectural PBW analogue of that discretization. This version differs substantially from the previous one.
