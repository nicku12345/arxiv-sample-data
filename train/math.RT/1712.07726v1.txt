In this paper we study highest weight and standardly stratified structures on modular analogs of categories \mathcal{O} over quantizations of symplectic resolutions and show how to recover the usual categories \mathcal{O} (reduced mod p\gg 0) from our modular categories. More precisely, we consider a conical symplectic resolution that is defined over a finite localization of \mathbb{Z} and is equipped with a Hamiltonian action of a torus T that has finitely many fixed points. We consider algebras \mathcal{A}_\lambda of global sections of a quantization in characterstic p\gg 0, where \lambda is a parameter. Then we consider a category \tilde{\mathcal{O}}_\lambda consisting of all finite dimensional T-equivariant \mathcal{A}_\lambda-modules. We show that for \lambda lying in a {\it p-alcove} \,^p\!A, the category \tilde{\mathcal{O}}_\lambda is highest weight (in some generalized sense). Moreover, we show that every face of \,^p\!A that survives in \,^p\!A/p when p\rightarrow \infty defines a standardly stratified structure on \tilde{\mathcal{O}}_\lambda. We identify the associated graded categories for these standardly stratified structures with reductions mod p of the usual categories \mathcal{O} in characteristic 0. Applications of our construction include computations of wall-crossing bijections in characteristic p and the existence of gradings on categories \mathcal{O} in characteristic 0.
