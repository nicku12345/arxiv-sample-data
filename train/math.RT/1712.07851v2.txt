Let {\mathscr T} be a triangulated category. If T is a cluster tilting object and I = [ \operatorname{add} T ] is the ideal of morphisms factoring through an object of \operatorname{add} T, then the quotient category {\mathscr T} / I is abelian. This is an important result of cluster theory, due to Keller-Reiten and K\"{o}nig-Zhu. More general conditions which imply that {\mathscr T} / I is abelian were determined by Grimeland and the first author.   Now let {\mathscr T} be a suitable ( d+2 )-angulated category for an integer d \geqslant 1. If T is a cluster tilting object in the sense of Oppermann-Thomas and I = [ \operatorname{add} T ] is the ideal of morphisms factoring through an object of \operatorname{add} T, then we show that {\mathscr T} / I is d-abelian.   The notions of ( d+2 )-angulated and d-abelian categories are due to Geiss-Keller-Oppermann and Jasso. They are higher homological generalisations of triangulated and abelian categories, which are recovered in the special case d = 1. We actually show that if \Gamma = \operatorname{End}_{ \mathscr T }T is the endomorphism algebra of T, then {\mathscr T} / I is equivalent to a d-cluster tilting subcategory of \operatorname{mod} \Gamma in the sense of Iyama; this implies that {\mathscr T} / I is d-abelian. Moreover, we show that \Gamma is a d-Gorenstein algebra.   More general conditions which imply that {\mathscr T} / I is d-abelian will also be determined, generalising the triangulated results of Grimeland and the first author.
