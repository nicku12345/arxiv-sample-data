Let (A,B) be a pair of skew-symmetric matrices over a field of characteristic not 2. Its regularization decomposition is a direct sum \[ (\underline{\underline A},\underline{\underline B})\oplus (A_1,B_1)\oplus\dots\oplus(A_t,B_t) \] that is congruent to (A,B), in which (\underline{\underline A},\underline{\underline B}) is a pair of nonsingular matrices and (A_1,B_1), \dots, (A_t,B_t) are singular indecomposable canonical pairs of skew-symmetric matrices under congruence. We give an algorithm that constructs a regularization decomposition. We also give a constructive proof of the known canonical form of (A,B) under congruence over an algebraically closed field of characteristic not 2.
