We introduce web supercategories of type Q. We describe the structure of these categories and show they have a symmetric braiding. The main result of the paper shows these diagrammatically defined monoidal supercategories provide combinatorial models for the monoidal supercategories generated by the supersymmetric tensor powers of the natural supermodule for the Lie superalgebra of type Q.
