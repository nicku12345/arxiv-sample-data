We classify all the decomposition matrices of the generic Hecke algebras on 3 strands in characteristic 0. These are the generic Hecke algebras associated to the exceptional complex reflection groups G_4, G_8 and G_{16}. We prove that for every choice of the parameters that define these algebras, all ordinary representations are obtained as modular reductions of irreducible representations.
