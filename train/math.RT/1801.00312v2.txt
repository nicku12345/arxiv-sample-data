We study a coarse moduli space of irreducible representations of the group of unipotent matrices of order \mathbb{4} over the ring of integers which have finite weight. All such representations are known to be monomial. To describe a coarse moduli space of such representations, we need to study pairs of subgroups and their characters, which induce non-isomorphic irreducible representations. We obtain a full classification of such pairs and, respectively, a coarse moduli space.
