The geometric Langlands program is an exciting direction of research, although a lot of progress has been made there are still open questions and gaps. One of the necessary steps for this program is the proof of the existence and the cohomological triviality (more precisely, the O- contractibility) of the space of rational opers. In this paper, we prove the homotopical contractibility of the space of rational opers for classical groups.
