We find the spectrum in maximal lexicographic order for quantum states \rho_{AB}\in\mathcal{H}_A\otimes \mathcal{H}_B with margins \rho_A=\frac{1}{n}I_n and \rho_B=\frac{1}{m}I_m and discuss the construction of \rho_{AB}. By nonzero rectangular Kronecker coefficients, we give counterexamples for Klyachko's conjecture which says that a quantum state with maximal lexicographical spectrum has minimal rank among all states with given margins. Moreover, we show that quantum states with the maximal lexicographical spectrum are extreme points.
