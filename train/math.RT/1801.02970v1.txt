In this expository paper, we present a construction of tree modules and combine it with (infinite dimensional) tilting theory and relative Mittag-Leffler conditions in order to explore limits of the approximation theory of modules. We also present a recent generalization of this construction due to Saroch which applies to factorization properties of maps, and yields a solution of an old problem by Auslander concerning existence of almost split sequences.
