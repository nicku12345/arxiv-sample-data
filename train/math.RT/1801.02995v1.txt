In this paper, we study the relations between left-invariant flat connections on Lie groups, left-symmetric algebras, symplective Lie algebras, Frobenius Lie algebras and cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces. More specifically, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between left-symmetric Lie algebras with a right identity and cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces of a Lie group. As an application of our approach, we study the classification of the reduced cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces (G,\r{ho},V) where G is a reductive Lie group. Fortunately, we prove that any of the left-symmetric structure on a reductive Lie algebra has a right identity. Then to give the complete classification of left-symmetric structure on reductive Lie algebras, we just need to give the classification of cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces for reductive Lie groups.
