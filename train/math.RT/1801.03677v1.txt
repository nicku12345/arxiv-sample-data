We call a finite-dimensional K-algebra A geometrically irreducible if for all d all connected components of the affine scheme of d-dimensional A-modules are irreducible. We prove that a geometrically irreducible algebra with exactly two simple modules has to be of a very special form, which we describe. Based on this result we prove that every minimal geometrically irreducible algebra without shortcuts in its Gabriel quiver has at most two simple modules.
