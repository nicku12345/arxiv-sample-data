We define the affine VW supercategory \mathit{s}\hspace{-0.7mm}\bigvee\mkern-15mu\bigvee, which arises from studying the action of the periplectic Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{p}(n) on the tensor product M\otimes V^{\otimes a} of an arbitrary representation M with several copies of the vector representation V of \mathfrak{p}(n). It plays a role analogous to that of the degenerate affine Hecke algebras in the context of representations of the general linear group; the main obstacle was the lack of a quadratic Casimir element in \mathfrak{p}(n)\otimes \mathfrak{p}(n). When M is the trivial representation, the action factors through the Brauer supercategory \mathit{s}\mathcal{B}\mathit{r}. Our main result is an explicit basis theorem for the morphism spaces of \mathit{s}\hspace{-0.7mm}\bigvee\mkern-15mu\bigvee and, as a consequence, of \mathit{s}\mathcal{B}\mathit{r}. The proof utilises the close connection with the representation theory of \mathfrak{p}(n). As an application we explicitly describe the centre of all endomorphism algebras, and show that it behaves well under the passage to the associated graded and under deformation.
