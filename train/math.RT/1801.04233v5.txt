We prove some injectivity results: that a Coxeter monoid \mathbb{Z}-algebra (or 0-Hecke algebra) injects in the incidence \mathbb{Z}-algebra of the corresponding Bruhat poset, for any Coxeter group; that the Hecke algebra of a right-angled Coxeter group injects in the Coxeter monoid \mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]-algebra (and then in the incidence \mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]-algebra of the corresponding Bruhat poset); that a right-angled Artin group injects in the group of invertible elements of the Hecke algebra of the corresponding Coxeter group (and then in the group of invertible elements of a Coxeter monoid algebra and in the one of an incidence algebra).
