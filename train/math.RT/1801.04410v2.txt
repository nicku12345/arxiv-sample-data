In this paper, we prove that if an abelian category \mathcal{A} admits a recollement relative to abelian categories \mathcal{A}' and \mathcal{A}'', there is a bijection between wide subcategories in \mathcal{A} containing i_{*}(\mathcal{A}') and wide subcategories in \mathcal{A}'' similar to silting reduction and \tau-tilting reduction. Moreover, the wide subcategory \mathcal{C} of \mathcal{A} containing i_{*}(\mathcal{A}') admits a new recollement relative to wide subcategories \mathcal{A}' and j^{*}(\mathcal{C}) which induced from the original recollement.
