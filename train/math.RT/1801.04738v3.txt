For a finite dimensional algebra \Lambda and a non-negative integer n, we characterize when the set \tilt_n\Lambda of additive equivalence classes of tilting modules with projective dimension at most n has a minimal (or equivalently, minimum) element. This generalize results of Happel-Unger. Moreover, for an n-Gorenstein algebra \Lambda with n\geq 1, we construct a minimal element in \tilt_{n}\Lambda.   As a result, we give equivalent conditions for a k-Gorenstein algebra to be Iwanaga-Gorenstein. Moreover, for an 1-Gorenstein algebra \Lambda and its factor algebra \Gamma=\Lambda/(e), we show that there is a bijection between \tilt_1\Lambda and the set \sttilt\Gamma of isomorphism classes of basic support \tau-tilting \Gamma-modules, where e is an idempotent such that e\Lambda  is the additive generator of projective-injective \Lambda-modules.
