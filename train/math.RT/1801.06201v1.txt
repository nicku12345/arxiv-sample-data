We propose a categorification of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra in terms of the equivariant K-theory of the framed matrix factorizations. The construction generalizes the earlier construction of the authors for a categorification of the finite Hecke algebra of type A.   We also explain why our construction provides a faithful realization of the Hecke algebras and discuss a geometric realization of the Jucys-Murphy subalgebra.
