We show, for a field {\mathbb F} of prime characteristic p>0, that the truncated filiform Lie algebra {\frak m}_0(p) admits a family {\frak m}_0^\lambda(p) of restricted Lie algebra structures parameterized by elements \lambda\in {\mathbb F}^p. We compute the ordinary cohomology groups H^q({\frak m}_0^\lambda(p)) and restricted cohomology groups H^q_*({\frak m}_0^\lambda(p)) for q=1, 2, and we give explicit descriptions of bases for these cohomology spaces. We apply our results to restricted one-dimensional central Extensions of the algebras {\frak m}_0^\lambda(p).
