In this paper, we construct a geometric model for the bounded derived category of a gentle algebra. The construction is based on the ribbon graph associated to a gentle algebra by the third author, and is linked to partially wrapped Fukaya categories by the work of Haiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich and to derived categories of coherent sheaves on nodal stacky curves by the work of Lekili and Polishchuk. The ribbon graph gives rise to an oriented surface with boundary and marked points in the boundary. We show that the homotopy classes of curves connecting marked points and of closed curves are in bijection with the isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects in the bounded derived category of the gentle algebra. Intersections of curves correspond to morphisms and resolving the crossings of curves gives rise to mapping cones. The Auslander-Reiten translate corresponds to rotating endpoints of curves along the boundary. Furthermore, we show that the surface encodes the derived invariant of Avella-Alaminos and Geiss.
