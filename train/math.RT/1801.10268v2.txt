We find the irreducible decomposition of the Weil representation of the unitary group \mathrm{U}_{2n}(A), where A is a ramified quadratic extension of a finite, commutative, local, principal ideal ring R and the nilpotency degree of the maximal ideal of A is odd. We show in particular that this Weil representation is multiplicity free. Restriction to the special unitary group \mathrm{SU}_{2n}(A) preserves irreducibility and multiplicity freeness provided n>1.
