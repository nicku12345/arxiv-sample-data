The main aim of this paper is to construct irreducible (\mathfrak{g},K)-modules of \mathrm{O}(p,q) corresponding to the finite-dimensional representation of \mathfrak{sl}_2 of dimension m+1 under the Howe duality, to find the K-type formula, the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension and the Bernstein degree of them, where m is a non-negative integer. The K-type formula for m=0 shows that it is nothing but the (\mathfrak{g},K)-module of the minimal representation of \mathrm{O}(p,q). One finds that the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is equal to p+q-3 not only for m=0 but for any m satisfying m+3 \leq (p+q)/2 when p, q \geq 2 and p+q is even, and that the Bernstein degree for m is equal to (m+1) times that for m=0.
