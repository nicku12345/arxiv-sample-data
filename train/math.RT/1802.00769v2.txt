In this paper, we initiate the study of the twisted weak order associated to a twisted Bruhat order for a Coxeter group and explore the relationship between the lattice property of such order and the infinite reduced words. We show that for a 2 closure biclosed set B in \Phi^+, the B-twisted weak order is a non-complete meet semilattice if B is the inversion set of an infinite reduced word and that the converse also holds in the case of affine Weyl groups.
