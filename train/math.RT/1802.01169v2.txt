We introduce the notions of \tau-exceptional and signed \tau-exceptional sequences for any finite dimensional algebra. We prove that for a fixed algebra of rank n, and for any positive integer t \leq n, there is a bijection between the set of such sequences of length t, and (basic) ordered support \tau-rigid objects with t indecomposable direct summands. If the algebra is hereditary, our notions coincide with exceptional and signed exceptional sequences. The latter were recently introduced by Igusa and Todorov, who constructed a similar bijection in the hereditary setting.
