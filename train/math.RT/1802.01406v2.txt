Let \mathscr{H}_n denote the Iwahori-Hecke algebra corresponding to the symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_n. We set up a Green correspondence for bimodules of these Hecke algebras, and a Brauer correspondence between their blocks. We examine Specht modules for \mathscr{H}_n and compute the vertices of certain Specht modules, before using this to give a classification of the vertices of blocks of \mathscr{H}_n in any characteristic. Finally, we apply this classification to resolve the Dipper-Du conjecture about the structure of vertices of indecomposable \mathscr{H}_n-modules.
