We consider two types of nilpotent invariants associated to smooth representations, namely generalized Whittaker models, and associated characters (in the case of a real reductive group). We survey some recent results on the behavior of these nilpotent invariants under local theta correspondence, and highlight the special role of a certain double fiberation of moment maps.
