The irreducible components of the variety of all modules over the preprojective algebra and MV cycles both index bases of the universal enveloping algebra of the positive part of a semisimple Lie algebra canonically. To relate these two objects Baumann and Kamnitzer associate a cycle in the affine Grassmannian for a given module. It is conjectured that the ring of functions of the T-fixed point subscheme of the associated cycle is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of the quiver Grassmannian of the module. I give a proof of part of this conjecture. Given this conjecture, I give a proof of the reduceness conjecture.
