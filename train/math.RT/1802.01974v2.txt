Let G be a connected real reductive group with maximal compact subgroup K of the same rank as G. In the recent paper of Huang, Pand\v{z}i\'{c} and Vogan, it was shown that the admissible \Theta--stable parabolic subalgebras \mathfrak{q} of \mathfrak{g} are in one-to-one correspodence with the faces of W \rho intersecting the \mathfrak{k}--dominant Weyl chamber and that A_{\mathfrak{q}}(0)--modules can be classified by their Dirac cohomology in geometric terms. They described in detail the cases when \mathfrak{g}_0 is of type A, B, F and C except for \mathfrak{g}_0 = \mathfrak{sp}(2n, \mathbb{R}). We will describe faces corresponding to A_{\mathfrak{q}}(0)--modules for \mathfrak{g}_0 = \mathfrak{sp}(2n, \mathbb{R}) and for \mathfrak{g}_0 of type D and G_2.
