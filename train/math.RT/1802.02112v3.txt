We study the truncation functors and show the existence of projective cover of each irreducible module in parabolic BGG category \mathcal O over infinite rank Lie algebra of types \mathfrak{a,b,c,d}. Moreover, \mathcal O is a Koszul category. As a consequence, the corresponding parabolic BGG category \overline{\mathcal O} over infinite rank Lie superalgebra of types \mathfrak{a,b,c,d} through the super duality is also a Koszul category.
