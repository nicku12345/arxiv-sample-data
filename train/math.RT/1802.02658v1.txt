Let G be a locally compact group with left regular representation \lambda_{G}. We say that G admits a frame of translates if there exist a countable set \Gamma\subset G and \varphi\in L^{2}(G) such that (\lambda_{G}(x) \varphi)_{x \in\Gamma} is a frame for L^{2}(G). The present work aims to characterize locally compact groups having frames of translates, and to this end, we derive necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the existence of such frames. Additionally, we exhibit surprisingly large classes of Lie groups admitting frames of translates.
