We propose a general framework to contract unitary dual of Lie groups via holomorphic quantization of their co-adjoint orbits. The sufficient condition for the contractability of a representation is expressed via cocycles on coadjoint orbits. This condition is checked explicitly for the contraction of {\mathrm SU}_2 into \mathbb{H}. The main tool is the geometric quantization. We construct two types of contractions that can be implemented on every matrix Lie group with diagonal contraction matrix.
