We provide a complete classification of finite-dimensional self-injective algebras which are socle equivalent to preprojective algebras of generalized Dynkin type. In particular, we conclude that these algebras are deformed preprojective algebras of generalized Dynkin type (in the sense of [5, 12]), and hence are periodic algebras.
