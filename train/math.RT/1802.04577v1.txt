We give a complete description of finite dimensional selfinjective algebras over an algebraically closed field whose Auslander-Reiten quiver admits a generalized standard family of quasi-tubes maximally saturated by simple and projective modules. In particular, we show that these algebras are selfinjective algebras of strictly canonical type.
