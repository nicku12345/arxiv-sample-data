Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebras are the endomorphism algebras of representation generators of the subcategory of Gorenstein projective modules over \rm{CM}-finite algebras. In this paper, we study Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebras over 1-Gorenstein algebras and \Omega_{\mathcal{G}}-algebras. 1-Gorenstein algebras are those of algebras with global Gorenstein projective dimension at most one and \Omega_{\mathcal{G}}-algebras are a class of algebras introduced in this paper, including some important class of algebras for example Gentle algebras and more generally quadratic monomial algebras. It will be shown how the results for Gorenstein projective representations of a quiver over an Artin algebra, including the submodule category introduced in [RS], or more generally, the (separated) monomorphism category defined in [LZh2] and [XZZ], can be applied to study the Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebras.
