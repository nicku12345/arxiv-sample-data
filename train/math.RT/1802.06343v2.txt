We study a version of the BGG category O for Dynkin Borel subalgebras of root-reductive Lie algebras g, such as gl(\infty). We prove results about extension fullness and compute the higher extensions of simple modules by Verma modules. In addition, we show that our category O is Ringel self-dual and initiate the study of Koszul duality. An important tool in obtaining these results is an equivalence we establish between appropriate Serre subquotients of category O for g and category O for finite dimensional reductive subalgebras of g.
