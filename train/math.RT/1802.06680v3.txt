In the present article, we examine linear representations of finite gyrogroups, following their group-counterparts. In particular, we prove the celebrated theorem of Maschke for gyrogroups, along with its converse. This suggests studying the left regular action of a gyrogroup (G, \oplus) on the function space  L^{\mathrm{gyr}}(G) = \{f\in L(G)\colon \forall a, x, y, z\in G, f(a\oplus\mathrm{gyr}[x, y]z) = f(a\oplus z)\}  in a natural way, where L(G) is the space of all functions from G into a field.
