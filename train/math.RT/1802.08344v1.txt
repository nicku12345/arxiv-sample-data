Kirillov's orbit theory provides a powerful tool for the investigation of irreducible unitary representations of many classes of Lie groups. In a previous paper we used a modification hereof, called monomial linearisation, to construct a monomial basis of the regular representation of p-Sylow subgroups U of the finite classical groups of untwisted type. In this sequel to this article we determine the stabilizers of special orbit generators and show, that for the groups of Lie type {\mathfrak{B}}_n and {\mathfrak{D}}_n a subclass of the orbit modules decompose the U-modules affording the Andr\'{e}-Neto supercharacters into a direct sum of submodules. Moreover these special orbit modules are either isomorphic or have no irreducible constituent in common, and each irreducible U module is up to isomorphism constituent of precisely one of these.
