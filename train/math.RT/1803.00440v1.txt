In this paper we prove the existence of the Dunkl weight function K_{c, \lambda} for any irreducible representation \lambda of any finite Coxeter group W, generalizing previous results of Dunkl. In particular, K_{c, \lambda} is a family of tempered distributions on the real reflection representation of W taking values in \text{End}_\mathbb{C}(\lambda), with holomorphic dependence on the complex multi-parameter c. When the parameter c is real, the distribution K_{c, \lambda} provides an integral formula for Cherednik's Gaussian inner product \gamma_{c, \lambda} on the Verma module \Delta_c(\lambda) for the rational Cherednik algebra H_c(W, \mathfrak{h}). In this case, the restriction of K_{c, \lambda} to the hyperplane arrangement complement \mathfrak{h}_{\mathbb{R}, reg} is given by integration against an analytic function whose values can be interpreted as braid group invariant Hermitian forms on KZ(\Delta_c(\lambda)), where KZ denotes the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov functor introduced by Ginzburg-Guay-Opdam-Rouquier. This provides a concrete connection between invariant Hermitian forms on representations of rational Cherednik algebras and invariant Hermitian forms on representations of Iwahori-Hecke algebras, and we exploit this connection to show that the KZ functor preserves signatures, and in particular unitarizability, in an appropriate sense.
