The symmetric group on a set acts transitively on its subsets of a given size. We define homomorphisms between the corresponding permutation modules, defined over a field of characteristic two, which generalize the boundary maps from simplicial homology. The main results determine when these chain complexes are exact and when they are split exact. As a corollary we obtain a new explicit construction of the basic spin modules for the symmetric group.
