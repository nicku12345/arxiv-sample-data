Given n \in \mathbf{N}, consider the imprimitive wreath product C_2 \wr S_n. We study the structure of modules whose ordinary characters form an involution model of FC_2 \wr S_n, where F is a field of odd prime characteristic. We classify the vertices of these modules in this case. We then use this classification of the vertices to describe certain columns of the decomposition matrix of C_2 \wr S_n.
