Let A be an Artin algebra. It is well known that A is selfinjective if and only if every finitely generated A-module is reflexive. In this article we pose and motivate the question whether an algebra A is selfinjective if and only if every simple module is reflexive. We give a positive answer to this question for large classes of algebras which include for example all Gorenstein algebras and all QF-3 algebras.
