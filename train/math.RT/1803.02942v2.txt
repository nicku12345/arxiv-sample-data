We use duality theorems to obtain presentations of some categories of modules. To derive these presentations we generalize a result of Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison [arXiv:1210.6437v4]:   Let \mathfrak{g} be a reductive Lie algebra, and A an algebra, both over \mathbb{C}. Consider a (\mathfrak{g} , A)-bimodule P in which   (a) P has a multiplicity free decomposition into irreducible (\mathfrak{g} , A)-bimodules.   (b) P is "saturated" i.e. for any irreducible \mathfrak{g}-module V, if every weight of V is a weight of P, then V is a submodule of P.   We show that statements (a) and (b) are necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism of categories between the full subcategory of \mathcal{R}ep A whose objects are \mathfrak{g}-weight spaces of P, and a quotient of the category version of Lusztig's idempotented form, \dot{{\mathcal{U}}} \mathfrak{g}, formed by setting to zero all morphisms factoring through a collection of objects in \dot{{\mathcal{U}}} \mathfrak{g} depending on P. This is essentially a categorical version of the identification of generalized Schur algebras with quotients of Lusztig's idempotented forms given by Doty in [arXiv:math/0305208].   Applied to Schur-Weyl Duality we obtain a diagrammatic presentation of the full subcategory of \mathcal{R}ep S_d whose objects are direct sums of permutation modules, as well as an explicit description of the \otimes-product of morphisms between permutation modules. Applied to Brauer-Schur-Weyl Duality we obtain diagrammatic presentations of subcategories of \mathcal{R}ep \mathcal{B}_{d}^{(- 2n)} and \mathcal{R}ep \mathcal{B}_{r,s}^{(n)} whose Karoubi completion is the whole of \mathcal{R}ep \mathcal{B}_{d}^{(- 2n)} and \mathcal{R}ep \mathcal{B}_{r,s}^{(n)} respectively.
