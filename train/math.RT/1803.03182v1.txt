Let P be a principal indecomposable module of a finite group G in characteristic 2 and let \varphi be the Brauer character of the corresponding simple G-module. We show that P affords a non-degenerate G-invariant quadratic form if and only if there are involutions s,t\in G such that st has odd order and \varphi(st)/2 is not an algebraic integer.   We then show that the number of isomorphism classes of quadratic principal indecomposable G-modules is equal to the number of strongly real conjugacy classes of odd order elements of G.
