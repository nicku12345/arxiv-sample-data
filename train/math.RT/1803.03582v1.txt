A "weight" on a quiver Q with values in a group G is a function which assigns an element of G for each arrow in Q. This paper shows that the essential steps in the mutation of quivers with potential [DWZ] goes through with weights provided that the weights on each cycle in the potential have trivial product. This gives another proof of the sign coherence of c-vectors. We also classify all weights on tame quivers.
