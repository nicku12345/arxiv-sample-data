Let V be an n-dimensional algebraic representation over an algebraically closed field K of a group G. For m > 0, we study the invariant rings K[V^{ m}]^G for the diagonal action of G on V^m. In characteristic zero, a theorem of Weyl tells us that we can obtain all the invariants in K[V^m]^G by the process of polarization and restitution from K[V^n]^G. In particular, this means that if K[V^n]^G is generated in degree \leq d, then so is K[V^m]^G no matter how large m is.   There are several explicit counterexamples to Weyl's theorem in positive characteristic. However, when G is a (connected) reductive affine group scheme over \mathbb{Z} and V^* is a good G-module, we show that Weyl's theorem holds in sufficiently large characteristic. As a special case, we consider the ring of invariants R(n,m) for the left-right action of {\rm SL}_n \times {\rm SL}_n on m-tuples of n \times n matrices. In this case, we show that the invariants of degree \leq n^6 suffice to generate R(n,m) if the characteristic is larger than 2n^6 + n^2.
