To study the set of torsion classes of a finite dimensional basic algebra, we use a decomposition, called sign-decomposition, parametrized by elements of \{\pm1\}^n where n is the number of simple modules. If A is an algebra with radical square zero, then for each \epsilon \in \{\pm1\}^n there is a hereditary algebra A_{\epsilon}^! with radical square zero and a bijection between the set of torsion classes of A associated to \epsilon and the set of faithful torsion classes of A_{\epsilon}^!. Furthermore, this bijection preserves the property of being functorially finite. As an application in \tau-tilting theory, we prove that the number of support \tau-tilting modules over Brauer line algebras (resp. Brauer odd-cycle algebras) having n edges is \binom{2n}{n} (resp. 2^{2n-1}).
