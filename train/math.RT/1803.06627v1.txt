We give an introductory survey of the results in arXiv: 1708.01418. We discuss a sheafified elliptic quantum group associated to any symmetric Kac-Moody Lie algebra. The sheafification is obtained by applying the equivariant elliptic cohomological theory to the moduli space of representations of a preprojective algebra. By construction, the elliptic quantum group naturally acts on the equivariant elliptic cohomology of Nakajima quiver varieties. As an application, we obtain a relation between the sheafified elliptic quantum group and the global affine Grassmannian over an elliptic curve.
