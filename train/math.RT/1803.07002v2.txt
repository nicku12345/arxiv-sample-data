Let \Phi be a finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field k and assume gldim\,\Phi\leq d, for some fixed positive integer d. For d=1, Br\"uning proved that there is a bijection between the wide subcategories of the abelian category mod\,\Phi and those of the triangulated category \mathcal{D}^b(\text{mod}\Phi). Moreover, for a suitable triangulated category \mathcal{M}, J{\o}rgensen gave a description of Auslander-Reiten triangles in the extension closed subcategories of \mathcal{M}.   In this paper, we generalise these results for d-abelian and (d+2)-angulated categories, where kernels and cokernels are replaced by complexes of d+1 objects and triangles are replaced by complexes of d+2 objects. The categories are obtained as follows: if \mathcal{F}\subseteq \text{mod} \Phi is a d-cluster tilting subcategory, consider \overline{\mathcal{F}}:=\text{add} \{\Sigma^{id}\mathcal{F}\mid i\in\mathbb{Z} \}\subseteq \mathcal{D}^b(\text{mod}\Phi). Then \mathcal{F} is d-abelian and plays the role of a higher mod\,\Phi having for higher derived category the (d+2)-angulated category \overline{\mathcal{F}}.
