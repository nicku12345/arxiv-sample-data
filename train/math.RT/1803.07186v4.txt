Over a finite-dimensonal algbera A, simple A-modules that have projective dimension one have special properties. For example, Geigle-Lenzing studied them in connection to homological epimorphisms of rings, and they have also appeared in work concerning the finitistic dimension conjecture. If we however work in a d-cluster-tilting subcategory, then not all simples are contained in this subcategory. In this context, a replacement might be to work with idempotent ideals instead, and utilise the theory of Auslander-Platzeck-Todorov. We introduce the notion of a fabric idempotent as an analogue of the localising modules studied by Chen-Krause, and to illustrate the theory we show that they provide rich combinatorial properties. An application is to extend the classification of singularity categories of Nakayama algebras by Chen-Ye to higher Nakayama algebras.
