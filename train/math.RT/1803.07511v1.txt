We introduce the notion of relative pseudocoefficient for relative discrete series of real spherical homogeneous spaces of reductive groups. We prove that such relative pseudocoefficient does not exist for semisimple symmetric spaces of type G(C)/G(R) and construct strong relative pseudocoefficients for some hyperbolic spaces. We establish a toy model for the relative trace formula of H.Jacquet for compact discrete quotient {\Gamma}\G. This allows us to prove that a relative discrete series which admits strong pseudocoefficient with sufficiently small support occurs in the spectral decomposition of L^2({\Gamma}\G) with a nonzero period.
