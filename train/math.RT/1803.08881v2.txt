Let \pi be a simple supercuspidal representation of the symplectic group Sp_{2l}(F), over a p-adic field F. In this work, we explicitly compute the Rankin-Selberg \gamma-factor of rank-1 twists of \pi. We then completely determine the Langlands parameter of \pi, if p \neq 2. In the case that F = \mathbb{Q}_2, we give a conjectural description of the functorial lift of \pi, with which, using a recent work of Bushnell and Henniart, one can obtain its Langlands parameter.
