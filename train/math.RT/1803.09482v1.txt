The work of the first author on the moment map for representations of quivers included a classification of the possible dimension vectors of simple modules for deformed preprojective algebras. That classification was later used to solve an additive analogue of the Deligne-Simpson problem. The last step in the proof of the classification involved some general position arguments; here we give a new approach which avoids such arguments.
