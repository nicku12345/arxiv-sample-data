Let N be a connected and simply connected nilpotent Lie group, and let K be a subgroup of the automorphism group of N. We say that the pair (K,N) is a nilpotent Gelfand pair if L^1_K(N) is an abelian algebra under convolution. In this document we establish a geometric model for the Gelfand spectra of nilpotent Gelfand pairs (K,N) where the K-orbits in the center of N have a one-parameter cross section and satisfy a certain non-degeneracy condition. More specifically, we show that the one-to-one correspondence between the set \Delta(K,N) of bounded K-spherical functions on N and the set \mathcal{A}(K,N) of K-orbits in the dual \mathfrak{n}^* of the Lie algebra for N established by Benson and Ratcliff is a homeomorphism for this class of nilpotent Gelfand pairs. This result had previously been shown for N a free group and N a Heisenberg group, and was conjectured to hold for all nilpotent Gelfand pairs.
