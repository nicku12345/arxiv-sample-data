We prove Lusztig's conjectures {\bf P1}-{\bf P15} for the affine Weyl group of type \tilde{C}_2 for all choices of positive weight function. Our approach to computing Lusztig's \mathbf{a}-function is based on the notion of a `balanced system of cell representations'. Once this system is established roughly half of the conjectures {\bf P1}-{\bf P15} follow. Next we establish an `asymptotic Plancherel Theorem' for type \tilde{C}_2, from which the remaining conjectures follow. Combined with existing results in the literature this completes the proof of Lusztig's conjectures for all rank 1 and 2 affine Weyl groups for all choices of parameters.
