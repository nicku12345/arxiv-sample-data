Let F be a local non-archimedian field and G be the group of F-points of a split connected reductive group over F. In a previous aricle we defined an algebra \mathcal J(G) of functions on G which contains the Hecke algebra \mathcal H(G) and is contained in the Harish-Chandra Schwartz algebra \mathcal C(G). We consider \mathcal J(G) as an algebraic analog the algebra \mathcal C(G). Given a parabolic subgroup P of G with a Levi subgroup M and the unipotent radical U_P we write X_P:=G/U_P. In this paper we study two versions of the Schwartz space of X_P. The first is \mathcal S(X_P):=\mathcal J({\mathcal S} _c(X_P)) and the 2nd is the space spanned by functions of the form \Phi_{Q,P}(\phi) where Q is another parabolic with the same Levi subgroup, \phi\in \mathcal S_c(X_Q) and \Phi_{Q,P} is a normalized intertwining operator from L^2(X_Q) to L^2(X_P). We formulate a series of conjectures about these spaces, for example, we conjecture that \mathcal S'(X_P)\subset \mathcal S(X_P) and that this embedding is an isomorphism on M-cuspidal part. We give a proof of some of our conjectures.
