For an abelian category \mathcal{A}, we define the category PEx(\mathcal{A}) of pullback diagrams of short exact sequences in \mathcal{A}, as a subcategory of the functor category Fun(\Delta, \mathcal{A}) for a fixed diagram category \Delta. For any object M in {\rm PEx}(\mathcal{A}), we prove the existence of a short exact sequence 0 {\to} K {\to} P {\to} M {\to} 0 of functors, where the objects are in PEx(\mathcal{A}) and P(i) \in {\rm Proj(\mathcal{A})} for any i \in \Delta. As an application, we prove that if (\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}, \mathcal{E}) is a triple of syzygy finite classes of objects in \mathrm{mod}\,\Lambda satisfying some special conditions, then \Lambda is an Igusa-Todorov algebra. Finally, we study lower triangular matrix Artin algebras and determine in terms of their components, under reasonable hypothesis, when these algebras are syzygy finite or Igusa-Todorov.
