Following the work of Siddharth Venkatesh, we study the category \textbf{sVec}_2. This category is a proposed candidate for the category of supervector spaces over fields of characteristic 2 (as the ordinary notion of a supervector space does not make sense in charcacteristic 2). In particular, we study commutative algebras in \textbf{sVec}_2, known as d-algebras, which are ordinary associative algebras A together with a linear derivation d:A \to A satisfying the twisted commutativity rule: ab = ba + d(b)d(a). In this paper, we generalize many results from standard commutative algebra to the setting of d-algebras; most notably, we give two proofs of the statement that Artinian d-algebras may be decomposed as a direct product of local d-algebras. In addition, we show that there exists no noncommutative d-algebras of dimension \leq 7, and that up to isomorphism there exists exactly one d-algebra of dimension 7. Finally, we give the notion of a Lie algebra in the category \textbf{sVec}_2, and we state and prove the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for this category.
