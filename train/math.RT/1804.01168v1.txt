We study the cokernel of the application given by the Cartan Matrix C_\Lambda of a finite dimensional k-algebra \Lambda. This produces a finitely generated abelian group, the Cartan group G_\Lambda, which is invariant under derived equivalences. We are interested in the case when G_\Lambda is finite. For a standardly stratified algebra, it is shown that this group is always finite and some interesting connections with the standard modules are found. As a consequence, it is got that G_\Lambda can be seen as a measure of how far is a standardly stratified algebra \Lambda to be quasi-hereditary. Finally, it is also shown that any finite abelian group can be realized as the Cartan group of some standardly stratified algebra.
