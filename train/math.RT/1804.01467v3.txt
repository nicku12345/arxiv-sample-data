Let \ell, n be positive integers such that \ell\geq n. Let \mathbb{G}_{n,\ell} be the Grassmannian which consists of the set of n-dimensional subspaces of \mathbb{C}^{\ell}. There is a \mathbb{Z}-graded algebra isomorphism between the cohomology H^*(\mathbb{G}_{n,\ell},\mathbb{Z}) of \mathbb{G}_{n,\ell} and a natural \mathbb{Z}-form B of the \mathbb{Z}-graded basic algebra of the type A cyclotomic nilHecke algebra H_{\ell,n}^{(0)}=\langle\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_{n-1},y_1,\cdots,y_n\rangle. In this paper, we show that the isomorphism can be chosen such that the image of each (geometrically defined) Schubert class (a_1,\cdots,a_{n}) coincides with the basis element b_{\mathbf{\lambda}} constructed by Jun Hu and Xinfeng Liang by purely algebraic method, where 0\leq a_1\leq a_2\leq\cdots\leq a_{n}\leq \ell-n with a_i\in\mathbb{Z} for each i, \mathbf{\lambda} is the \ell-multipartition of n associated to (\ell+1-(a_{n}+n), \ell+1-(a_{n-1}+n-1),\cdots,\ell+1-(a_1+1)). A similar correspondence between the Schubert class basis of the cohomology of the Grassmannian \mathbb{G}_{\ell-n,\ell} and the b_{\lambda}'s basis of the natural \mathbb{Z}-form B of the \mathbb{Z}-graded basic algebra of H_{\ell,n}^{(0)} is also obtained. As an application, we obtain a second version of Giambelli formula for Schubert classes.
