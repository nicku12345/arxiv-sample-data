We give an interpretation of the map \pi^c defined by Reading, which is a map from the elements of a Coxeter group to the c-sortable elements, in terms of the representation theory of preprojective algebras. Moreover, we study a close relationship between c-sortable elements and torsion pairs, and give an explicit description of the cofinite torsion classes in the context of the Coxeter group. As a consequence, we give a proof of some conjectures proposed by Oppermann, Reiten, and the second author.
