In this paper we show that the leading coefficients \mu(y,w) of some Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials P_{y,w} with y,w in the affine Weyl group of type \widetilde{B_n} can be n; in the cases of types \widetilde{C_n} and \widetilde{D_n} they can be n+1. Consequently, for the corresponding simply connected simple algebraic groups, the dimensions of the first extension groups between certain irreducible modules will go to infinity when n increases.
