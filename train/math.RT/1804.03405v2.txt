In this paper, we study length categories using iterated extensions. We consider the problem of classifying all indecomposable objects in a length category, and the problem of characterizing those length categories that are uniserial. We solve the last problem, and obtain a necessary and sufficient criterion for uniseriality under weak assumptions. This criterion turns out to be known by Amdal and Ringdal already in 1968; we give a new proof that is both elementary and constructive. The first problem is the most fundamental one, and its general solution is "the main and perhaps hopeless purpose of representation theory" according to Gabriel. We solve the problem in the case when the length category is uniserial, using our constructive methods. As an application, we classify all graded holonomic D-modules on a monomial curve over the complex numbers, obtaining the most explicit results over the affine line, when D is the first Weyl algebra. Finally, we show that the iterated extensions are completely determined by the noncommutative deformations of its simple factors. This tells us precisely what we can learn about a length category by studying its species; it gives the tangent space of the noncommutative deformation functor, or the infinitesimal deformations, but not the obstructions for lifting these deformations.
