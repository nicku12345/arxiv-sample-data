In this paper we develop algorithms of finding homogeneous spaces of semisimple non-compact Lie groups which do not admit compact Clifford-Klein forms. We propose a computer program which checks if the given homogeneous space has a non-vanishing cohomological obstruction (found by Tholozan) to compact Clifford-Klein forms. By a numerical experiment we show that there is a large class of homogeneous spaces satisfying Tholozan's condition.
