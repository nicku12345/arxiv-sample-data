We show that the projectivized complex reflection group \Gamma of the unique (1+i)-modular Hermitian \mathbb{Z}[i]-module of signature (9,1) is a new arithmetic reflection group in PU(9,1). We find 32 complex reflections of order four generating \Gamma. The mirrors of these 32 reflections form the vertices of a sort of Coxeter-Dynkin diagram D for \Gamma that encode Coxeter-type generators and relations for \Gamma. The vertices of D can be indexed by sixteen points and sixteen affine hyperplanes in \mathbb{F}_2^4. The edges of D are determined by the finite geometry of these points and hyperplanes. The group of automorphisms of the diagram D is 2^4 \colon (2^3 \colon L_3(2)) \colon 2. This group transitively permutes the 32 mirrors of generating reflections and fixes an unique point \tau in \mathbb{C} H^9. These 32 mirrors are precisely the mirrors closest to \tau. These results are strikingly similar to the results satisfied by the complex hyperbolic reflection group at the center of Allcock's monstrous proposal.
