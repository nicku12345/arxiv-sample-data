This paper is a continuation of two previous papers in MSJ Memoirs, Vol.\,29 (Math. Soc. Japan, 2013) with the same title and numbered as I and II. Based on the hereditary property given there, from mother groups G(m,1,n), the generalized symmetric groups, to child groups G(m,p,n), the complex reflection groups, we study in detail classification and construction of irreducible projective representations (= spin representations) and their characters of G(m,1,n) for n finite. Then, taking limits as n tends to infinity, we obtain spin characters of the inductive limit groups G(m,1,\infty). By the heredity studied further, this gives the main kernel of the results for G(m,p,\infty) with p|m, p>1.
