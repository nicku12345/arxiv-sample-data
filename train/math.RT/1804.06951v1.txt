We classify the blocks, compute the Verma flags of tilting and projective modules in the BGG category \mathcal O for the exceptional Lie superalgebra G(3). The projective injective modules in \mathcal O are classified. We also compute the Jordan-H\"older multiplicities of the Verma modules in \mathcal O.
