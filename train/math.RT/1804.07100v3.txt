In this paper we explicitly construct G_1-intertwining operators between holomorphic discrete series representations \mathcal{H} of a Lie group G and those \mathcal{H}_1 of a subgroup G_1\subset G when (G,G_1) is a symmetric pair of holomorphic type. More precisely, we construct G_1-intertwining projection operators from \mathcal{H} onto \mathcal{H}_1 as differential operators, in the case (G,G_1)=(G_0\times G_0,\Delta G_0) and both \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{H}_1 are of scalar type, and also construct G_1-intertwining embedding operators from \mathcal{H}_1 into \mathcal{H} as infinite-order differential operators, in the case G is simple, \mathcal{H} is of scalar type,and \mathcal{H}_1 is multiplicity-free under a maximal compact subgroup K_1\subset K. In the actual computation we make use of series expansions of integral kernels and the result of Faraut-Kor&#225;nyi (1990) or the author's previous result (2016) on norm computation. As an application, we observe the behavior of residues of the intertwining operators, which define the maps from some subquotient modules, when the parameters are at poles.
