We consider GL_m-dimers of triangulations of regular convex n-gons, which give rise to a dimer model with boundary Q and a dimer algebra \Lambda_Q. Let e_b be the sum of the idempotents of all the boundary vertices, and \mathcal{B}_Q:= e_b \Lambda_Q e_b the associated boundary algebra. In this article we show that given two different triangulations T_1 and T_2 of the n-gon, the boundary algebras are isomorphic, i.e. e_b \Lambda_{Q_{T_1}} e_b \cong e_b \Lambda_{Q_{T_2}} e_b.
