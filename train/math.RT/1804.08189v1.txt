Let \gg be a simple, finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra, and let V^k(\gg) denote the universal affine vertex algebra associated to \gg at level k. The Cartan involution on \gg lifts to an involution on V^k(\gg), and we denote by V^k(\gg)^{\mathbb{Z}_2} the orbifold, or fixed-point subalgebra, under this involution. Our main result is an explicit minimal strong finite generating set for V^k(\gg)^{\mathbb{Z}_2} for generic values of k. In the case \gg = \gs\gl_2, we also determine the set of nongeneric values of k, where this set does not work.
