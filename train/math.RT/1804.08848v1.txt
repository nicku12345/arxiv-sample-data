Recollements of abelian categories are used as a basis of a homological and recursive approach to quasi-hereditary algebras. This yields a homological proof of Dlab and Ringel's characterisation of idempotent ideals occuring in heredity chains, which in turn characterises quasi-hereditary algebras recursively. Further applications are given to hereditary algebras and to Morita context rings.
