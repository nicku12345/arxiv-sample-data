Let {\mathcal O} be an involutive discrete valuation ring with residue field of characteristic not 2. Let A be a quotient of {\mathcal O} by a nonzero power of its maximal ideal and let * be the involution that A inherits from {\mathcal O}. We consider various unitary groups {\mathcal U}_m(A) of rank m over A, depending on the nature of * and the equivalence type of the underlying hermitian or skew hermitian form. Each group {\mathcal U}_m(A) gives rise to a Weil representation.   In this paper, we give a Clifford theory description of all irreducible components of the Weil representation of {\mathcal U}_m(A) with respect to all of its abelian congruence subgroups and a third of its nonabelian congruence subgroups.
