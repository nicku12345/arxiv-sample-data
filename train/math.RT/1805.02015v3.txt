Let \ell be a prime number. We show that the Morita Frobenius number of an \ell-block of a quasi-simple finite group is at most 4 and that the strong Frobenius number is at most 4|D|^2!, where D denotes a defect group of the block. We deduce that a basic algebra of any block of the group algebra of a quasi-simple finite group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic \ell is defined over a field with \ell^a elements for some a \leq 4. We derive consequences for Donovan's conjecture. In particular, we show that Donovan's conjecture holds for \ell-blocks of special linear groups.
