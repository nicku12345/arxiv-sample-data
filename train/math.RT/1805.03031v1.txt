Let G be the real reductive group and let G_0 be the identity component. Let us assume that the unitary dual \hat{G_0} is known. In this paper (in Section 5) the unitary dual \hat{G} is constructed. Automorphisms of G_0 generated by elements of G are the main ingredient of the construction. If the automorphism is outer, one has to consider the corresponding intertwining operators S. Operators S and their properties are analyzed in Section 4. Automorphisms of g_0 are closely related to automorphisms of G_0. They are investigated in Section 3. Automorphisms of so(4,4) are analyzed in Subsection 3.1.
