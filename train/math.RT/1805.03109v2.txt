We study the decomposition as an \textrm{SO}(3)-module of the multiplicity space corresponding to the branching from \textrm{SO}(n+3) to \textrm{SO}(n). Here, \textrm{SO}(n) (resp.\ \textrm{SO}(3)) is considered embedded in \textrm{SO}(n+3) in the upper left-hand block (resp.\ lower right-hand block). We show that when the highest weight of the irreducible representation of \textrm{SO}(n) interlaces the highest weight of the irreducible representation of \textrm{SO}(n+3), then the multiplicity space decomposes as a tensor product of \lfloor (n+2)/2\rfloor reducible representations of \textrm{SO}(3).
