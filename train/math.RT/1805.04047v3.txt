Let E/F be a quadratic extension of finite fields. By a result of Gow, an irreducible representation \pi of G = {\rm GL}_n(E) has at most one non-zero H-invariant vector, up to multiplication by scalars, when H is {\rm GL}_n(F) or {\rm U}(n,E/F). If \pi does have an H-invariant vector it is said to be H-distinguished. It is known, from the work of Gow, that H-distinction is characterized by base change from {\rm U}(n,E/F), due to Kawanaka, when H is {\rm GL}_n(F) (resp. from {\rm GL}_n(F), due to Shintani, when H is {\rm U}(n,E/F)). Assuming \pi is generic and H-distinguished, we give an explicit description of the H-invariant vector in terms of the Bessel function of \pi. Let \psi be a non-degenerate character of N_G/N_H and let B_{\pi,\psi} be the (normalized) Bessel function of \pi on the \psi-Whittaker model. For the H-average \[W_{\pi,\psi} = \frac{1}{|H|} \sum_{h\in H} \pi(h) B_{\pi,\psi}\] of the Bessel function, we prove that \[W_{\pi,\psi}(I_n) = \frac{{\rm dim}\rho}{{\rm dim} \pi} \cdot \frac{|{\rm GL}_n(E)|}{|{\rm GL}_n(F)| |{\rm U}(n,E/F)|},\] where \rho is the representation of {\rm U}(n,E/F) (resp. {\rm GL}_n(F)) that base changes to \pi when H is {\rm GL}_n(F) (resp. {\rm U}(n,E/F)). As an application we classify the members of a generic L-packet of {\rm SL}_n(E) that admit invariant vectors for {\rm SL}_n(F). Finally we prove a p-adic analogue of our result for square-integrable representations in terms of formal degrees by employing the formal degree conjecture of Hiraga-Ichino-Ikeda \cite{hii08}.
