Let G= SL_{n+1} be defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 2. For each n \geq 1 there exists a singular block in the category of G_1-modules which contains precisely n+1 irreducible modules. We are interested in the lift of this block to the category of G_1T-modules. Imposing only mild assumptions on p, we will perform a number of calculations in this setting, including a complete determination of the Loewy series for the baby Verma modules and all possible extensions between the irreducible modules. In the case where p is extremely large, we will also explicitly compute the Loewy series for the indecomposable projective modules.
