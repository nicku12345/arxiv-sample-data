In this paper we construct a family of exact functors from the category of Whittaker modules of the simple complex Lie algebra of type A_n to the category of finite-dimensional modules of the graded affine Hecke algebra of type A_\ell. Using results of Backelin and of Arakawa-Suzuki, we prove that these functors map standard modules to standard modules (or zero) and simple modules to simple modules (or zero). Moreover, we show that each simple module of the graded affine Hecke algebra appears as the image of a simple Whittaker module. Since the Whittaker category contains the BGG category \mathcal{O} as a full subcategory, our results generalize results of Arakawa-Suzuki, which in turn generalize Schur-Weyl duality between finite-dimensional representations of SL_n(\mathbb{C}) and representations of the symmetric group S_n.
