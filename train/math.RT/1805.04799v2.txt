We introduce diagrams for m-cluster categories which we call "horizontal" and "vertical" mutation fans. These are analogous to the mutation fans (also known as "semi-invariant pictures" or "scattering diagrams") for the standard (m=1) cluster case which are dual to the poset of finitely generated torsion classes. The purpose of these diagrams is to visualize mutations and analogues of maximal green sequences in the m-cluster category with special emphasis on the c-vectors (the "brick" labels).
