We establish a new Howe duality between a pair of quantum queer superalgebras (\mathrm{U}_{q^{-1}}(\mathfrak{q}_n), \mathrm{U}_q(\mathfrak{q}_m)). The key ingredient is the construction of a non-commutative analogue \mathcal{A}_q(\mathfrak{q}_n,\mathfrak{q}_m) of the symmetric superalgebra S(\mathbb{C}^{mn|mn}) with the use of quantum coordinate queer superalgebra. It turns out that this superalgebra is equipped with a \mathrm{U}_{q^{-1}}(\mathfrak{q}_n)\otimes\mathrm{U}_q(\mathfrak{q}_m)-supermodule structure that admits a multiplicity-free decomposition. We also show that the (\mathrm{U}_{q^{-1}}(\mathfrak{q}_n),\mathrm{U}_q(\mathfrak{q}_m))-Howe duality implies the Sergeev-Olshanski duality.
