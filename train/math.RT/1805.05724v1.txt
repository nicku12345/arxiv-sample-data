In this paper we study simple transitive 2-representations of certain 2-subcategories of the 2-category of projective functors over a star algebra. We show that in the simplest case, which is associated to the Dynkin type A_2, simple transitive 2-representations are classified by cell 2-representations. In the general case we conjecture that there exist many simple transitive 2-representations which are not cell 2-representations and provide some evidence for our conjecture.
