In this paper, we define the concept of the Study-type determinant, and we present some properties of these determinants. These properties lead to some properties of the Study determinant. The properties of the Study-type determinants are obtained using a commutative diagram. This diagram leads not only to these properties, but also to an inequality for the degrees of representations and to an extension of Dedekind's theorem.
