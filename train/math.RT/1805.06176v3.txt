We investigate the structure and properties of an Artinian monomial complete intersection quotient A(n,d)=\mathbf{k} [x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}] \big / (x_{1}^{d}, \ldots, x_{n}^d). We construct explicit homogeneous bases of A(n,d) that are compatible with the S_{n}-module structure for n=3, all exponents d \ge 3 and all homogeneous degrees j \ge 0. Moreover, we derive the multiplicity formulas, both in recursive form and in closed form, for each irreducible component appearing in the S_{3}-module decomposition of homogeneous subspaces. 4, 5.
