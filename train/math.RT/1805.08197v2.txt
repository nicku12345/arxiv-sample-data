Kleinian singularities, i.e., the varieties corresponding to the algebras of invariants of Kleinian groups are of fundamental importance for Algebraic geometry, Representation theory and Singularity theory. The filtered deformations of these algebras of invariants were classified by Slodowy (the commutative case) and Losev (the general case). To an inclusion of Kleinian groups, there is the corresponding inclusion of algebras of invariants. We classify deformations of these inclusions when a smaller subgroup is normal in the larger.
