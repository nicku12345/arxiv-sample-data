We solve two problems in representation theory for the periplectic Lie superalgebra pe(n), namely the description of the primitive spectrum in terms of functorial realisations of the braid group and the decomposition of category O into indecomposable blocks.   To solve the first problem we establish a new type of equivalence between category O for all (not just simple or basic) classical Lie superalgebras and a category of Harish-Chandra bimodules. The latter bimodules have a left action of the Lie superalgebra but a right action of the underlying Lie algebra. To solve the second problem we establish a BGG reciprocity result for the periplectic Lie superalgebra.
