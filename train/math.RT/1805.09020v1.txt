Let G = GL(V) for an N-dimensional vector space V over an algebraically closed field k, and G^{\theta} the fixed point subgroup of G under an involution \theta on G. In the case where G^{\theta} = O(V), the generalized Springer correspondence for the unipotent variety of the symmetric space G/G^{\theta} was studied by last two authors, under the assumption that ch k is odd. The definition of \theta, and of the associated symmetric space given there make sense even if ch k = 2. In this paper, we discuss the Springer correspondence for those symmetric spaces of even characteristic. We show that if N is even, the Springer correspondence is reduced to that of symplectic Lie algebras in ch k = 2, which was determined by Xue. While if N is odd, we show that a very similar phenomenon as in the case of exotic symmetric space of level 3 appears.
