An Artin algebra \Lambda is said to be of finite Cohen-Macaulay type, \rm{CM}-finite for short, if the full subcategory \rm{Gprj}\mbox{-} \Lambda of finitely generated Gorenstein projective \Lambda-modules is of finite representation type. If \Lambda is a \rm{CM}-finite algebra, then we denote by \rm{Aus}(\underline{\rm{Gprj}}\mbox{-} \Lambda) the stable Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebra, i.e. \rm{\underline{End}}_{\Lambda}(G), where G  is a basic representation generator of \rm{Gprj}\mbox{-}\Lambda. In this paper, we will explain how by defining an equivalence relation on the elements of algebra \rm{Aus}(\underline{\rm{Gprj}}\mbox{-} \Lambda) can be used to give a characterization for \rm{Aus}(\underline{\rm{Gprj}}\mbox{-} \Lambda) to be of finite representation type, or equivalently, the \rm{CM}-finiteness of the algebra of 2 \times 2 lower triangular matrices over \Lambda, where \Lambda is a \rm{CM}-finite Artin algebra over an algebraic closed filed. Then, by presenting some examples we will show how our results work.
