We develop a theory of microlocalization for Harish-Chandra modules, adapting a construction of Losev (\cite{Losev2011}). We explore the applications of this theory to unipotent representations. We observe that the machinery of microlocalization provides an alternative characterization of unipotent representations. For G_{\mathbb{R}} complex (and under a codimension condition on \partial \mathcal{O}), we deduce a formula for the K-multiplicities of unipotent representations attached to a nilpotent orbit \mathcal{O}, proving an old conjecture of Vogan (\cite{Vogan1991}) in a large family of cases.
