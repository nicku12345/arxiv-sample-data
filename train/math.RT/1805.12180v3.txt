Given n\leq d<\infty, we investigate the existence of algebras of global dimension d which admit an n-cluster tilting subcategory. We construct many such examples using representation-directed algebras. First, given two representation-directed algebras A and B, a projective A-module P and an injective B-module I satisfying certain conditions, we show how we can construct a new representation-directed algebra \Lambda in such a way that the representation theory of \Lambda is completely described by the representation theories of A and B. Next we introduce n-fractured subcategories which generalize n-cluster tilting subcategories for representation-directed algebras. We then show how one can construct an n-cluster tilting subcategory for \Lambda by using n-fractured subcategories of A and B. As an application of our construction, we show that if n is odd and d\geq n then there exists an algebra admitting an n-cluster tilting subcategory and having global dimension d. We show the same result if n is even and d is odd or d\geq 2n.
