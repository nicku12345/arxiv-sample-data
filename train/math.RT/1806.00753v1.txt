In this paper, we investigate the tensor structure of the category of finite dimensional weight modules over the Hopf-Ore extensions kG(\chi^{-1}, a, 0) of group algebras kG. The tensor product decomposition rules for all indecomposable weight modules are explicitly given under the assumptions that k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and the orders of \chi and \chi(a) are the same.
