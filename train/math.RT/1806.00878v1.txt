The coideal subalgebra of the quantum \mathfrak{sl}_2 is a polynomial algebra in a generator t which depends on a parameter \kappa. The existence of the \imath-canonical basis (also known as the \imath-divided powers) for the coideal subalgebra of the quantum \mathfrak{sl}_2 were established by Bao and Wang. We establish closed formulae for the \imath-divided powers as polynomials in t and also in terms of Chevalley generators of the quantum \mathfrak{sl}_2 when the parameter \kappa is an arbitrary q-integer. The formulae were known earlier when \kappa=0,1.
