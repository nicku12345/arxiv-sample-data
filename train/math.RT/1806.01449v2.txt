K. Igusa and G. Todorov introduced the \varphi function which generalizes the notion of projective dimension. We study the behavior of the \varphi function for cyclic Nakayama algebras of infinite global dimension. We prove that the supremum of values of \varphi is always an even number. In particular we show that the \varphi-dimension is 2 if and only if the algebra satisfies certain symmetry conditions. Also we give a sharp upper bound for \varphi-dimension in terms of the number of monomial relations which describes the algebra.
