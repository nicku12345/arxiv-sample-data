As a first application of the double affine Hecke algebra with unequal parameters on Weyl orbits to representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras, we find the graded multiplicities of the trivial module and of the little adjoint module in the exterior algebra of the little adjoint module of a simple Lie algebra \,\mathfrak{g}\, with a non-simply laced Dynkin diagram. We prove that in type \,B, C\, or \,F\, these multiplicities can be expressed in terms of special exponents of positive long roots in the dual root system of \,\mathfrak{g}.\,
