The tables of this title are a first attempt to understand empirically the sizes of certain distinguished sets, introduced by Hankyung Ko, of elements in affine Weyl groups. The sizes are relevant to the computational efficiency of direct approaches to computing characters of modular representations of algebraic groups from characters of corresponding irreducible representations of quantum groups.
