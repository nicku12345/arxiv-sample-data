We present a conjecture on multiplicity of irreducible representations of a subgroup H contained in the irreducible representations of a group G, with G and H having the same derived groups. We point out some consequences of the conjecture, and verification of some of the consequences. We give an explicit example of multiplicity 2 upon restriction, as well as certain theorems in the context of classical groups where the multiplicity is 1.
