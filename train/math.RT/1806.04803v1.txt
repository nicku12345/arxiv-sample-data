One-parameter criterion for 2-equipped posets with respect to cerepresentations is stated and proved. The list of sincere one-parameter 2-equipped posets is given as well as a complex matrix classification of all their indecomposables corepresentations. Relations between dimensions of indecoposable corepresentations and roots of the Tits quadratic form are also established.
