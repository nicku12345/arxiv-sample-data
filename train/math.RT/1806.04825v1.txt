We study {\rm Sp}_{2n}(F)-distinction for representations of the quasi-split unitary group U_{2n}(E/F) in 2n variables with respect to a quadratic extension E/F of p-adic fields. A conjecture of Dijols and Prasad predicts that no tempered representation is distinguished. We verify this for a large family of representations in terms of the Moeglin-Tadic classification of the discrete series. We further study distinction for some families of non-tempered representations. In particular, we exhibit L-packets with no distinguished members that transfer under stable base change to {\rm Sp}_{2n}(E)-distinguished representations of {\rm GL}_{2n}(E).
