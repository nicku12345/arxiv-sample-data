In this survey paper we give an overview of a generalization, introduced by R. Bautista and the author, of the theory of mutation of quivers with potential developed in 2007 by Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky. This new construction allows us to consider finite dimensional semisimple F-algebras, where F is any field. We give a brief account of the results concerning this generalization and its main consequences.
