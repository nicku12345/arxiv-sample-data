Many tight frames of interest are constructed via their Gramian matrix (which determines the frame up to unitary equivalence). Given such a Gramian, it can be determined whether or not the tight frame is projective group frame, i.e., is the projective orbit of some group G (which may not be unique). On the other hand, there is complete description of the projective group frames in terms of the irreducible projective representations of G. Here we consider the inverse problem of taking the Gramian of a projective group frame for a group G, and identifying the cocycle and constructing the frame explicitly as the projective group orbit of a vector v (decomposed in terms of the irreducibles). The key idea is to recognise that the Gramian is a group matrix given by a vector f\in\mathbb{C}^G, and to take the Fourier transform of f to obtain the components of v as orthogonal projections. This requires the development of a theory of group matrices and the Fourier transform for projective representations. Of particular interest, we give a block diagonalisation of (projective) group matrices. This leads to a unique Fourier decomposition of the group matrices, and a further fine-scale decomposition into low rank group matrices.
