The Peter-Weyl idempotent e_{\mathcal{P}} of a parahoric subgroup {\mathcal{P}} is the sum of the idempotents of irreducible representations of \mathcal{P} which have a nonzero Iwahori fixed vector. The convolution algebra associated to e_{\mathcal{P}} is called a Peter-Weyl Iwahori algebra. We show any Peter-Weyl Iwahori algebra is Morita equivalent to the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. Both the Iwahori-Hecke algebra and a Peter-Weyl Iwahori algbera have a natural \mathbb{C}^\star-algebra structure, and the Morita equivalence preserves irreducible hermitian and unitary modules. Both algebras have another anti-involution denoted as \bullet, and the Morita equivalence preserves irreducible and unitary modules for the \bullet-involution.
