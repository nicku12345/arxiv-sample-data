In this paper we prove, for G a connected reductive algebraic group satisfying a technical assumption, that the Satake category of G (with coefficients in a finite field, a finite extension of Q_l, or the ring of integers of such a field) can be described via Iwahori-Whittaker perverse sheaves on the affine Grassmannian. As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Juteau-Mautner-Williamson describing the tilting objects in the Satake category.
