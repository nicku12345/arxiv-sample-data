The purpose of this paper is to define a set of representations of Sp(p,q) and SO*(2n), the unipotent representations of the title, and establish their unitarity. The unipotent representations considered here properly contain the special unipotent representations of Arthur and Barbasch-Vogan; in particular we settle the unitarity of special unipotent representations for these groups.
