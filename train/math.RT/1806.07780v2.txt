In this paper, we carry out several computations involving graded (or \mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{m}}-equivariant) perverse-coherent sheaves on the nilpotent cone of a reductive group in good characteristic. In the first part of the paper, we compute the weight of the \mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{m}}-action on certain normalized (or "canonical") simple objects, confirming an old prediction of Ostrik. In the second part of the paper, we explicitly describe all simple perverse coherent sheaves for G = PGL_3, in every characteristic other than 2 or 3. Applications include an explicit description of the cohomology of tilting modules for the corresponding quantum group, as well as a proof that \mathsf{PCoh}^{\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{m}}}(\mathcal{N}) never admits a positive grading when the characteristic of the field is greater than 3.
