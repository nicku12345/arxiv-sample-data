We study K-types of degenerate principal series of {\rm Sp}(n,\mathbb{C}) by using two realisations of these infinite-dimensional representations. The first model we use is the classical compact picture; the second model is conjugate to the non-compact picture via an appropriate partial Fourier transform. In the first case we find a family of K-finite vectors that can be expressed as solutions of specific hypergeometric differential equations; the second case leads to a family of K-finite vectors whose expressions involve Bessel functions.
