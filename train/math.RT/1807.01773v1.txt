A positive level Kazhdan-Lusztig functor is defined using Arkhipov-Gaitsgory duality for affine Lie algebras. The functor sends objects in the DG category of G(O)-equivariant positive level affine Lie algebra modules to objects in the DG category of modules over Lusztig's quantum group at a root of unity. We prove that the semi-infinite cohomology functor for positive level modules factors through the Kazhdan-Lusztig functor at positive level and the quantum group cohomology functor with respect to the positive part of Lusztig's quantum group.
