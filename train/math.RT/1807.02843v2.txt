For a locally compact, totally disconnected group G, a subgroup H and a character \chi:H \to \mathbb{C}^{\times} we define a Hecke algebra \mathcal{H}_\chi and explore the connection between commutativity of \mathcal{H}_\chi and the \chi-Gelfand property of (G,H), i.e. the property \mathrm{dim}_\mathbb{C}(\rho^*)^{(H,\chi^{-1})} \leq 1 for every \rho \in \mathrm{Irr}(G), the irreducible representations of G.   We show that the conditions of the Gelfand-Kazhdan criterion imply commutativity of \mathcal{H}_\chi, and verify in several simple cases that commutativity of \mathcal{H}_\chi is equivalent to the \chi-Gelfand property of (G,H).   We then show that if G is a connected reductive group over a p-adic field F, and G/H is F-spherical, then the cuspidal part of \mathcal{H}_\chi is commutative if and only if (G,H) satisfies the \chi-Gelfand property with respect to all cuspidal representations {\rho \in \mathrm{Irr}(G)}.   We conclude by showing that if (G,H) satisfies the \chi-Gelfand property with respect to all irreducible (H,\chi^{-1})-tempered representations of G then \mathcal{H}_\chi is commutative.
