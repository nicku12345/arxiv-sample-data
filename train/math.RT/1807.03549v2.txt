We study the structure of bounded simple weight \mathfrak{sl}(\infty)-, \mathfrak{o}(\infty)-, \mathfrak{sp}(\infty)-modules, which have been recently classified in [6]. Given a splitting parabolic subalgebra \mathfrak{p} of \mathfrak{sl}(\infty), \mathfrak{o}(\infty), \mathfrak{sp}(\infty), we introduce the concepts of \mathfrak{p}-aligned and pseudo \mathfrak{p}-aligned \mathfrak{sl}(\infty)-, \mathfrak{o}(\infty)-, \mathfrak{sp}(\infty)-modules, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for bounded simple weight modules to be \mathfrak{p}-aligned or pseudo \mathfrak{p}-aligned. The existence of pseudo \mathfrak{p}-aligned modules is a consequence of the fact that the Lie algebras considered have infinite rank.
