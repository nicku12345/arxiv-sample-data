We prove that the tensor product of a simple and a finite dimensional \mathfrak{sl}_n-module has finite type socle. This is applied to reduce classification of simple \mathfrak{q}(n)-supermodules to that of simple \mathfrak{sl}_n-modules. Rough structure of simple \mathfrak{q}(n)-supermodules, considered as \mathfrak{sl}_n-modules, is described in terms of the combinatorics of category \mathcal{O}.
