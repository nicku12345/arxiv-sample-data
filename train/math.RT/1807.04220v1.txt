We construct a family of twisted generalized Weyl algebras which includes Weyl-Clifford superalgebras and quotients of the enveloping algebras of \mathfrak{gl}(m|n) and \mathfrak{osp}(m|2n). We give a condition for when a canonical representation by differential operators is faithful. Lastly, we give a description of the graded support of these algebras in terms of pattern-avoiding vector compositions.
