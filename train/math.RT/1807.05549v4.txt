We construct and study a nested sequence of finite symmetric tensor categories {\rm Vec}=\mathcal{C}_0\subset \mathcal{C}_1\subset\cdots\subset \mathcal{C}_n\subset\cdots over a field of characteristic 2 such that \mathcal{C}_{2n} are incompressible, i.e., do not admit tensor functors into tensor categories of smaller Frobenius--Perron dimension. This generalizes the category \mathcal{C}_1 described by Venkatesh and the category \mathcal{C}_2 defined by Ostrik. The Grothendieck rings of the categories \mathcal{C}_{2n} and \mathcal{C}_{2n+1} are both isomorphic to the ring of real cyclotomic integers defined by a primitive 2^{n+2}-th root of unity, \mathcal{O}_n=\mathbb Z[2\cos(\pi/2^{n+1})].
