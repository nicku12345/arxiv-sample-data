Let \mathfrak{o} be the ring of integers of a non-Archimedean local field F with finite residue field of even characteristic and maximal ideal \mathfrak{p}. Let \mathrm{e}(\mathfrak{o}) denotes the ramification index of \mathfrak{o} in case \mathfrak{o} has characteristic zero. We prove that the abscissa of convergence of representation zeta function of Special Linear group \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathfrak{o}) is 1. We prove that for any \mathfrak{o} of characteristic zero with the residue field of cardinality q such that 2 \mid q the group algebras \mathbb C[\mathrm{SL}_2( \mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}^{2 r})] and \mathbb C[\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb F_q[t]/(t^{2r}))] are not isomorphic for any r > \mathrm{e}(\mathfrak{o}). Further we give a construction of all primitive irreducible representations of groups \mathrm{SL}_2\left (\mathbb F_q[t]/(t^{2r}) \right)  for all r \geq 1 and of groups \mathrm{SL}_2( \mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}^{2 r}), where \mathfrak{o} has characteristic zero and r \geq 2\mathrm{e}(\mathfrak{o}).
