This paper simplifies and further develops various aspects of Tasho Kaletha's construction of regular supercuspidal representations. Moreover, Kaletha's construction is connected with the author's revision of Yu's construction of tame supercuspidal representations. This allows for a more direct construction of regular supercuspidal representations that is more amenable to applications.
