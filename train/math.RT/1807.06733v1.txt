Let \C be an (n+2)-angulated category with shift functor \Sigma and \X be a cluster-tilting subcategory of \C. Then we show that the quotient category \C/\X is an n-abelian category. If \C has a Serre functor, then \C/\X is equivalent to an n-cluster tilting subcategory of an abelian category \textrm{mod}(\Sigma^{-1}\X). Moreover, we also prove that \textrm{mod}(\Sigma^{-1}\X) is Gorenstein of Gorenstein dimension at most n. As an application, we generalize recent results of Jacobsen-J{\o}rgensen and Koenig-Zhu.
