A celebrated result by Keller--Reiten says that 2-Calabi--Yau tilted algebras are Gorenstein and stably 3-Calabi--Yau. This note shows that the converse holds in the monomial case: a 1-Gorenstein monomial algebra with a 3-Calabi--Yau singularity category is 2-Calabi--Yau tilted. We study the case of other Goresntein monomial algebras with stably Calabi--Yau singularity categories.
