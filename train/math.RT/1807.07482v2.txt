Let F/F_0 be a quadratic extension of non-Archimedean locally compact fields of residual characteristic p\neq2, and let \sigma denote its non-trivial automorphism. Let R be an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from p. To any cuspidal representation \pi of {\rm GL}_n(F), with coefficients in R, such that \pi^{\sigma}\simeq\pi^{\vee} (such a representation is said to be \sigma-selfdual) we associate a quadratic extension D/D_0, where D is a tamely ramified extension of F and D_0 is a tamely ramified extension of F_0, together with a quadratic character of D_0^{\times}. When \pi is supercuspidal, we give a necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of these data, for \pi to be {\rm GL}_n(F_0)-distinguished. When the characteristic \ell of R is not 2, denoting by \omega the non-trivial R-character of F_0^{\times} trivial on F/F_0-norms, we prove that any \sigma-selfdual supercuspidal R-representation is either distinguished or \omega-distinguished, but not both. In the modular case, that is when \ell>0, we give examples of \sigma-selfdual cuspidal non-supercuspidal representations which are not distinguished nor \omega-distinguished. In the particular case where R is the field of complex numbers, in which case all cuspidal representations are supercuspidal, this gives a complete distinction criterion for arbitrary complex cuspidal representations, as well as a purely local proof, for cuspidal representations, of the dichotomy and disjunction theorem due to Kable and Anandavardhanan-Kable-Tandon.
