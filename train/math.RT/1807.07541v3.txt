Given a unimodular real spherical space Z=G/H we construct for each boundary degeneration Z_I=G/H_I of Z a Bernstein morphism B_I: L^2(Z_I)_{\rm disc }\to L^2(Z). We show that B:=\bigoplus_I B_I provides an isospectral G-equivariant morphism onto L^2(Z). Further, the maps B_I are finite linear combinations of orthogonal projections which translates in the known cases where Z is a group or a symmetric space into the familiar Maass-Selberg relations. As a corollary we obtain that L^2(Z)_{\rm disc }\neq \emptyset provided that {\mathfrak h}^\perp contains elliptic elements in its interior.
