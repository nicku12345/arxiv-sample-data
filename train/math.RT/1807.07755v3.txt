Let F/F_{\mathsf{o}} be a quadratic extension of non-archimedean locally compact fields of odd residual characteristic and \sigma be its non-trivial automorphism. We show that any \sigma-self-dual cuspidal representation of {\rm GL}_n(F) contains a \sigma-self-dual Bushnell--Kutzko type. Using such a type, we construct an explicit test vector for Flicker's local Asai L-function of a {\rm GL}_n(F_{\mathsf{o}})-distinguished cuspidal representation and compute the associated Asai root number. Finally, by using global methods, we compare this root number to Langlands--Shahidi's local Asai root number, and more generally we compare the corresponding epsilon factors for any cuspidal representation.
