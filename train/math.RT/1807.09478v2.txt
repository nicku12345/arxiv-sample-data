We study stabilization of finite-dimensional representations of the periplectic Lie superalgebras \mathfrak{p}(n) as n \to \infty.   The paper gives a construction of the tensor category Rep(\underline{P}), possessing nice universal properties among tensor categories over the category \mathtt{sVect} of finite-dimensional complex vector superspaces.   First, it is the "abelian envelope" of the Deligne category corresponding to the periplectic Lie superalgebra, in the sense of arXiv:1511.07699.   Secondly, given a tensor category \mathcal{C} over \mathtt{sVect}, exact tensor functors Rep(\underline{P})\longrightarrow \mathcal{C} classify pairs (X, \omega) in \mathcal{C} where \omega: X \otimes X \to \Pi \mathbf{1} is a non-degenerate symmetric form and X not annihilated by any Schur functor.   The category Rep(\underline{P}) is constructed in two ways. The first construction is through an explicit limit of the tensor categories Rep(\mathfrak{p}(n)) (n\geq 1) under Duflo-Serganova functors. The second construction (inspired by P. Etingof) describes Rep(\underline{P}) as the category of representations of a periplectic Lie supergroup in the Deligne category \mathtt{sVect} \boxtimes Rep(\underline{GL}_t).   An upcoming paper by the authors will give results on the abelian and tensor structure of Rep(\underline{P}).
