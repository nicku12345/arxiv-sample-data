In this article we study quotients of deformations of simple singularities, and attempt to characterize them in terms of subsystems of simple root systems. The quotient of a semiuniversal deformation of a simple singularity of inhomogeneous type B_r (r \geq 2), C_r (r \geq 3), F_4 or G_2 by the natural symmetry of the associated Dynkin diagram is a deformation of a simple singularity of homogeneous type X = D_s, E_6 or E_7, but not semiuniversal anymore. Therefore not all subdiagrams of X appear as singular configurations of the fibers of the deformation. We propose a conjecture for the types of singular configurations in terms of sub-root systems of a root system of type X. The conjecture is then proved for the types B_2, B_3, C_3, F_4 and G_2.
