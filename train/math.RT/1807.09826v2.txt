We show that in case a cluster algebra coincides with its upper cluster algebra and the cluster algebra admits a grading with finite dimensional homogeneous components, the corresponding Berenstein-Zelevinsky quantum cluster algebra can be viewed as a flat deformation of the classical cluster algebra.
