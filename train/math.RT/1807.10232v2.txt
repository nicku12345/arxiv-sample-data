Hiraga, Ichino and Ikeda have conjectured an explicit expression for the Plancherel density of the group of points of a reductive group defined over a local field F, in terms of local Langlands parameters. In these lectures we shall present a proof of these conjectures for Lusztig's class of representations of unipotent reduction if F is p-adic and G is of adjoint type and splits over an unramified extension of F. This is based on the author's paper [Spectral transfer morphisms for unipotent affine Hecke algebras, Selecta Math. (N.S.) 22 (2016), no. 4, 2143--2207].   More generally for G connected reductive (still assumed to be split over an unramified extension of F), we shall show that the requirement of compatibility with the conjectures of Hiraga, Ichino and Ikeda essentially determines the Langlands parameterisation for tempered representations of unipotent reduction. We shall show that there exist parameterisations for which the conjectures of Hiraga, Ichino and Ikeda hold up to rational constant factors. The main technical tool is that of spectral transfer maps between normalised affine Hecke algebras used in op. cit.
