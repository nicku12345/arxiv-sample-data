Let \mathbb{H}_n be the (2n+1)-dimensional Heisenberg group and K a closed subgroup of U(n) acting on \mathbb{H}_n by automorphisms such that (K,\mathbb{H}_n) is a Gelfand pair. Let G=K\ltimes\mathbb{H}_n be the semidirect product of K and \mathbb{H}_n. Let \mathfrak{g}\supset\mathfrak{k} be the respective Lie algebras of G and K, and \operatorname{pr}: \mathfrak{g}^{*}\longrightarrow\mathfrak{k}^{*} the natural projection. For coadjoint orbits \mathcal{O}^{G}\subset\mathfrak{g}^{*} and \mathcal{O}^{K}\subset\mathfrak{k}^{*}, we denote by n\big(\mathcal{O}^{G},\mathcal{O}^{K}\big) the number of K-orbits in \mathcal{O}^{G}\cap \operatorname{pr}^{-1}(\mathcal{O}^{K}), which is called the Corwin-Greenleaf multiplicity function. In this paper, we give two sufficient conditions on \mathcal{O}^G in order that n\big(\mathcal{O}^G,\mathcal{O}^K\big)\leq 1\:\:\text{for any K-coadjoint orbit}\:\:\mathcal{O}^{K}\subset\mathfrak{k}^{*}. For K=U(n), assuming furthermore that \mathcal{O}^{G} and \mathcal{O}^{K} are admissible and denoting respectively by \pi and \tau their corresponding irreducible unitary representations, we also discuss the relationship between n\big(\mathcal{O}^G,\mathcal{O}^K\big) and the multiplicity m(\pi,\tau) of \tau in the restriction of \pi to K. Especially, we study in Theorem 4 the case where n(\mathcal{O}^{G},\mathcal{O}^{K})\neq m(\pi,\tau). This inequality is interesting because we expect the equality as the naming of the Corwin-Greenleaf multiplicity function suggests.
