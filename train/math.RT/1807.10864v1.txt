Let G=K\ltimes\mathbb{R}^n, where K is a compact connected subgroup of O(n) acting on \mathbb{R}^n by rotations. Let \mathfrak{g}\supset\mathfrak{k} be the respective Lie algebras of G and K, and pr: \mathfrak{g}^{*}\longrightarrow\mathfrak{k}^{*} the natural projection. For admissible coadjoint orbits \mathcal{O}^{G}\subset\mathfrak{g}^{*} and \mathcal{O}^{K}\subset\mathfrak{k}^{*}, we denote by n(\mathcal{O}^{G},\mathcal{O}^{K}) the number of K-orbits in \mathcal{O}^{G}\cap pr^{-1}(\mathcal{O}^{K}), which is called the Corwin-Greenleaf multiplicity function. Let \pi\in\widehat{G} and \tau\in\widehat{K} be the unitary representations corresponding, respectively, to \mathcal{O}^G and \mathcal{O}^K by the orbit method. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between n(\mathcal{O}^G,\mathcal{O}^K) and the multiplicity m(\pi,\tau) of \tau in the restriction of \pi to K. If \pi is infinite-dimensional and the associated little group is connected, we show that n(\mathcal{O}^G,\mathcal{O}^K)\neq 0 if and only if m(\pi,\tau)\neq 0. Furthermore, for K=SO(n), n\geq 3, we give a sufficient condition on the representations \pi and \tau in order that n(\mathcal{O}^G,\mathcal{O}^K)=m(\pi,\tau).
