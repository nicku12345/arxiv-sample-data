Let \Lambda be a \mathbb{Z}-graded artin algebra. Two classical results of Gordon and Green state that if \Lambda has only finitely many indecomposable gradable modules, up to isomorphism, then \Lambda has finite representation type, and if \Lambda has finite representation type then every \Lambda-module is gradable. We generalize these results to \mathbb{Z}-graded right artinian rings R. The key tool is a characterization of gradable modules: a f.g. right R-module is gradable if and only if its "pull-up" is pure-projective. Using this we show that if there is a bound on the graded-lengths of f.g. indecomposable graded R-modules, then every f.g. R-module is gradable. As another consequence, we see that if a graded artin algebra has an ungradable module, then it has a Pr\"ufer module which is not of finite type, and hence it has a generic module by work of Ringel
