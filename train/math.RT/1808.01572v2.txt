In this paper we introduce two general identities relating Eisenstein series on split classical groups, as well as double covers of symplectic groups. The first identity can be viewed as an extension of the doubling construction introduced in [CFGK17]. The second identity is a generalization of the descent construction studied in [GRS11].
