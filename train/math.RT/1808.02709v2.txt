Let \Phi be a finite dimensional algebra over a field k. Kleiner described the Auslander-Reiten sequences in a precovering extension closed subcategory \mathcal{X}\subseteq mod \Phi. If X\in\mathcal{X} is an indecomposable such that Ext_{\Phi}^1(X,\mathcal{X})\neq 0 and \zeta X is the unique indecomposable direct summand of the \mathcal{X}-cover g:Y\rightarrow DTrX such that Ext_{\Phi}^1(X,\zeta X)\neq 0, then there is an Auslander-Reiten sequence in \mathcal{X} of the form   \begin{align*}   \epsilon: 0\rightarrow \zeta X\rightarrow X'\rightarrow X\rightarrow 0.   \end{align*}   Moreover, when End_\Phi (X) modulo the morphisms factoring through a projective is a division ring, Kleiner proved that each non-split short exact sequence of the form   \begin{align*}   \delta: 0\rightarrow Y\rightarrow Y'\xrightarrow{\eta} X\rightarrow 0   \end{align*} is such that \eta is right almost split in \mathcal{X}, and the pushout of \delta along g gives an Auslander-Reiten sequence in mod \Phi ending at X.   In this paper, we give higher dimensional generalisations of this. Let d\geq 1 be an integer. A d-cluster tilting subcategory \mathcal{F}\subseteq mod \Phi plays the role of a higher mod \Phi. Such an \mathcal{F} is a d-abelian category, where kernels and cokernels are replaced by complexes of d objects and short exact sequences by complexes of d+2 objects. We give higher versions of the above results for an additive "d-extension closed" subcategory \mathcal{X} of \mathcal{F}.
