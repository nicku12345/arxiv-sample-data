We construct a supercharacter theory, and establish the supercharacter table for Sylow p-subgroups G_2^{syl}(q) of the Chevalley groups G_2(q) of Lie type G_2 when p>2. Then we calculate the conjugacy classes, determine the complex irreducible characters by Clifford theory, and obtain the character tables for G_2^{syl}(q) when p>3.
