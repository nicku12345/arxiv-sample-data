In this paper, we establish a Whittaker-Plancherel inversion formula for \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) from the analytic perspective of the Bessel transform of Bruggeman and Motohashi. The formula gives a decomposition of the Whittaker-Fourier coefficient of a compactly supported function on \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) in terms of its Bessel coefficients attached to irreducible unitary tempered representations of \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}).
