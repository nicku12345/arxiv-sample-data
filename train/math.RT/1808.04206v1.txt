The symplectic blob algebra b_n (n \in \mathbb{N}) is a finite dimensional algebra defined by a multiplication rule on a basis of certain diagrams. The rank r(n) of b_n is not known in general, but   r(n)/n grows unboundedly with n. For each b_n we define an algebra by presentation, such that the number of generators and relations grows linearly with n. We prove that these algebras are isomorphic.
