In this paper, we use the theory of algebraic groups to prove a number of new and fundamental results about the orthogonal Gelfand-Zeitlin system. We show that the moment map (orthogonal Kostant-Wallach map) is surjective and simplify criteria of Kostant and Wallach for an element to be strongly regular. We further prove the integrability of the orthogonal Gelfand-Zeitlin system on regular adjoint orbits and describe the generic flows of the integrable system. We also study the nilfibre of the moment map and show that in contrast to the general linear case it contains no strongly regular elements. This extends results of Kostant, Wallach, and Colarusso from the general linear case to the orthogonal case.
