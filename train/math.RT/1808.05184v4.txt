For a path algebra A over a quiver Q, there are bijections between the support-tilting modules of A, torsion classes in \mathrm{mod}(A) and wide subcategories in \mathrm{mod}(A); these are part of the Ingalls-Thomas bijections. As a blueprint for further study, we show how these bijections manifest themselves for higher Auslander algebras of linearly oriented type A. In particular, we introduce a higher analogue of torsion classes in d-representation-finite algebras.
