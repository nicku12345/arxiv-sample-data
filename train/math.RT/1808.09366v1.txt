We construct a few supercharacter theories for finite semidirect products with the normal subgroup of algebra group type. In the case of algebra groups, these supercharacter theories coincide with the one of P.Diaconis and I.M.Isaaks. For the parabolic subgroups of GL(n), the supercharacters and superclasses are classified.
