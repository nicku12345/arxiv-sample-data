Attached to any reductive Lie group G is a "Cartan motion group" G_0 - a Lie group with the same dimension as G, but a simpler group structure. A natural one-to-one correspondence between the irreducible tempered representations of G and the unitary irreducible representations of G_0, whose existence had been suggested by Mackey in the 1970s, has recently been described by the author. In the present notes, we use the existence of a family of groups interpolating between G and G_0 to realize the bijection as a deformation: for every irreducible tempered representation \pi of G, we build, in an appropriate Fr\'echet space, a family of subspaces and evolution operators that contract \pi onto the corresponding representation of G_0.
