In this paper we give Peter-Weyl type formulas for the space of K-finite solutions to intertwining differential operators between degenerate principal series representations. Our results generalize a result of Kable for conformally invariant systems. The main idea is based on the duality theorem between intertwining differential operators and homomorphisms between generalized Verma modules. As an application we uniformly realize on the solution spaces of intertwining differential operators all small representations of \widetilde{SL}(3,\mathbb{R}) attached to the minimal nilpotent orbit.
