Let (G,G^\Gamma) be a Klein four symmetric pair. The author wants to classify all the Klein four symmetric pairs (G,G^\Gamma) such that there exists at least one nontrivial unitarizable simple (\mathfrak{g},K)-module \pi_K that is discretely decomposable as a (\mathfrak{g}^\Gamma,K^\Gamma)-module. In this article, three assumptions will be made. Firstly, G is an exceptional Lie group of Hermitian type, i.e., G=\mathrm{E}_{6(-14)} or \mathrm{E}_{7(-25)}. Secondly, G^\Gamma is noncompact. Thirdly, there exists an element \sigma\in\Gamma corresponding to a symmetric pair of anti-holomorphic type such that \pi_K is discretely decomposable as a (\mathfrak{g}^\sigma,K^\sigma)-module.
