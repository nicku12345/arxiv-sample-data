Let G be a finite group. The ring R_\mathbb{K}(G) of virtual characters of G over the field \mathbb{K} is a \lambda-ring; as such, it is equipped with the so-called \Gamma-filtration, first defined by Grothendieck. We explore the properties of the associated graded ring R^*_\mathbb{K}(G), and present a set of tools to compute it through detailed examples. In particular, we use the functoriality of R^*_\mathbb{K}(-), and the topological properties of the \Gamma-filtration, to explicitly determine the graded character ring over the complex numbers of every group of order at most 8, as well as that of dihedral groups of order 2p for p prime.
