Recently, a strong exponential character bound has been established in [3] for all elements g \in \mathbf{G}^F of a finite reductive group \mathbf{G}^F which satisfy the condition that the centraliser C_{\mathbf{G}}(g) is contained in a (\mathbf{G},F)-split Levi subgroup \mathbf{M} of \mathbf{G} and that \mathbf{G} is defined over a field of good characteristic. In this paper, assuming a weak version of Lusztig's conjecture relating irreducible characters and characteristic functions of character sheaves holds, we considerably generalize this result by removing the condition that \mathbf{M} is split. This assumption is known to hold whenever Z(\mathbf{G}) is connected or when \mathbf{G} is a special linear or symplectic group and \mathbf{G} is defined over a sufficiently large finite field.
