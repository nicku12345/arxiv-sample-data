The symmetric algebra S(\mathfrak g) of a reductive Lie algebra \mathfrak g is equipped with the standard Poisson structure, i.e., the Lie-Poisson bracket. Poisson-commutative subalgebras of S(\mathfrak g) attract a great deal of attention, because of their relationship to integrable systems and, more recently, to geometric representation theory. The transcendence degree of a Poisson-commutative subalgebra {\mathcal C}\subset S(\mathfrak g) is bounded by the "magic number" \boldsymbol{b}(\mathfrak g) of \mathfrak g. The "argument shift method" of Mishchenko-Fomenko was basically the only known source of \mathcal C with {\rm trdeg\,}{\mathcal C}=\boldsymbol{b}(\mathfrak g). We introduce an essentially different construction related to symmetric decompositions \mathfrak g=\mathfrak g_0\oplus\mathfrak g_1. Poisson-commutative subalgebras \mathcal Z,\tilde{\mathcal Z}\subset S(\mathfrak g)^{\mathfrak g_0} of the maximal possible transcendence degree are presented. If the \mathbb Z_2-contraction \mathfrak g_0\ltimes\mathfrak g_1^{\sf ab} has a polynomial ring of symmetric invariants, then \tilde{\mathcal Z} is a polynomial maximal Poisson-commutative subalgebra of S(\mathfrak g)^{\mathfrak g_0}, and its free generators are explicitly described.
