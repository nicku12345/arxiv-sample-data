Let W be an Iwahori Weyl group and W(1) be an extension of W by an abelian group. Vigneras gave a description of the R-algebra \mathcal{H}_R(q_{\tilde{s}}, c_{\tilde{s}}) associated to W(1), and also gave a basis of the center of \mathcal{H}_R(q_{\tilde{s}}, c_{\tilde{s}}) using the Bernstein presentation of \mathcal{H}_R(q_{\tilde{s}}, c_{\tilde{s}}). In this paper, we restrict to the case where q_{\tilde{s}}=0 and use the Iwahori-Matsumoto presentation to give a basis of the center of \mathcal{H}_R(0, c_{\tilde{s}}).
