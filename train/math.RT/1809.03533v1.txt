We present a closed formula, analogous to the Weyl dimension formula, for the signature of an invariant Hermitian form on any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of a real reductive Lie group, assuming that such a form exists. The formula shows in a precise sense that the form must be very indefinite. For example, if an irreducible representation of GL(n,R) admits an invariant form of signature (p,q), then we show that (p-q)^2 \le p+q. The proof is an application of Kostant's computation of the kernel of the Dirac operator.
