Up to equivalence, this paper classifies all the irreducible unitary representations with non-zero Dirac cohomology for the following simple real exceptional Lie groups: {\rm EI}=E_{6(6)}, {\rm EIV}=E_{6(-26)}, {\rm FI}=F_{4(4)}, {\rm FII}=F_{4(-20)}. Along the way, we find an irreducible unitary representation of F_{4(4)} whose Dirac index vanishes, while its Dirac cohomology is non-zero. This disproves a conjecture raised in 2015 asserting that there should be no cancellation between the even part and the odd part of the Dirac cohomology.
