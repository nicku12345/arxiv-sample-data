We find a relationship between the global dimension of an algebra A and the global dimension of the endomorphism algebra of a \tau-tilting module, when A is of finite global dimension. We show that, in general, the global dimension of the endomorphism algebra is not always finite. For monomial algebras and special biserial algebras of global dimension two, we prove that the global dimension of the endomorphism algebra of any \tau-tilting module is always finite. Moreover, for special biserial algebras, we give an explicit bound.
