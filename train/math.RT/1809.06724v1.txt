In this article, we describe all two sided ideals of a cyclotomic rational Cherednik algebra H_\mathbf{c} and its spherical subalgebra eH_\mathbf{c} e with a Weil generic aspherical parameter \mathbf{c}, and further describe the simple modules in the category \mathcal{O}^{sph}_\mathbf{c} . The main tools we use are categorical Kac-Moody actions on catogories \mathcal{O}_\mathbf{c} and restriction functors for Harish-Chandra bimodules.
