We define an action of the degenerate two boundary braid algebra \mathcal{G}_d on the \mathbb{C}-vector space M\otimes N\otimes V^{\otimes d}, where M and N are arbitrary modules for the general linear Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{gl}(n|m), and V is the natural representation. When M and N are parametrized by rectangular hook Young diagrams, this action factors through a quotient \mathcal{H}^{\operatorname{ext}}_d. The irreducible summands of M\otimes N\otimes V^{\otimes d} for the centralizer of \mathfrak{gl}(n|m), remain irreducible once regarded as modules for this quotient \mathcal{H}^{\operatorname{ext}}_d.
