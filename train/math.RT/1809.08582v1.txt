We give explicit formulas proving restrictedness of the following Lie (super)algebras: known exceptional simple vectorial Lie (super)algebras in characteristic 3, deformed Lie (super)algebras with indecomposable Cartan matrix, and (under certain conditions) their simple subquotients over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 3, as well as one type of the deformed divergence-free Lie superalgebras with any number of indeterminates in any characteristic.
