Let \mathfrak{o} be the ring of integers of a non-archimedean local field with the maximal ideal \wp and the finite residue field of characteristic p. Let \mathbf{G} be the General Linear or Special Linear group with entries from the finite quotients \mathfrak{o}/\wp^\ell of \mathfrak{o} and \mathbf{U} be the subgroup of \mathbf{G} consisting of upper triangular unipotent matrices. We prove that the induced representation \mathrm{Ind}^{\mathbf{G}}_{\mathbf{U}}(\theta) of \mathbf{G} obtained from a {\it non-degenerate} character \theta of \mathbf{U} is multiplicity free for all \ell \geq 2. This is analogous to the multiplicity one theorem regarding Gelfand-Graev representation for the finite Chevalley groups. We prove that for many cases the regular representations of \mathbf{G} are characterized by the property that these are the constituents of the induced representation \mathrm{Ind}^{\mathbf{G}}_{\mathbf{U}}(\theta) for some non-degenerate character \theta of \mathbf{U}. We use this to prove that the restriction of a regular representation of General Linear groups over \mathfrak{O}/\wp^\ell to the Special Linear groups is multiplicity free for all \ell \geq 2 and also obtain the corresponding branching rules in many cases.
