Let (\mathcal{K},\mathcal{O},k) be a p-modular system with k algebraically closed, let b be a block of the normal subgroup H of G having defect pointed group Q_\delta in H and P_\gamma in G, and consider the block extension b\mathcal{O}G. One may attach to b an extended local category \mathcal{E}_{(b,H,G)}, a group extension L of Z(Q) by N_G(Q_\delta)/C_H(Q) having P as a Sylow p-subgroup, and a cohomology class [\alpha]\in H^2(N_G(Q_\delta)/QC_H(Q),k^\times). We prove that these objects are invariant under the G/H-graded basic Morita equivalences. Along the way, we give alternative proofs of the results of K\"ulshammer and Puig (1990), Puig and Zhou (2012) on extensions of nilpotent blocks. We also deduce by our methods a result of Zhou (2016) on p'-extensions of inertial blocks.
