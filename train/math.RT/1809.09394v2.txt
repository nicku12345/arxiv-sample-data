We construct a new analogue of the BGG category \mathcal O for the infinite-dimensional Lie algebras \fg=\mathfrak{sl}(\infty),\mathfrak{o}(\infty), \mathfrak{sp}(\infty). A main difference with the categories studied in \cite{Nam} and \cite{CP} is that all objects of our category satisfy the large annihilator condition introduced in \cite{DPS}. Despite the fact that the splitting Borel subalgebras \fb of \fg are not conjugate, one can eliminate the dependency on the choice of \fb and introduce a universal highest weight category \mathcal {OLA} of \fg-modules, the letters \mathcal{LA} coming from "large annihilator". The subcategory of integrable objects in \mathcal {OLA} is precisely the category \mathbb T_{\fg} studied in \cite{DPS}. We investigate the structure of \mathcal {OLA}, and in particular compute the multiplicities of simple objects in standard objects and the multiplicities of standard objects in indecomposable injectives.
