The blob algebra is a finite-dimensional quotient of the Hecke algebra of type B which is almost always quasi-hereditary. We construct the indecomposable tilting modules for the blob algebra over a field of characteristic 0 in the doubly critical case. Every indecomposable tilting module of maximal highest weight is either a projective module or an extension of a simple module by a projective module. Moreover, every indecomposable tilting module is a submodule of an indecomposable tilting module of maximal highest weight. We conclude that the graded Weyl multiplicities of the indecomposable tilting modules in this case are given by inverse Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of type \tilde{A}_1.
