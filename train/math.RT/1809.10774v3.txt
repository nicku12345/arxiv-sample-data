In arXiv:1807.09038 we formulated a conjecture describing the derived category D-mod(Gr_{GL(n)}) of (all) D-modules on the affine Grassmannian of the group GL(n) as the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a certain stack (it is explained in loc. cit. that this conjecture "follows" naturally from some heuristic arguments involving 3-dimensional quantum field theory). In this paper we prove a weaker version of this conjecture for the case n=2.
