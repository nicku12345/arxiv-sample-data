Let {\bf G} be a split classical group over a non-Archimedean local field F with the cardinality of the residue field q_F>5. Let M be the group of F-points of a Levi factor of a proper F-parabolic subgroup of {\bf G}. Let [M, \sigma_M]_M be an inertial class such that \sigma_M contains a depth-zero Moy--Prasad type of the form (K_M, \tau_M), where K_M is a hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup of M. Let K be a hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup of {\bf G}(F) such that K contains K_M. In this article, we classify \mathfrak{s}-typical representations of K. In particular, we show that the \mathfrak{s}-typical representations of K are precisely the irreducible subrepresentations of \ind_J^K\lambda, where (J, \lambda) is a level-zero G-cover of (K\cap M, \tau_M).
