Let H be the Iwahori-Hecke algebra and let J be Lusztig's asymptotic Hecke algebra, both specialized to type \tilde{A}_1. For \mathrm{SL}_2, when the parameter q is specialized to a prime power, Braverman and Kazhdan showed recently that a completion of H has codimension two as a subalgebra of a completion of J, and described a basis for the quotient in spectral terms. In this note we write these functions explicitly in terms of the basis \{t_w\} of J, and further invert the canonical isomorphism between the completions of H and J, obtaining explicit formulas for the each basis element t_w in terms of the basis \{T_w\} of H. We conjecture some properties of this expansion for more general groups. We conclude by using our formulas to prove that J acts on the Schwartz space of the basic affine space of \mathrm{SL}_2, and produce some formulas for this action.
