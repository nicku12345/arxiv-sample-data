For p a prime number and \mathscr{P} a p-equipped finite partially ordered set we construct two different right-peak algebras (in the sense of \cite{KS}) \Lambda^{(r)} and \Lambda^{(c)}. We consider the category \mathcal{U}^{(r)} \left(\mathcal{U}^{(c)}\right) consisting of the finitely generated right \Lambda^{(r)}-modules (\Lambda^{(c)}-modules) which are socle-projective. The categories \mathcal{U}^{(r)} and \mathcal{U}^{(c)} have almost split sequences. We describe he Auslander-Reiten components \mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{U}}^{(r)} and \mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{U}}^{(c)} of the corresponding simple projective modules in \mathcal{U}^{(r)} and \mathcal{U}^{(c)}. Then we prove that there is a bijective correspondence between \mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{U}}^{(r)} and \mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{U}}^{(c)}, although the corresponding almost split sequences have different shapes.
