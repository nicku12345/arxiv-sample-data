We define and study a new class of bialgebras, which generalize certain Turner double algebras related to generic blocks of symmetric groups. Bases and generators of these algebras are given. We investigate when the algebras are symmetric, which is relevant to block theory of finite groups. We then establish a double centralizer property related to blocks of Schur algebras.
