We define and study new classes of quasi-hereditary and cellular algebras which generalize Turner's double algebras. Turner's algebras provide a local description of blocks of symmetric groups up to derived equivalence. Our general construction allows one to `schurify' any quasi-hereditary algebra A to obtain a generalized Schur algebra S^A(n,d) which we prove is again quasi-hereditary if d\leq n. We describe decomposition numbers of S^A(n,d) in terms of those of A and the classical Schur algebra S(n,d). In fact, it is essential to work with quasi-hereditary superalgebras A, in which case the construction of the schurification involves a non-trivial full rank sub-lattice T^A_\mathfrak{a}(n,d)\subseteq S^A(n,d).
