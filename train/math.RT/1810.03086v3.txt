A double extension (\mathscr{D} extension) of a Lie (super)algebra \mathfrak a with a non-degenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form \mathscr{B}, briefly: a NIS-(super)algebra, is an enlargement of \mathfrak a by means of a central extension and a derivation; the affine Kac-Moody algebras are the best known examples of double extensions of loops algebras.   Let \mathfrak a be a restricted Lie (super)algebra with a NIS \mathscr{B}. Suppose \mathfrak a has a restricted derivation \mathscr{D} such that \mathscr{B} is \mathscr{D}-invariant. We show that the double extension of \mathfrak a constructed by means of \mathscr{B} and \mathscr{D} is restricted. We show that, the other way round, any restricted NIS-(super)algebra with non-trivial center can be obtained as a \mathscr{D}-extension of another restricted NIS-(super)algebra subject to an extra condition on the central element.   We give new examples of \mathscr{D}-extensions of restricted Lie (super)algebras, and pre-Lie superalgebras indigenous to characteristic 3.
