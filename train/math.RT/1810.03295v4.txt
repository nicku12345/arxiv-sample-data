For a reductive group G, we study the Drinfeld-Gaitsgory functor of the category of conjugation-equivariant D-modules on G. We show that this functor is an equivalence of categories, and that it has a filtration with layers expressed via parabolic induction of parabolic restriction. We use this to provide a conceptual definition of the Deligne-Lusztig involution on the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible character D-modules, which was defined previously in [Lu1, section 15].
