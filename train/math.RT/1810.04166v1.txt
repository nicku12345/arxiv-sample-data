Let G be a finite solvable group. Then G always has a useful presentation, which we call a "long presentation". Using a "long presentation" of G, we present an inductive method of constructing the irreducible representations of G over \mathbb{C} and computing the primitive central idempotents of the complex group algebra \mathbb{C}[G]. For a finite abelian group, we present a systematic method of constructing the irreducible representations over a field of characteristic either 0 or prime to order of the group and also a systematic method of computing the primitive central idempotents of the semisimple abelian group algebra.
