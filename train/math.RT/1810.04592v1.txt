We classify all irreducible generic \mathrm{VI}-modules in non-describing characteristic. Our result degenerates to yield a classification of irreducible generic \mathrm{FI}-modules in arbitrary characteristic. Our result can also be viewed as a classification theorem for a natural class of representations of \mathbf{GL}_{\infty}(\mathbf{F}_q).
