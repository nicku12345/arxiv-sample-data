Let G be a finite group, H be a normal subgroup of prime index p. Let F be a field of either characteristic 0 or prime to |G|. Let \eta be an irreducible F-representation of H. If F is an algebraically closed field of characteristic either 0 or prime to |G|, then the induced representation \eta \uparrow^{G}_{H} is either irreducible or a direct sum of p pairwise inequivalent irreducible representations. In this paper, we show that if F is not assumed algebraically closed field, then there are five possibilities in the decomposition of induced representation into irreducible representations.
