Let G_{\mathbb R} be the set of real points of a complex linear reductive group and \hat G_\lambda its classes of irreducible admissible representations with infinitesimal integral regular character \lambda. In this case each cell of representations is associated to a \emph{special} nilpotent orbit. This helps organize the corresponding set of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules. The goal of this paper is to is to describe algorithms for identifying the special nilpotent orbit attached to a cell in terms of descent sets appearing in the cell.
