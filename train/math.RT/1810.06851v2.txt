We study three fundamental topics in the representation theory of disconnected algebraic groups whose identity component is reductive: (i) the classification of irreducible representations; (ii) the existence and properties of Weyl and dual Weyl modules; and (iii) the decomposition map relating representations in characteristic 0 and those in characteristic p (for groups defined over discrete valuation rings). For each of these topics, we obtain natural generalizations of the well-known results for connected reductive groups.
