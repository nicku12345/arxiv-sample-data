Let G/H be a reductive symmetric space over a p-adic field F, the algebraic groups G and H being assumed semisimple of relative rank 1. One of the branching problems for the Steinberg representation \St_G of G is the determination of the dimension of the intertwining space {\rm Hom}_H (\St_G ,\pi ), for any irreducible representation \pi of H. In this work we do not compute this dimension, but show how it is related to the dimensions of some other intertwining spaces {\rm Hom}_{K_i} ({\tilde \pi} ,1), for a certain finite family K_i, i=1,...,r, of anisotropic subgroups of H (here {\tilde \pi} denote the contragredient representation, and 1 the trivial character). In other words we show that there is a sort of `reciprocity law' relating two different branching problems.
