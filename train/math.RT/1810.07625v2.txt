In this paper we classify the irreducible Harish-Chandra bimodules with full support over filtered quantizations of conical symplectic singularities under the condition that none of the slices to codimension 2 symplectic leaves has type E_8. More precisely, we show that the top quotient \overline{\operatorname{HC}}(\mathcal{A}_\lambda) of the category of Harish-Chandra bimodules over the quantization \mathcal{A}_\lambda with parameter \lambda embeds into the category of representations of the algebraic fundamental group, \Gamma, of the open leaf. The image coincides with the representations of \Gamma/\Gamma_\lambda, where \Gamma_\lambda is a normal subgroup of \Gamma that can be recovered from the quantization parameter \lambda. As an application of our results, we describe the Lusztig quotient group in terms of the geometry of the normalization of the orbit closure in almost all cases.
