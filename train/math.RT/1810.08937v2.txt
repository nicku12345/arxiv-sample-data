Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over a finite field with q elements. In the 1980's, Kawanaka introduced generalised Gelfand-Graev representations of the finite group G(F_q), assuming that q is a power of a good prime for G. These representations have turned out to be extremely useful in various contexts. Here we investigate to what extent Kawanaka's construction can be carried out when we drop the assumptions on~q. As a curious by-product, we obtain a new, conjectural characterisation of Lusztig's concept of special unipotent classes of G in terms of weighted Dynkin diagrams.
