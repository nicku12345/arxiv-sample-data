Let \mathbb{N} be a set of the natural numbers.   Symmetric inverse semigroup R_\infty is the semigroup of all infinite 0-1 matrices \left[ g_{ij}\right]_{i,j\in \mathbb{N}} with at most one 1 in each row and each column such that g_{ii}=1 on the complement of a finite set. The binary operation in R_\infty is the ordinary matrix multiplication. It is clear that infinite symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_\infty is a subgroup of R_\infty. The map \star:\left[ g_{ij}\right]\mapsto\left[ g_{ji}\right] is an involution on R_\infty. We call a function f on R_\infty positive definite if for all r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n\in R_\infty the matrix \left[ f\left( r_ir_j^\star\right)\right] is Hermitian and non-negatively definite. A function f said to be indecomposable if the corresponding \star-representation \pi_f is a factor-representation. A class of the R_\infty-central functions (characters) is defined by the condition f(rs)=f(sr) for all r,s\in R_\infty. In this paper we classify all factor-representations of R_\infty that correspond to the R_\infty-central positive definite functions.
