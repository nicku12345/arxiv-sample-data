For local non-archimedean fields k, Piatetski-Shapiro has defined local spinor L-factors for irreducible representations \Pi of \mathrm{GSp}(4,k) of dimension >1, attached to a choice of a Bessel model \Lambda. We classify regular poles that do not come from the asymptotic of the Bessel functions in the Bessel model. For anisotropic Bessel models there are no such subregular poles.
