Let \mathfrak{g} be a simple Lie algebra over \mathbb{C} and G be the corresponding simply connected algebraic group. Consider a nilpotent element e\in \mathfrak{g}, the corresponding element \chi=(e, \bullet) in \mathfrak{g}^*, and the coadjoint orbit \mathbb{O}=G\chi. We are interested in the set \mathfrak{J}\mathfrak{d}^1(\mathcal{W}) of codimension 1 ideals J\subset \mathcal{W} in a finite W-algebra \mathcal{W}=U(\mathfrak{g}, e). We have a natural action of the component group \Gamma=Z_G(\chi)/Z_G^\circ(\chi) on \mathfrak{J}\mathfrak{d}^1(\mathcal{W}). Denote the set of \Gamma-stable points of \mathfrak{J}\mathfrak{d}^1(\mathcal{W}) by \mathfrak{J}\mathfrak{d}^{1}(\mathcal{W})^{\Gamma}. For a classical \mathfrak{g} Premet and Topley proved that \mathfrak{J}\mathfrak{d}^{1}(\mathcal{W})^{\Gamma} is isomorphic to an affine space. In this paper we will give an easier and shorter proof of this fact.
