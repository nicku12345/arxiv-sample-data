For a finite dimensional algebra A with 0 < \phi dim (A) = m < \infty we prove that there always exist modules M and N such that \phi(M) = m-1 and \phi (N) = 1. On the other hand, we see an example of an algebra that not every value between 1 and its \phi-dimension is reached by the \phi function. We call that values gaps and we prove that the algebras with gaps verifies the finitistic conjecture.
