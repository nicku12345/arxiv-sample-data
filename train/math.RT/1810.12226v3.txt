In this paper we define and study a critical-level generalization of the Suzuki functor, relating the affine general linear Lie algebra to the rational Cherednik algebra of type A. Our main result states that this functor induces a surjective algebra homomorphism from the centre of the completed universal enveloping algebra at the critical level to the centre of the rational Cherednik algebra at t=0. We use this homomorphism to obtain several results about the functor. We compute it on Verma modules, Weyl modules, and their restricted versions. We describe the maps between endomorphism rings induced by the functor and deduce that every simple module over the rational Cherednik algebra lies in its image. Our homomorphism between the two centres gives rise to a closed embedding of the Calogero-Moser space into the space of opers on the punctured disc. We give a partial geometric description of this embedding.
