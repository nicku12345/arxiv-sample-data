Let G and \tilde G be reductive groups over a local field F. Let \eta : \tilde G \to G be a F-homomorphism with commutative kernel and commutative cokernel. We investigate the pullbacks of irreducible admissible G-representations \pi along \eta. Following Borel, Adler--Korman and Xu, we pose a conjecture on the decomposition of the pullback \eta^* \pi. It is formulated in terms of enhanced Langlands parameters and includes multiplicities. This can be regarded as a functoriality property of the local Langlands correspondence. We prove this conjecture for three classes: principal series representation of split groups (over non-archimedean local fields), unipotent representations (also with F non-archimedean) and inner twists of GL_n, SL_n, PGL_n. Our main techniques involve Hecke algebras associated to Langlands parameters. We also prove a version of the pullback/functoriality conjecture for those.
