In this paper, we show that, under certain assumptions, a parabolic induction Ind_B^G\lambda from the Borel subgroup B of a (real or p-adic) reductive group G decomposes into a direct sum of the form: \[ Ind_B^G\lambda = \left(Ind_P^G St_M\otimes \chi_0\right) \oplus \left(Ind_P^G \mathbf{1}_M\otimes \chi_0\right), \] where P is a parabolic subgroup of G with Levi subgroup M of semi-simple rank 1, \mathbf{1}_M is the trivial representation of M, St_M is the Steinberg representation of M and \chi_0 is a certain character of M. We construct examples of this phenomenon for all simply-connected simple groups of rank at least 2.
