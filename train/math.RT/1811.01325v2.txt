Let V be the two-dimensional simple module and M be a projective Verma module for the quantum group of \mathfrak{sl}_2 at generic q. We show that for any r\ge 1, the endomorphism algebra of M\otimes V^{\otimes r} is isomorphic to the type B Temperley-Lieb algebra \rm{TLB}_r(q, Q) for an appropriate parameter Q depending on M. The parameter Q is determined explicitly. We also use the cellular structure to determine precisely for which values of r the endomorphism algebra is semisimple. A key element of our method is to identify the algebras \rm{TLB}_r(q,Q) as the endomorphism algebras of the objects in a quotient category of the category of coloured ribbon graphs of Freyd-Yetter or the tangle diagrams of Turaev and Reshitikhin.
