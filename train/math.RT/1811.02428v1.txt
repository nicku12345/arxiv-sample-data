Buan, Iyama, Reiten and Smith proved that the superpotential of a quiver corresponding to an element of Coxeter group is rigid. In this paper, we extend this result to the Berenstein-Fomin-Zelevinsky quivers corresponding to double Bruhat cells of symmetric Kac-Moody algebras. We also realize these quivers as dimers models on cylinder over corresponding graphs.
