Applying Robert Boltje's theory of canonical induction, we give a restriction-preserving formula expressing any p-permutation module as a \mathbb{Z}[1/p]-linear combination of modules induced and inflated from projective modules associated with subquotient groups. The underlying constructions include, for any given finite group, a ring with a \mathbb{Z}-basis indexed by conjugacy classes of triples (U, K, E) where U is a subgroup, K is a p'-residue-free normal subgroup of U and E is an indecomposable projective module of the group algebra of U/K.
