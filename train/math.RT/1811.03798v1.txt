Given an ST-triple (\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D},M) one can associate a co-t-structure on \mathcal{C} and a t-structure on \mathcal{D}. It is shown that the discreteness of \mathcal{C} with respect to the co-t-structure is equivalent to the discreteness of \mathcal{D} with respect to the t-structure. As a special case, the discreteness of \mathcal{D}^b(\mathrm{mod} A) in the sense of Vossieck is equivalent to the discreteness of K^b(\mathrm{proj} A) in a dual sense, where A is a finite-dimensional algebra.
