We determine the occurrence and explicitly describe the theta lifts on all levels of all the irreducible generic representations for the dual pair of groups (\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}, \mathrm{O}(V)) defined over a local nonarchimedean field \mathbb{F} of characteristic 0. As a direct application of our results, we are able to produce a series of non-generic unitarizable representations of these groups.
