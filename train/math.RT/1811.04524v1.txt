We state a conjecture about the Weyl group action coming from Geometric Satake on zero-weight spaces in terms of equivariant multiplicities of Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen cycles. We prove it for small coweights in type A. In this case, using work of Braverman, Gaitsgory and Vybornov, we show that the Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen basis agrees with the Springer basis. We rephrase this in terms of equivariant multiplicities using work of Joseph and Hotta. We also have analogous results for Ginzburg's Lagrangian construction of \mathfrak{sl}_n representations.
