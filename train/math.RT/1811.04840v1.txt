We investigate support schemes for infinitesimal unipotent supergroups and their representations. Our main results provide a non-cohomological description of these schemes which generalizes the classical work of Suslin, Friedlander, and Bendel. As a consequence, support schemes in this setting have the desired features of such a theory, including naturality with respect to group homomorphisms, the tensor product property, and realizability. As an application of the theory developed here, we investigate support varieties for certain finite-dimensional Hopf subalgebras of the Steenrod algebra.
