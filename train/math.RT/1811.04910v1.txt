We study the irreducible quotient \mathcal{L}_{t,c} of the polynomial representation of the rational Cherednik algebra \mathcal{H}_{t,c}(S_n,\mathfrak{h}) of type A_{n-1} over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic p where p|n-1. In the t=0 case, for all c\ne 0 we give a complete description of the polynomials in the maximal proper graded submodule \ker \mathcal{B}, the kernel of the contravariant form \mathcal{B}, and subsequently find the Hilbert series of the irreducible quotient \mathcal{L}_{0,c}. In the t=1 case, we give a complete description of the polynomials in \ker \mathcal{B} when the characteristic p=2 and c is transcendental over \mathbb{F}_2, and compute the Hilbert series of the irreducible quotient \mathcal{L}_{1,c}. In doing so, we prove a conjecture due to Etingof and Rains completely for p=2, and also for any t=0 and n\equiv 1\pmod{p}. Furthermore, for t=1, we prove a simple criterion to determine whether a given polynomial f lies in \ker \mathcal{B} for all n=kp+r with r and p fixed.
