Let G be a finite group and \mathbb{K} a field of characteristic zero. the ring R_\mathbb{K}(G) of virtual characters of G over \mathbb{K} is naturally endowed with a so-called Grothendieck filtration, with associated graded ring R^*_\mathbb{K}(G). Restriction of representations to any H\leq G induces a homomorphism R^*_\mathbb{K}(G) \to R^*_\mathbb{K}(H). We show that, when G is abelian, induction of representations preserves the filtration, so R^*_\mathbb{C}(-) is a Mackey functor; in the general case, we propose a modified filtration which turns R^*_\mathbb{K}(-) into a Mackey functor. We then turn to tensor induction of representations, and show that in the abelian case R^*_\mathbb{C}(-) is a Tambara functor.
