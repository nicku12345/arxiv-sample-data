We compute special unipotent Arthur packets for real reductive groups in many cases. We list the cases that lead to incomplete answers, and in those cases, provide a suitable set of representations that could lead to a complete description of the special Arthur packet. In the process of achieving this goal we classify theta forms of a given even complex nilpotent orbit, and find methods to compute the associated varieties of irreducible group representations.
