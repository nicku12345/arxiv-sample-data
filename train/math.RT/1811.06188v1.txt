We initiate the study of Gaitsgory's central sheaves using complexes of Soergel bimodules, in extended affine type A. We conjecture that the complex associated to the standard representation can be flattened to a central complex in finite type A, which is the complex sought after in a conjecture of Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen.
