In this paper, we prove certain multiplicity one theorems and define twisted gamma factors for irreducible generic cuspidal representations of split G_2 over finite fields k of odd characteristic. Then we prove the first converse theorem for exceptional groups, namely, GL_1 and GL_2-twisted gamma factors will uniquely determine an irreducible generic cuspidal representation of G_2(k).
