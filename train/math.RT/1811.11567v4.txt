Let us suppose that \mathbb{Q}_p is the field of p-adic numbers and \mathbb{G} is a split connected reductive group scheme over \mathbb{Z}_p. In this work we will introduce a sheaf of twisted arithmetic differential operators on the formal flag variety of \mathbb{G}, associated to a general character. We will generalize the arguments of C. Huyghe and T. Schmidt, concerning the \mathcal{D}^{\dag}-affinity of the formal flag variety of \mathbb{G}, of certain sheaves of p-adically complete twisted arithmetic differential operators associated to an algebraic character, and the calculation of the global sections.
