This paper gives a general algorithm for computing the character table of any Renner monoid Hecke algebra, by adapting and generalizing techniques of Solomon used to study the rook monoid. The character table of the Hecke algebra of the rook monoid (i.e., the Cartan type A Renner monoid) was computed earlier by Dieng, Halverson, and Poladian using different methods. Our approach uses analogues of so-called A- and B-matrices of Solomon. In addition to the algorithm, we give explicit combinatorial formulas for the A- and B-matrices in Cartan type C and use them to obtain an explicit description of the character table for the type C Renner monoid Hecke algebra.
