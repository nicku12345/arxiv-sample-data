For a complex reductive Lie group G Tits defined an extension W_G^T of the corresponding Weyl group W_G. The extended group is supplied with an embedding into the normalizer N_G(H) of the maximal torus H\subset G such that W_G^T together with H generate N_G(H). We give an interpretation of the Tits classical construction in terms of the maximal split real form G(\mathbb{R})\subset G(\mathbb{C}), leading to a simple topological description of W^T_G. We also propose a different extension W_G^U of the Weyl group W_G associated with the compact real form U\subset G(\mathbb{C}). This results into a presentation of the normalizer of maximal torus of the group extension U\ltimes {\rm Gal}(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}) by the Galois group {\rm Gal}(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}). We also describe explicitly the adjoint action of W_G^T and W^U_G on the Lie algebra of G.
