We prove quantum dilogarithm identities for n-cycle quivers. By the combinatorial approach of Keller, each side of our identity determines a maximal green sequence of quiver mutations. Thus we interpret our identities as factorizations of the refined Donaldson--Thomas invariant for the quiver with potential. Finally, we conjecture an upper bound on the possible lengths of maximal green sequences.
