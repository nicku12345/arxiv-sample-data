The most famous simple Lie algebra is sl_n (the n \times n matrices with trace equals 0). The representation theory for sl_n has been one of the most important research areas for the past hundred years and within their the simple finite-dimensional modules have become very important. They are classified and Gelfand and Tsetlin actually gave an explicit construction of a basis for every simple module. We extend it by providing theorems and proofs, and construct monomial bases of the simple module.
