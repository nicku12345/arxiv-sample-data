We present a full list of all representations of the special linear group \mathrm{SL}_n over the complex numbers with complete intersection invariant ring, completing the classification of Shmelkin. For this task, we combine three techniques. Firstly, the graph method for invariants of \mathrm{SL}_n developed by the author to compute invariants, covariants and explicit forms of syzygies. Secondly, a new algorithm for finding a monomial order such that a certain basis of an ideal is a Gr\"obner basis with respect to this order, inbetween usual Gr\"obner basis computation and computation of the Gr\"obner fan. Lastly, a modification of an algorithm by Xin for MacMahon partition analysis to compute Hilbert series.
