We develop a general framework for studying relative weight representations for certain pairs consisting of an associative algebra and a commutative subalgebra. Using these tools we describe projective and simple weight modules for quantum Weyl algebras for generic values of deformation parameters. We consider two quantum versions: one by Maltsiniotis and the other one by Akhavizadegan and Jordan.
