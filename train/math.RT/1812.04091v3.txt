Let F be a p-adic field of characteristic zero and odd residual characteristic. Let \mathbf{Sp}_{2n}(F) denote the symplectic group defined over F, where n\geq 2. We prove that the Speh representations \mathcal{U}(\delta,2), where \delta is a discrete series representation of \mathbf{GL}_n(F), lie in the discrete spectrum of the p-adic symmetric space \mathbf{Sp}_{2n}(F) \backslash \mathbf{GL}_{2n}(F).
