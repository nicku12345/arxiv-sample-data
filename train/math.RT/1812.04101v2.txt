Let F be a nonarchimedean local field with odd residual characteristic and let G be the F-points of a connected reductive group defined over F. Let \theta be an F-involution of G. Let H be the subgroup of \theta-fixed points in G. Let \chi be a quasi-character of H. A smooth complex representation (\pi,V) of G is (H,\chi)-distinguished if there exists a nonzero element \lambda in \operatorname{Hom}_H(\pi,\chi). We generalize a construction of descended invariant linear forms on Jacquet modules first carried out independently by Kato and Takano (2008), and Lagier (2008) to the setting of (H,\chi)-distinction. We follow the methods of Kato and Takano, providing a new proof of similar results of Delorme (2010). Moreover, we give an (H,\chi)-analogue of Kato and Takano's relative version of the Jacquet Subrepresentation Theorem. In the case that \chi is unramified, \pi is parabolically induced from a \theta-stable parabolic subgroup of G, and \lambda arises via the closed orbit in Q\backslash G / H, we study the (non)vanishing of the descended forms via the support of \lambda-relative matrix coefficients.
