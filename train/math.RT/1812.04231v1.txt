Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system and \ast an automorphism of W with order \leq 2 and S^{\ast}=S. Lusztig and Vogan ([11], [14]) have introduced a u-deformed version M_u of Kottwitz's involution module over the Iwahori-Hecke algebra \mathscr{H}_{u}(W) with Hecke parameter u^2, where u is an indeterminate. Lusztig has proved that M_u is isomorphic to the left \mathscr{H}_{u}(W)-submodule of {\hat{\mathscr{H}}}_u generated by X_{\emptyset}:=\sum_{w^*=w\in W}{u^{-\ell(w)}T_w}, where {\hat{\mathscr{H}}}_u is the vector space consisting of all formal (possibly infinite) sums \sum_{x\in W}{c_xT_x} (c_x\in\mathbb{Q}(u) for each x). He speculated that one can extend this by replacing u with any \lambda\in \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1,-1\}. In this paper, we give a positive answer to his speculation for any \lambda\in K\setminus\{0,1,-1\} and any W, where K is an arbitrary ground field.
