We classify generalized tilting modules and full exceptional sequences for the family of quasi-hereditary quotients of type A zig-zag algebras and for a related family of algebras. We also give a characterization of these quotients as quasi-hereditary algebras with simple preserving duality that are 'close' to self-injective algebras.
