Let \mathscr T be a 2-Calabi--Yau triangulated category, T a cluster tilting object with endomorphism algebra \Gamma. Consider the functor \mathscr T( T,- ) : \mathscr T \rightarrow \mod \Gamma. It induces a bijection from the isomorphism classes of cluster tilting objects to the isomorphism classes of support \tau-tilting pairs. This is due to Adachi, Iyama, and Reiten.   The notion of ( d+2 )-angulated categories is a higher analogue of triangulated categories. We show a higher analogue of the above result, based on the notion of maximal \tau_d-rigid pairs.
