In persistent homology of filtrations, the indecomposable decompositions provide the persistence diagrams. In multidimensional persistence it is known to be impossible to classify all indecomposable modules. One direction is to consider the subclass of interval-decomposable persistence modules, which are direct sums of interval representations. We introduce the definition of pre-interval representations, a more algebraic definition, and study the relationships between pre-interval, interval, and indecomposable thin representations. We show that over the `equioriented' commutative 2D grid, these concepts are equivalent. Moreover, we provide an algorithm for determining whether or not an nD persistence module is interval/pre-interval/thin-decomposable, under certain finiteness conditions and without explicitly computing decompositions.
