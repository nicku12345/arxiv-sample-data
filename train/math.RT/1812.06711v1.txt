Let G be a simple and simply connected algebraic group over an algebraically closed field \Bbbk of characteristic p>0. We establish an isomorphism of G-modules between a direct sum of modules \text{St} \otimes \text{St} and a direct sum of tensor products of simple modules of restricted highest weight with tilting modules that are projective over the Frobenius kernel of G. This isomorphism holds precisely when Donkin's Tilting Module Conjecture does, and thus can be seen as providing a G-module theoretic characterization of this conjecture.
