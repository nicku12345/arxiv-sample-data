We construct a resolution of irreducible complex representations of the symmetric group S_n by restrictions of representations of GL_n(\mathbb{C}) (where S_n is the subgroup of permutation matrices). This categorifies a recent result of Assaf and Speyer. Our construction also gives minimal resolutions of simple \mathcal{F}-modules (here \mathcal{F} is the category of finite sets).
