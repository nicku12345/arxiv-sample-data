The paper presented here focuses on the classification of trivial source Specht modules. We completely classify the trivial source Specht modules labelled by hook partitions. We also classify the trivial source Specht modules labelled by two-part partitions in the odd characteristic case. Moreover, in the even characteristic case, we prove a result for the classification of the trivial source Specht modules labelled by partitions with 2-weight 2, which justifies a conjecture of [16].
