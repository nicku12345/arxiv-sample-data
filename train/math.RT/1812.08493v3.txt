Let k be a field and \mathcal{C} a k-linear, Hom-finite triangulated category with split idempotents. In this paper, we show that under suitable circumstances, the Grothendieck group of \mathcal{C}, denoted K_0(\mathcal{C}), can be expressed as a quotient of the split Grothendieck group of a higher-cluster tilting subcategory of \mathcal{C}.   Assume that n\geq 2 is an even integer, \mathcal{C} is n-Calabi Yau and has an n-cluster tilting subcategory \mathcal{T}. Then, for every indecomposable M in \mathcal{T}, there is an Auslander-Reiten (n+2)-angle in \mathcal{T} of the form M\rightarrow T_{n-1}\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow T_0\rightarrow M and \begin{align*}   K_0(\mathcal{C})\cong K_0^{sp}(\mathcal{T})\big/\big \langle \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(-1)^i[T_i]\mid M\in\mathcal{T} \text{ indecomposable } \big\rangle. \end{align*} Assume now that d is a positive integer and \mathcal{C} has a d-cluster tilting subcategory \mathcal{S} closed under d-suspension. Then \mathcal{S} is a so called (d+2)-angulated category whose Grothendieck group K_0(\mathcal{S}) can be defined as a certain quotient of K_0^{sp}(\mathcal{S}). We will show   \begin{align*}   K_0(\mathcal{C})\cong K_0(\mathcal{S}).   \end{align*} Moreover, assume that n=2d, that all the above assumptions hold, and that \mathcal{T}\subseteq \mathcal{S}. Then our results can be combined to express K_0(\mathcal{S}) as a quotient of K_0^{sp}(\mathcal{T}).
