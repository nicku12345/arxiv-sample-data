We examine the crystal graph of the \widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_e-module arising from an \widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_e-categorification to study the defining endo-functors of the categorification. This yields lower bounds on the number of irreducible constituents of certain objects. We use Ariki's categorification result on Ariki-Koike algebras to obtain a new lower bound on the number of constituents of their parabolically induced modules. In particular this will imply reducibility of every induced module.
