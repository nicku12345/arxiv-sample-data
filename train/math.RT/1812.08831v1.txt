We determine the structure of the fibered biset functor sending a finite group G to the complex vector space of complex valued class functions of G. Previously, it is studied as a biset functor by Bouc and as a \mathbb C^\times-fibered biset functor by Boltje and the second author. In this paper, we complete the study by considering the other choices of the fiber group. As a corollary, we obtain a (previously known) set of composition factors of the biset functor of p-permutation modules.
