Let (G,\tau) be a finite-dimensional Lie group with an involutive automorphism \tau of G and let \mathfrak g = \mathfrak h \oplus \mathfrak q  be its corresponding Lie algebra decomposition. We show that every non-degenerate strongly continuous representation on a complex Hilbert space \mathcal H of an open *-subsemigroup S \subset G, where s^* = \tau(s)^{-1}, has an analytic extension to a strongly continuous unitary representation of the 1-connected Lie group G_1^c with Lie algebra [\mathfrak q,\mathfrak q] \oplus i\mathfrak q.   We further examine the minimal conditions under which an analytic extension to the 1-connected Lie group G^c with Lie algebra \mathfrak h \oplus i\mathfrak q exists. This result generalizes the L\"uscher-Mack Theorem and the extensions of the L\"uscher-Mack Theorem for *-subsemigroups satisfying S = S(G^\tau)_0 by Merigon, Neeb, and \'Olafsson.   Finally, we prove that non-degenerate strongly continuous representations of certain *-subsemigroups S can even be extended to representations of a generalized version of an Olshanski semigroup.
