We classify all simple bounded highest weight modules of a basic classical Lie superalgebra \mathfrak g. In particular, our classification leads to the classification of the simple weight modules with finite weight multiplicities over all classical Lie superalgebras. We also obtain some character formulas of strongly typical bounded highest weight modules of \mathfrak g.
