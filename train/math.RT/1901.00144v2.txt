When G is a real reductive group and G_0 is its Cartan motion group, the Mackey-Higson bijection is a natural one-to-one correspondence between all irreducible tempered representations of G and all irreducible unitary representations of G_0. In this short note, we collect some known facts about the topology of the tempered dual \widetilde{G} and that of the unitary dual \widehat{G_0}, then verify that the Mackey-Higson bijection \widetilde{G} \to \widehat{G_0} is continuous.
