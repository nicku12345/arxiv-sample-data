For the algebraic group SL_{l+1}(\mathbb{C}) we describe a system of positive roots associated to conjugacy classes in its Weyl group. Using this we explicitly describe the algebra of regular functions on certain transverse slices to conjugacy classes in SL_{l+1}(\mathbb{C}) as a polynomial algebra of invariants. These may be viewed as an algebraic group analogue of certain graded parabolic invariants that generate the (graded) W-algebra in type A.
