In this paper we give a complete description of the Howe correspondence of unipotent characters for a finite dual pair of a symplectic group and an even orthogonal group in terms of the Lusztig parametrization under a mild restriction of the characteristic of the base field. That is, the conjecture by Aubert-Michel-Rouquier is confirmed.
