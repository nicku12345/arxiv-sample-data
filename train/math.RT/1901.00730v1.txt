Let G be an almost linear Nash group, namely, a Nash group which admits a Nash homomorphism with finite kernel to some \GL_k(\mathbb R). A homology theory (the Schwartz homology) is established for the category of smooth \Fre representations of G of moderate growth. Frobenius reciprocity and Shapiro's lemma are proved in this category. As an application, we give a criterion for automatic extensions of Schwartz homologies of Schwartz sections of a tempered G-vector bundle.
