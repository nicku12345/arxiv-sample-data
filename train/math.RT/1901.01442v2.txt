Baer's Criterion for Injectivity is a basic tool of the theory of modules and complexes of modules. Its dual version (DBC) is known to hold for all right perfect rings, but its validity for non-right perfect rings is a complex problem (first formulated by Faith in 1976 \cite{F}). Recently, it has turned out that there are two classes of non-right perfect rings: 1. those for which DBC fails in ZFC, and 2. those for which DBC is independent of ZFC. First examples of rings in the latter class were constructed in \cite{T4}; here, we show that this class contains all small semiartinian von Neumann regular rings with primitive factors artinian.
