Hardy's type uncertainty principle on connected nilpotent Lie groups for the Fourier transform is proved. An analogue of Hardy's theorem for Gabor transform has been established for connected and simply connected nilpotent Lie groups. Finally Beurling's theorem for Gabor transform is discussed for groups of the form \mathbb{R}_n \times K, where K is a compact group
