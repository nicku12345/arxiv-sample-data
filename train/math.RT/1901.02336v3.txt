For a Coxeter system and a representation V of this Coxeter system, Soergel defined a category which is now called the category of Soergel bimodules and proved that this gives a categorification of the Hecke algebra when V is reflection faithful. Elias and Williamson defined another category even when V is not reflection faithful and they proved that this category is equivalent to the category of Soergel bimodules when V is reflection faithful. Moreover they proved the categorification theorem for their category with less assumptions on V. In this paper, we give a "bimodule theoretic" definition of the category of Elias-Williamson and reprove the categorification theorem.
