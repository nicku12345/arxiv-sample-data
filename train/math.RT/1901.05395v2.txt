We present a classification of all spherical indecomposable representations of classical and exceptional Lie superalgebras. We also include information about stabilizers, symmetric algebras, and Borels for which sphericity is achieved. In one such computation, the symmetric algebra of the standard module of \mathfrak{osp}(m|2n) is computed, which in particular gives the representation-theoretic structure of polynomials on the complex supersphere.
