In this paper the authors produce a projective indecomposable module for the Frobenius kernel of a simple algebraic group in characteristic p that is not the restriction of an indecomposable tilting module. This yields a counterexample to Donkin's longstanding Tilting Module Conjecture. The authors also produce a Weyl module that does not admit a p-Weyl filtration. This answers an old question of Jantzen, and also provides a counterexample to the (p,r)-Filtration Conjecture.
