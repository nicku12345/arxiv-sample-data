Given a finite group G, its double Burnside ring B(G,G), has a natural duality operation that arises from considering opposite (G,G)-bisets. In this article, we systematically study the subgroup of units of B(G,G), where elements are inverse to their dual, so called orthogonal units. We show the existence of an inflation map that embeds the group of orthogonal units of B(G/N,G/N) into the group of orthogonal units of B(G,G), when N is a normal subgroup of G, and study some properties and consequences. In particular, we use these maps to determine the orthogonal units of B(G,G), when G is a cyclic p-group, and p is an odd prime.
