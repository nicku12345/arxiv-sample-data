For the p-dimensional filiform Lie algebra {\mathfrak m}_2(p) over a field {\mathbb F} of prime characteristic p\ge 5 with nonzero Lie brackets [e_1,e_i] = e_{i+1} for 1<i<p and [e_2,e_i]=e_{i+2} for 2<i<p-1, we show that there is a family {\mathfrak m}_2^{\lambda}(p) of restricted Lie algebra structures parameterized by elements \lambda \in {\mathbb F}^p. We explicitly describe bases for the ordinary and restricted 1- and 2-cohomology spaces with trivial coefficients, and give formulas for the bracket and [p]-operations in the corresponding restricted one-dimensional central extensions.
