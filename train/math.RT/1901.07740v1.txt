In this article, we consider a dual pair (G, G') in the symplectic group Sp(W) with G compact and let (\tilde{G}, \tilde{G}') be the preimages of G and G' in the metaplectic group \widetilde{Sp(W)}. For every irreducible representation \Pi of \tilde{G} appearing in Howe correspondence, we compute explicitly the restriction of the character \Theta_{\Pi'} of the associated representation \Pi' of \tilde{G}' on the set of regular points on the compact Cartan subgroup \tilde{H}' of \tilde{G}'.
