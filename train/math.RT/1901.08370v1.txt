The family of Deligne tensor categories \mathrm{Rep}(GL_t) is obtained from the categories \mathbf{Rep}~GL(n) of finite dimensional representations of groups GL(n) by interpolating the integer parameter n to complex values. Therefore, it is a valuable tool for generalizing classical statements of representation theory. In this work we introduce and prove the generalization of Olshanski's centralizer construction of the Yangian Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n). Namely, we prove that for generic t\in\mathbb{C} the centralizer subalgebra of GL_t-invariants in the universal enveloping algebra U(\mathfrak{gl_{t+n}}) is the tensor product of Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n) and the center of U(\mathfrak{gl_{t}}). The main feature of this construction is that it does not involve passing to a limit, contrary to the original construction of Olshanski.
