APR tilts for path algebra kQ can be realized as the mutation of the quiver Q in \mathbb Z Q with respect to the translation. In this paper, we show that we have similar results for the quadratic dual of truncations of n-translation algebras, that is, under certain condition, the n-APR tilts of such algebras are realized as \tau-mutations.For the dual \tau-slice algebras with bound quiver Q^{\perp}, we show that their iterated n-APR tilts are realized by the iterated \tau-mutations in \mathbb Z|{n-1}Q^{\perp}.
