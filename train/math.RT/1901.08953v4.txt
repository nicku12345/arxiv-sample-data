Let \mathscr{C} be a 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated category, and let \mathscr{T} be a cluster tilting subcategory of \mathscr{C}. An important result from Dehy and Keller tells us that a rigid object c \in \mathscr{C} is uniquely defined by its index with respect to \mathscr{T}.   The notion of triangulated categories extends to the notion of (d+2)-angulated categories. Thanks to a paper by Oppermann and Thomas, we now have a definition for cluster tilting subcategories in higher dimensions. This paper proves that under a technical assumption, an indecomposable object in a (d+2)-angulated category is uniquely defined by its index with respect to a higher dimensional cluster tilting subcategory. We also demonstrate an application of this result in higher dimensional cluster categories.
