We define the degenerate two boundary affine Hecke-Clifford algebra \mathcal{H}_d, and show it admits a well-defined \mathfrak{q}(n)-linear action on the tensor space M\otimes N\otimes V^{\otimes d}, where V is the natural module for \mathfrak{q}(n), and M, N are arbitrary modules for \mathfrak{q}(n), the Lie superalgebra of Type Q. When M and N are irreducible highest weight modules parameterized by a staircase partition and a single row, respectively, this action factors through a quotient of \mathcal{H}_d. We then construct explicit modules for this quotient, \mathcal{H}_{p,d}, using combinatorial tools such as shifted tableaux and the Bratteli graph. These modules belong to a family of modules which we call calibrated. Using the relations in \mathcal{H}_{p,d}, we also classify a specific class of calibrated modules. The irreducible summands of M\otimes N\otimes V^{\otimes d} coincide with the combinatorial construction, and provide a weak version of the Schur-Weyl type duality.
