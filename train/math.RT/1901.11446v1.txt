A quantum symmetric pair consists of a quantum group \mathbf U and its coideal subalgebra {\mathbf U}^{\imath}_{\varsigma} with parameters \varsigma (called an \imathquantum group). We initiate a Hall algebra approach for the categorification of \imathquantum groups. A universal \imathquantum group \widetilde{\mathbf U}^{\imath} is introduced and {\mathbf U}^{\imath}_{\varsigma} is recovered by a central reduction of \widetilde{\mathbf U}^{\imath}. The modified Ringel-Hall algebras of the first author and Peng, which are closely related to semi-derived Hall algebras of Gorsky and motivated by Bridgeland's work, are extended to the setting of 1-Gorenstein algebras, as shown in Appendix~A by the first author. A new class of 1-Gorenstein algebras (called \imathquiver algebras) arising from acyclic quivers with involutions is introduced. The modified Ringel-Hall algebras for the Dynkin \imathquiver algebras are shown to be isomorphic to the universal quasi-split \imathquantum groups of finite type, and a reduced version provides a categorification of {\mathbf U}^{\imath}_{\varsigma}. Monomial bases and PBW bases for these Hall algebras and \imathquantum groups are constructed. In the special case of quivers of diagonal type, our construction reduces to a reformulation of Bridgeland's Hall algebra realization of quantum groups.
