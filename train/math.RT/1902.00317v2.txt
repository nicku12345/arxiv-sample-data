In this note, we prove that if \Lambda is an Artin algebra with a simple module S of finite projective dimension, then the finiteness of the finitistic dimension of \Lambda implies that of (1-e)\Lambda(1-e) where e is the primitive idempotent supporting S. We derive some consequences of this. In particular, we recover a result of Green-Solberg-Psaroudakis: if \Lambda is the quotient of a path algebra by an admissible ideal I whose defining relations do not involve a certain arrow \alpha, then the finitistic dimension of \Lambda is finite if and only if the finitistic dimension of \Lambda/\Lambda\alpha \Lambda is finite.
