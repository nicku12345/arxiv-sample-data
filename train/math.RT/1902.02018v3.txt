Let G be the unramified unitary group U(2, 1)(E/F) defined over a non-archimedean local field F of odd residue characteristic p, and B be the standard Borel subgroup of G. In this note, we study the problem of the restriction of irreducible smooth \overline{\mathbf{F}}_p-representations of G to B, and we obtain various results which are analogous to that of Pa\check{\text{s}}k\bar{\text{u}}nas on GL_2 (F) (\cite{Pas07}).
