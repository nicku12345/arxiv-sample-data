We associate to an arbitrary positive root \alpha of a complex semisimple finite-dimensional Lie algebra \mfrak{g} a twisting endofunctor T_\alpha of the category of \mfrak{g}-modules. We apply this functor to generalized Verma modules in the category \mcal{O}(\mfrak{g}) and construct a family of \alpha-Gelfand--Tsetlin modules with finite \Gamma_\alpha-multiplicities, where \Gamma_{\alpha} is a commutative \C-subalgebra of the universal enveloping algebra of \mfrak{g} generated by a Cartan subalgebra of \mfrak{g} and by the Casimir element of the \mfrak{sl}(2)-subalgebra corresponding to the root \alpha. This covers classical results of Andersen and Stroppel when \alpha is a simple root and previous results of the authors in the case when \mfrak{g} is a complex simple Lie algebra and \alpha is the maximal root of \mfrak{g}. The significance of constructed modules is that they are Gelfand--Tsetlin modules with respect to any commutative \C-subalgebra of the universal enveloping algebra of \mfrak{g} containing \Gamma_\alpha. Using the Beilinson--Bernstein correspondence we give a geometric realization of these modules together with their explicit description. We also identify a tensor subcategory of the category of \alpha-Gelfand--Tsetlin modules which contains constructed modules as well as the category \mcal{O}(\mfrak{g}).
