For each partition \tau of N there are irreducible modules of the symmetric groups \mathcal{S}_{N} or the corresponding Hecke algebra \mathcal{H}_{N}\left( t\right)  whose bases consist of reverse standard Young tableaux of shape \tau. There are associated spaces of nonsymmetric Jack and Macdonald polynomials taking values in these modules, respectively.The Jack polynomials are a special case of those constructed by Griffeth for the infinite family G\left( n,p,N\right)  of complex reflection groups. The Macdonald polynomials were constructed by Luque and the author. For both the group \mathcal{S}_{N} and the Hecke algebra \mathcal{H}_{N}\left( t\right)  there is a commutative set of Dunkl operators. The Jack and the Macdonald polynomials are parametrized by \kappa and \left( q,t\right)  respectively. For certain values of the parameters (called singular values) there are polynomials annihilated by each Dunkl operator; these are called singular polynomials. This paper analyzes the singular polynomials whose leading term is x_{1}^{m}\otimes S, where S is an arbitrary reverse standard Young tableau of shape \tau. The singular values depend on properties of the edge of the Ferrers diagram of \tau.
