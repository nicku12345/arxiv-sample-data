We introduce the alternating Schur algebra AS_F(n,d) as the commutant of the action of the alternating group A_d on the d-fold tensor power of an n-dimensional F-vector space. When F has characteristic different from 2, we give a basis of AS_F(n,d) in terms of bipartite graphs, and a graphical interpretation of the structure constants. We introduce the abstract Koszul duality functor on modules for the even part of any \mathbf Z/2\mathbf Z-graded algebra. The algebra AS_F(n,d) is \mathbf Z/2\mathbf Z-graded, having the classical Schur algebra S_F(n,d) as its even part. This leads to an approach to Koszul duality for S_F(n,d)-modules that is amenable to combinatorial methods. We characterize the category of AS_F(n,d)-modules in terms of S_F(n,d)-modules and their Koszul duals. We use the graphical basis of AS_F(n,d) to study the dependence of the behavior of derived Koszul duality on n and d.
