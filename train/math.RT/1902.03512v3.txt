We study non-standard Verma type modules over the Kac-Moody queer Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{q}(n)^{(2)}. We give a sufficient condition under which such modules are irreducible. We also give a classification of all irreducible diagonal \mathbb{Z}-graded modules over certain Heisenberg Lie superalgebras contained in \mathfrak{q}(n)^{(2)}.
