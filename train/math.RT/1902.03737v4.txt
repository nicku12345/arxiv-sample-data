In this paper, we give criteria on \tau-tilting finiteness for two kinds of two-point algebras. Moreover, we show the \tau-tilting finiteness of some algebras, such as the (infinite-)tame block algebras of Hecke algebras of classical type over an algebraically closed field of characteristic not equal to 2, and the algebras from Table T and Table W introduced by Han [19].
