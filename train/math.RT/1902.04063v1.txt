We introduce general weighted surface algebras of triangulated surfaces with arbitrarily oriented triangles and describe their basic properties. In particular, we prove that all these algebras, except the singular disc, triangle, tetrahedral and spherical algebras, are symmetric tame periodic algebras of period 4.
