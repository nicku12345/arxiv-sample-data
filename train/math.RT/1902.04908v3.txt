We generalize the concept of the group determinant and prove a necessary and sufficient novel condition for a subset to be a subgroup. This development is based on the group determinant work by Edward Formanek, David Sibley, and Richard Mansfield, where they show that two groups with the same group determinant are isomorphic. The derived condition leads to a generalization of this result.
