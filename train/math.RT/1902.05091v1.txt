We prove that each exotic fusion system \mathcal F on a Sylow p-subgroup of G_2(p) for an odd prime p with \mathcal O_p(\mathcal F)=1 is block-exotic. This gives evidence for the conjecture that each exotic fusion system is block-exotic. We prove two reduction theorems for block-realisable fusion systems.
