In this paper we give the description of generic representations of metaplectic groups over p-adic fields in terms of their Langlands parameters and calculate their theta lifts on all levels for any tower of odd orthogonal groups. We also describe precisely all the occurrences of the failure of the standard module conjecture for metaplectic groups.
