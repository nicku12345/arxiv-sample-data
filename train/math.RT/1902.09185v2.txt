In this paper, we study a relationship between tilting modules with finite projective dimension and dominant dimension with respect to injective modules as a generalisation of results of Crawley-Boevey--Sauter, Nguyen--Reiten--Todorov--Zhu and Pressland--Sauter. Moreover, we give characterisations of n-almost Auslander--Gorenstein algebras and n-almost Auslander algebras by the existence of tilting modules. As an application, we describe a sufficient condition of 1-almost Auslander algebras to be strongly quasi-hereditary by comparing such tilting modules and characteristic tilting modules.
