We show that the characters of tilting modules can be used, in a concrete and explicit way, to obtain the simple characters of a connected reductive algebraic group G over an algebraically closed field \Bbbk of characteristic p, for all p. Thus, once a formula for the characters of the indecomposable tilting G-modules has been found, a formula for the simple modules has been also. An immediate implication is that the work of Achar, Makisumi, Riche, and Williamson in \cite{AMRW} provides a character formula for simple G-modules when p>h, the Coxeter number of G.
