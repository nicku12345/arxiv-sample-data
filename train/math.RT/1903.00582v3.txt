We study second adjointness in the context of tempered admissible representations of a real reductive group. Compared to a recent result of Crisp and Higson, this generalizes from SL_2 to a general group, but specializes to only considering admissible representations. We also discuss Casselman's canonical pairing in this context, and the relation to Bernstein morphisms. Additionally, we take the opportunity to discuss some relevant functors and some of their relations.
