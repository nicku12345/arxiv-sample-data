In this article, we decompose the ring of regular functions on the nilpotent orbit of dimension 8 for the complex G_2 in which every irreducible representation of G_2 appears exactly once. This confirms the predication of McGovern and we have shown that his proposed representation attaching to this orbit is unitarizable.
