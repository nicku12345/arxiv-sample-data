For a smooth irreducible affine algebraic variety we study a class of gauge modules admitting compatible actions of both the algebra A of functions and the Lie algebra \mathcal{V} of vector fields on the variety. We prove that a gauge module corresponding to a simple \mathfrak{gl}_N-module is irreducible as a module over the Lie algebra of vector fields unless it appears in the de Rham complex.
