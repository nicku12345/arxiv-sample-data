Let G be a connected reductive group over a finite field \mathfrak{f} of order q. When q is small, we make further assumptions on G. Then we determine precisely when G(\mathfrak{f}) admits irreducible, cuspidal representations that are self-dual, of Deligne-Lusztig type, or both. Finally, we outline some consequences for the existence of self-dual supercuspidal representations of reductive p-adic groups.
