Triangulated categories coming from cyclic posets were originally introduced by the authors in [IT15b] as a generalization of the constructions of various triangulated categories with cluster structures. We give an overview, then analyze triangulation clusters which are those corresponding to topological triangulations of the 2-disk. Locally finite non-triangulation clusters give topological triangulations of the cactus space associated to the cactus cyclic poset.
