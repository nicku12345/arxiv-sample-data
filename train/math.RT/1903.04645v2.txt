We introduce a method "syzygy filtration" to give building blocks of syzygies appearing in projective resolutions of indecomposable \Lambda-modules where \Lambda is a cyclic Nakayama algebra. We interpret homological invariants of \Lambda including left and right finitistic dimension, left and right \varphi-dimension, Gorenstein dimension, dominant dimension and their upper bounds in terms of this new filtration. For all of them, we obtain a unified upper bound 2r where r is the number of relations defining the algebra \Lambda. We give a simpler proof of theorem relating Gorenstein dimension to \varphi-dimension. Moreover we show that \varphi\dim\Lambda-fin.dim\Lambda\leq 1.
