We establish a closed formula for a singular vector of weight \lambda-\beta in the Verma module of highest weight \lambda for Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{gl}(m|n) when \lambda is atypical with respect to an odd positive root \beta. It is further shown that this vector is unique up to a scalar multiple, and it descends to a singular vector, again unique up to a scalar multiple, in the corresponding Kac module when both \lambda and \lambda-\beta are dominant integral.
