This work provides the first step toward the classification of irreducible finite weight modules over twisted affine Lie superalgebras. We study all such modules whether the canonical central element acts as a nonzero multiple of the identity map or not. Moreover, we reduce the classification of some subclasses of irreducible finite weight modules to the classification of cuspidal modules of finite dimensional cuspidal superalgebras which is known by a work of Dimitrov, Mathieu and Penkov.
