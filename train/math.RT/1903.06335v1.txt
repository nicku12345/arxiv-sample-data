Let G be the split orthogonal group of degree 2n over an arbitrary infinite field \mathbb{F} of chararcteristic not 2. In this paper, we classify multiple flag varieties G/P_1\times\cdots\times G/P_k of finite type. Here a multiple flag variety is said to be of finite type if it has a finite number of G-orbits with respect to the diagonal action of G.
