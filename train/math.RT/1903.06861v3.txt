Up to equivalence, this paper classifies all the irreducible unitary representations with non-zero Dirac cohomology for the simple Lie group E_{6(-14)}, which is of Hermitian symmetric type. Each FS-scattered Dirac series of E_{6(-14)} is realized as a composition factor of certain A_{\mathfrak{q}}(\lambda) module. Along the way, we have also obtained all the fully supported irreducible unitary representations of E_{6(-14)} with integral infinitesimal characters.
