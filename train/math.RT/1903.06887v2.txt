Given a regular supercuspidal representation \rho of the Levi subgroup M of a standard parabolic subgroup P=MN in a connected reductive group G defined over a non-archimedean local field F, we serve you a Rodier type structure theorem which provides us a geometrical parametrization of the set JH(Ind^G_P(\rho)) of Jordan--H{\"o}lder constituents of the Harish-Chandra parabolic induction representation Ind^G_P(\rho), vastly generalizing Rodier structure theorem for P=B=TU Borel subgroup of a connected split reductive group about 40 years ago. Our novel contribution is to overcome the essential difficulty that the relative Weyl group W_M=N_G(M)/M is not a coxeter group in general, as opposed to the well-known fact that the Weyl group W_T=N_G(T)/T is a coxeter group. Indeed, such a beautiful structure theorem also holds for finite central covering groups.
