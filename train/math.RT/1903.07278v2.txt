We obtain an irreducibility criterion for generalized principal series, extending known and frequently employed results for principal series. Our approach rests on a newly observed semi-direct product decomposition of the relative Weyl group and its action on generalized principal series, in conjunction with the theory of Jacquet module. We thus circumvent the obstacle that the Weyl group of a general Levi subgroup is not a Coxeter group. Our statements on irreducibility are formulated in terms of a subgroup of the Knapp--Stein R-group, which arises naturally from our decomposition of the Weyl group. The novel subgroup allows us to state a conjecture on general parabolic induction of arbitrary irreducible admissible representations as opposed to generalized principal series, which are associated with supercuspidal ones.
