For an arbitrary finite-dimensional algebra A, we introduce a general approach to determining when its first Hochschild cohomology {\rm HH}^1(A), considered as a Lie algebra, is solvable. If A is moreover of tame or finite representation type, we are able to describe {\rm HH}^1(A) as the direct sum of a solvable Lie algebra and a sum of copies of \mathfrak{sl}_2. We proceed to determine the exact number of such copies, and give an explicit formula for this number in terms of certain chains of Kronecker subquivers of the quiver of A. As a corollary, we obtain a precise answer to a question posed by Chaparro, Schroll and Solotar.
