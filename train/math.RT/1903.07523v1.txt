Let k be an algebraically closed field, \mathop{char}(k) = p \geq 2 and E_r be a p-elementary abelian group of rank r \geq 2. Let (c,d) \in \mathbb{N}^2. We show that there exists an indecomposable module of constant Jordan type [1]^c [2]^d and Loewy length 2 if and only if q_{\Gamma_r}(d,d+c) \leq 1 and c \geq r-1, where q_{\Gamma_r}(x,y) := x^2 + y^2-rxy denotes the Tits form of the generalized Kronecker quiver \Gamma_r. Since p > 2 and constant Jordan type [1]^c [2]^d imply Loewy length \leq 2, we get in this case the full classification of Jordan types [1]^c [2]^d that arise from indecomposable modules.
