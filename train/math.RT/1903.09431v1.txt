Let \mathfrak{p} be a parabolic subalgebra of \mathfrak{sl}(V) of maximal dimension and let \mathfrak{n} \subset \mathfrak{p} be the corresponding nilradical. In this paper we classify the set of \mathfrak{sl}(V)-modules whose restriction to U(\mathfrak{n}) is free of rank 1. It turns out that isomorphism classes of such modules are parametrized by polynomials in \dim V-1 variables. We determine the submodule structure for these modules and we show that they generically are simple.
