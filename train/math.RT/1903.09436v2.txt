Arthur classified the discrete automorphic representations of symplectic and orthogonal groups over a number field by that of the general linear groups. In this classification, those that are not from endoscopic lifting correspond to pairs (\phi, b), where \phi is an irreducible unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of some general linear group and b is an integer. In this paper, we study the local components of these automorphic representations at a nonarchimedean place, and we give a complete description of them in terms of their Langlands parameters.
