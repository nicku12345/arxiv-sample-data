Given a supercuspidal representation \sigma of a parabolic subgroup P of reductive group G, we discover a universal hierarchical structure of reducibility of the parabolic induction Ind^G_P(\sigma), i.e. always irreducible from some Levi-level up. As its applications, we provide a new simple proof of the generic irreducibility property of parabolic induction, and prove Clozel's finiteness conjecture of special exponents under some conditions. Indeed, those conditions are predicted by two conjectures of Shahidi which in some sense are proved for classical groups by Arthur in his monumental book--The Endoscopic Classification of Representations: Orthogonal and Symplectic Groups. At last, naturally, such type simple beautiful structure theorem should be conjectured to hold in general, i.e. if the "reducibility conditions" of a general parabolic induction lies in some Levi subgroup, then it is always irreducible from this Levi up.
