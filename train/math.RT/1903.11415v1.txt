It is well known that if G/K is any irreducible symmetric space and \mu _{a} is a continuous orbital measure supported on the double coset KaK, then the convolution product, \mu _{a}^{k}, is absolutely continuous for some suitably large k\leq \dim G/K. The minimal value of k is known in some symmetric spaces and in the special case of groups or rank one symmetric spaces it has even been shown that \mu _{a}^{k} belongs to the smaller space L^{2} for some k. Here we prove that this L^{2} property holds for all the compact, complex Grassmanian symmetric spaces, % SU(p+q)/S(U(p)\times U(q)). Moreover, for the orbital measures at a dense set of points a, we prove that \mu _{a}^{2}\in L^{2} (or \mu _{a}^{3}\in L^{2} if p=q).
