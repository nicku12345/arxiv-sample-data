In this paper we face the study of the representations of the exceptional Lie superalgebra E(5,10). We recall the construction of generalized Verma modules and give a combinatorial description of the restriction to sl_5 of the Verma module induced by the trivial representation. We use this description to classify morphisms between Verma modules of degree one, two and three proving in these cases a conjecture given by Rudakov. A key tool is the notion of dual morphism between Verma modules.
