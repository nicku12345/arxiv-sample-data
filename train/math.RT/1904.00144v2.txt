The purpose of this paper is to study the local zeta integrals of Friedberg-Jacquet at complex place and to establish similar results to our recent work in the reall case joint with C. Cheng and D. Jiang. In this paper, we will (1) give a necessary and sufficient condition on an irreducible essentially tempered cohomological representation \pi of \mathrm{GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}) with a non-zero Shalika model; (2) construct a new twisted linear period \Lambda_{s,\chi}; (3) give a necessary and sufficient condition on the character \chi such that there exists a uniform cohomological test vector v\in V_\pi (which we construct explicitly) for \Lambda_{s,\chi}. As a consequence, we obtain the non-vanishing of local Friedberg-Jacquet integral at complex place. All of the above are essential preparations for attacking a global period relation problem.
