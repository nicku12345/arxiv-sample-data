For real reductive groups, we prove that a morphism of L-groups which preserves regular unipotent elements respects cohomological A-parameters. This allows us to give a complete understanding of cohomological A-parameters for all real classical groups. Along the way we elucidate cohomological A-parameters for all real reductive groups. We construct Langlands parameters of tempered cohomological representations of all real reductive groups, and give a complete list of cohomological unitary representations of GL_n({\mathbb R}), a result which is due to B. Speh when the coefficient system is trivial. The latter result is crucial for us as we go from cohomological representations of GL_n({\mathbb R}) to cohomological representations of classical groups. The paper ends with a section where we prove that the sum of the ranks of cohomology groups in an A-packet on any real group (and any infinitesimal character) is independent of the A-packet under consideration, and can be explicitly calculated. This result when summed over all pure innerforms has a particularly nice form.
