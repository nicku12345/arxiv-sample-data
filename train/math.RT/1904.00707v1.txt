Permutation modules play an important role in the representation theory of the symmetric group. Hartmann and Paget defined permutation modules for non-degenerate Brauer algebras. We generalise their construction to a wider class of algebras, namely cellularly stratified algebras, satisfying certain conditions. Partition algebras are shown to satisfy these conditions, provided the characteristic of the underlying field is large enough. Thus we obtain a definition of permutation modules for partition algebras.
