We prove that generic higher Deligne-Lusztig representations over truncated formal power series are non-nilpotent, when the parameters are non-trivial on the biggest reduction kernel of the centre; we also establish a relation between the orbits of higher Deligne-Lusztig representations of \mathrm{SL}_n and of \mathrm{GL}_n. Then we introduce a combinatorial analogue of Deligne-Lusztig construction for general and special linear groups over local rings; this construction generalises the higher Deligne--Lusztig representations and affords all the nilpotent orbit representations, and for \mathrm{GL}_n it also affords all the regular orbit representations as well as the invariant characters of the Lie algebra.
