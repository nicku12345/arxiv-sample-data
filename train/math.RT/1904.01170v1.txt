In this paper, we realize polynomial \H-modules \Omega(\lambda,\alpha,\beta) from irreducible twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro modules \A_{\alpha,\beta}. It follows from \H-modules \Omega(\lambda,\alpha,\beta) and \mathrm{Ind}(M) that we obtain a class of natural non-weight tensor product modules \big(\bigotimes_{i=1}^m\Omega(\lambda_i,\alpha_i,\beta_i)\big)\otimes \mathrm{Ind}(M). Then we give the necessary and sufficient conditions under which these modules are irreducible and isomorphic, and also give that the irreducible modules in this class are new.
