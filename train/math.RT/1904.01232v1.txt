The Morita equivalences of classical Brauer algebras and classical Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras have been well studied. Here we study the Morita equivalence problems on these two kinds of algebras of simply-laced type, especially for them with the generic parameters. We show that Brauer algebras and Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras of simply-laced type are Morita equivalent to the direct sums of some group algebras of Coxeter groups and some Hecke algebras of some Coxeter groups, respectively.
