Given r \in \mathbf{N}, let \lambda be a partition of r with at most two parts. Let \mathbf{F} be a field of characteristic 3. Write M^\lambda for the \mathbf{F}S_r-permutation module corresponding to the action of the symmetric group S_r on the cosets of the maximal Young subgroup S_\lambda. We construct a full set of central primitive idempotents in \text{End}_{\mathbf{F} S_r}(M^\lambda) in this case. We also determine the Young module corresponding to each primitive idempotent that we construct.
