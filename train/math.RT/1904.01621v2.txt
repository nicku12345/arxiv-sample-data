Recently the authors initiated an \imathHall algebra approach to (universal) \imathquantum groups arising from quantum symmetric pairs. In this paper we construct and study BGP type reflection functors which lead to isomorphisms of the \imathHall algebras associated to acyclic \imathquivers. For Dynkin quivers, these symmetries on \imathHall algebras induce automorphisms of universal \imathquantum groups, which are shown to satisfy the braid group relations associated to the restricted Weyl group of a symmetric pair; conjecturally these continue to hold for acyclic quivers/Kac-Moody setting. This leads to a conceptual construction of q-root vectors and PBW bases for (universal) quasi-split \imathquantum groups of ADE type.
