Let a be a real euclidean vector space of finite dimension and \Sigma a root system in a with a basis \Delta. Let \Theta \subset \Delta and M = M_{\Theta} be a standard Levi of a reductive group G such that a_\Theta = a_M / a_G. Let us denote d the dimension of a_\Theta, i.e the cardinal of \Delta - \Theta and \Sigma_{\Theta} the set of all non-trivial projections of roots in \Sigma. We obtain conditions on \Theta such that \Sigma_\Theta contains a root system of rank d.
