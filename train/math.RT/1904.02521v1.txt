Let G be the special linear group of degree 2 over an algebraically closed field K. Let E be the natural module and S^rE the rth symmetric power. We consider here, for r,s\geq 0, the tensor product of S^rE and the dual of S^sE. In characteristic zero this tensor product decomposes according to the Clebsch-Gordan formula. We consider here the situation when K is a field of positive characteristic. We show that each indecomposable component occurs with multiplicity one and identify which modules occur for given r and s.
