Let \mathbb{X} be a weighted projective line of tubular type and \operatorname{coh}\mathbb{X} the category of coherent sheaves on \mathbb{X}. The main purpose of this note is to show that the subgraph of the tilting graph consisting of all basic tilting bundles in \operatorname{coh}\mathbb{X} is connected. This yields an alternative proof for the connectedness of the tilting graph of \operatorname{coh}\mathbb{X}. Our approach leads to the investigation of the change of slopes of a tilting sheaf in \operatorname{coh}\mathbb{X} under (co-)APR mutations, which may be of independent interest.
