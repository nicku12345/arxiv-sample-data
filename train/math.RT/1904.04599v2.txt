Exceptional cycles in a triangulated category \mathcal T with Serre duality, introduced by N. Broomhead, D. Pauksztello, and D. Ploog, have a notable impact on the global structure of \mathcal T. In this paper we show that if \mathcal T is homotopy-like, then any exceptional 1-cycle is indecomposable and at the mouth; and any object in an exceptional n-cycle with n\ge 3 is at the mouth. Let A be an indecomposable gentle k-algebra with A\ne k. The Hom spaces between string complexes at the mouth are explicitly determined. The main result classifies "almost all" the exceptional cycles in K^b(A\mbox{-}{\rm proj}), using characteristic components and their AG-invariants, except those exceptional 1-cycles which are band complexes. Namely, the mouth of a characteristic component C of K^b(A\mbox{-}{\rm proj}) forms a unique exceptional cycle in C, up to an equivalent relation \approx; if the quiver of A is not of type A_3, this gives all the exceptional n-cycle in K^b(A\mbox{-}{\rm proj}) with n\ge 2, up to \approx; and a string complex is an exceptional 1-cycle if and only if it is at the mouth of a characteristic component with {\rm AG}-invariant (1, m). However, a band complex at the mouth is possibly not an exceptional 1-cycle.
