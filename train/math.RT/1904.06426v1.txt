In this note, given a pair (\mathfrak{g}, \lambda), where \mathfrak{g} is a complex semisimple Lie algebra and \lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^* is a dominant integral weight of \mathfrak{g}, where \mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g} is the real span of the coroots inside a fixed Cartan subalgebra, we associate an SU(2) and Weyl equivariant smooth map f: X \to (P^m(\mathbb{C}))^n, where X \subset \mathfrak{h} \otimes \mathbb{R}^3 is the configuration space of regular triples in \mathfrak{h}, and m, n depend on the initial data (\mathfrak{g}, \lambda).   We conjecture that, for any \mathbf{x} \in X, the rank of f(\mathbf{x}) is at least the rank of a collinear configuration in X (collinear when viewed as an ordered r-tuple of points in \mathbb{R}^3, with r being the rank of \mathfrak{g}). A stronger conjecture is also made using the singular values of a matrix representing f(\mathbf{x}).   This work is a generalization of the Atiyah-Sutcliffe problem to a Lie-theoretic setting.
