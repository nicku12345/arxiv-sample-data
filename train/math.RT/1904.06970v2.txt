Let G(q) be a finite group of Lie type over a field with q elements, where q is a prime power. The Green functions of G(q), as defined by Deligne and Lusztig, are known in \textit{almost} all cases by work of Beynon--Spaltenstein, Lusztig und Shoji. Open cases exist for groups of exceptional type {^2\!E}_6, E_7, E_8 in small characteristics. We propose a general method for dealing with these cases, which procedes by a reduction to the case where q is a prime and then uses computer algebra techniques. In this way, all open cases in type {^2\!E}_6, E_7 are solved, as well as at least one particular open case in type E_8.
