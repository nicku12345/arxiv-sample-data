Inspired by the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture and the descent problem for classical groups, in this paper we study the descents of unipotent representations of unitary groups over finite fields. We give the first descents of unipotent representations explicitly, which are unipotent as well. Our results include both the Bessel case and Fourier-Jacobi case, which are related via theta correspondence.
