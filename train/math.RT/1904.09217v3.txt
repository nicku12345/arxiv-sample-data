Motivated by questions in the study of relative trace formulae, we construct a generalization of Grothendieck's simultaneous resolution over the regular locus of certain symmetric pairs. We use this space to prove a relative version of results of Donagi and Gaitsgory about the automorphism sheaf of regular stabilizers. We also obtain partial results toward applications in Springer theory for symmetric spaces.
