We give an action of the Hecke category on the principal block \mathrm{Rep}_0(G_1T) of G_1T-modules where G is a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0, T a maximal torus of G and G_1 the Frobenius kernel of G. To define it, we define a new category with a Hecke action which is equivalent to the combinatorial category defined by Andersen-Jantzen-Soergel.
