In this paper we treat the \tau-tilting finiteness of biserial (respectively special biserial) algebras over algebraically closed (respectively arbitrary) fields. Inside these families, to compare the notions of representation-finiteness and \tau-tilting finiteness, we reduce the problem to the \tau-tilting finiteness of minimal representation-infinite (special) biserial algebras. Building upon the classification of minimal representation-infinite algebras, we fully determine which minimal representation-infinite (special) biserial algebras are \tau-tilting finite and which ones are not. To do so, we use the brick-\tau-rigid correspondence of Demonet, Iyama and Jasso, and the classification of minimal representation-infinite special biserial algebras due to Ringel.   Furthermore, we introduce the notion of minimal \tau-tilting infinite algebras, analogous to the notion of minimal representation infinite algebras, and prove that a minimal representation-infinite (special) biserial algebra is minimal \tau-tilting infinite if and only if it is a gentle algebra. As a consequence, we conclude that a gentle algebra is \tau-tilting infinite if and only if it is representation infinite. We also show that for every minimal representation-infinite (special) biserial algebra, the notions of tilting finiteness and \tau-tilting finiteness are equivalent. This implies that a mild (special) biserial algebra is tilting finite if and only if it is brick finite.
