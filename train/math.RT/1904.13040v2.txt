Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0, \Delta(\lambda) denote the Weyl module of G of highest weight \lambda and \iota_{\lambda,\mu}:\Delta(\lambda+\mu)\to \Delta(\lambda)\otimes\Delta(\mu) be the canonical G-morphism. We study the split condition for \iota_{\lambda,\mu} over \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}, and apply this as an approach to compare the Jantzen filtrations of the Weyl modules \Delta(\lambda) and \Delta(\lambda+\mu). In the case when G is of type A, we show that the split condition is closely related to the product of certain Young symmetrizers and, under some mild conditions, is further characterized by the denominator of a certain Young's seminormal basis vector. We obtain explicit formulas for the split condition in some cases.
