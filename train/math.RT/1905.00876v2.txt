For a connected reductive group  G  defined over a number field  k , we construct the Schwartz space  \mathcal{S}(G(k)\backslash G(\mathbb{A})) . This space is an adelic version of Casselman's Schwartz space  \mathcal{S}(\Gamma\backslash G_\infty) , where  \Gamma  is a discrete subgroup of  G_\infty:=\prod_{v\in V_\infty}G(k_v) . We study the space of tempered distributions  \mathcal{S}(G(k)\backslash G(\mathbb A))'  and investigate applications to automorphic forms on  G(\mathbb A) . In particular, we study the representation  \left(r',\mathcal{S}(G(k)\backslash G(\mathbb{A}))'\right)  contragredient to the right regular representation  (r,\mathcal{S}(G(k)\backslash G(\mathbb{A})))  of  G(\mathbb{A})  and describe the closed irreducible admissible subrepresentations of  \mathcal{S}(G(k)\backslash G(\mathbb{A}))'  assuming that  G  is semisimple.
