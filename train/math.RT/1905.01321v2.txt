Let \mathbb{F} be a non-archimedean local field of positive characteristic different from 2. We consider distributions on \mathrm{GL}(n+1,\mathbb{F}) which are invariant under the adjoint action of \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{F}). We prove that any such distribution is invariant with respect to transposition. This implies that the restriction to \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{F}) of any irreducible smooth representation of \mathrm{GL}(n+1,\mathbb{F}) is multiplicity free.
