A duality theorem for the singularity category of a finite dimensional Gorenstein algebra is proved. It complements a duality on the category of perfect complexes, discovered by Happel. One of its consequences is an analogue of Serre duality, and the existence of Auslander-Reiten triangles for the \mathfrak{p}-local and \mathfrak{p}-torsion subcategories of the derived category, for each homogeneous prime ideal \mathfrak{p} arising from the action of a commutative ring via Hochschild cohomology.
