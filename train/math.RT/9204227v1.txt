Let M be a G-covering of a nilpotent orbit in \g where G is a complex semisimple Lie group and \g=\text{Lie}(G). We prove that under Poisson bracket the space R[2] of homogeneous functions on M of degree 2 is the unique maximal semisimple Lie subalgebra of R=R(M) containing \g. The action of \g'\simeq R[2] exponentiates to an action of the corresponding Lie group G' on a G'-cover M' of a nilpotent orbit in \g' such that M is open dense in M'. We determine all such pairs (\g\subset\g').
