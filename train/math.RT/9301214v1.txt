In this paper we study the reducibility, composition series and unitarity of the components of some degenerate principal series representations of \RMO(p,q), \RMU(p,q) and \SP(p,q). This is done by realizing these representations in paces of homogeneous functions on light cones and writing down the explicit actions of the universal enveloping algebra of the group concerned.
