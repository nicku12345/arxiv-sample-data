Let (G,V) be an irreducible prehomogeneous vector space defined over a number field k, P in k[V] a relative invariant polynomial, and X a rational character of G such that P(gx)=X(g)P(x). Let V_k^{ss}={x \in V_k such that P(x) is not equal to 0}. For x in V_k^{ss}, let G_x be the stabilizer of x, and G_x^0 the connected component of 1 of G_x. We define L_0 to be the set of x in V_k^{ss} such that G_x^0 does not have a non-trivial rational character. We study the zeta function for (G,V).
