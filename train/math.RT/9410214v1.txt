Let K be a compact connected Lie group acting unitarily on a finite-dimensional complex vector space V. One calls this a {\em multiplicity-free} action whenever the K-isotypic components of \C[V] are K-irreducible. We have shown that this is the case if and only if the moment map \tau:V\rightarrow\k^* for the action is finite-to-one on K-orbits. This is equivalent to a result concerning \gp s associated with Heisenberg groups that is motivated by the Orbit Method. Further details of this work will be published elsewhere.
