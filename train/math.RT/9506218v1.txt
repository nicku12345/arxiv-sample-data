If G is a (connected) complex Lie Group and Z is a generalized flag manifold for G, the the open orbits D of a (connected) real form G_0 of G form an interesting class of complex homogeneous spaces, which play an important role in the representation theory of G_0. We find that the group of automorphisms, i.e., the holomorphic diffeomorphisms, is a finite-dimensional Lie group, except for a small number of open orbits, where it is infinite dimensional. In the finite-dimensional case, we determine its structure. Our results have some consequences in representation theory.
