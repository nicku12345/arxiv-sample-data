We classify extended Poincar\'e Lie super algebras and Lie algebras of any signature (p,q), that is Lie super algebras and Z_2-graded Lie algebras g = g_0 + g_1, where g_0 = so(V) + V is the (generalized) Poincar\'e Lie algebra of the pseudo Euclidean vector space V = R^{p,q} of signature (p,q) and g_1 = S is the spinor so(V)-module extended to a g_0-module with kernel V. The remaining super commutators {g_1,g_1} (respectively, commutators [g_1, g_1]) are defined by an so(V)-equivariant linear mapping vee^2 g_1 -> V (respectively, wedge^2 g_1 -> V). Denote by P^+(n,s) (respectively, P^-(n,s)) the vector space of all such Lie super algebras (respectively, Lie algebras), where n = p + q = dim V and s = p - q is the signature. The description of P^+-(n,s) reduces to the construction of all so(V)-invariant bilinear forms on S and to the calculation of three Z_2-valued invariants for some of them.   This calculation is based on a simple explicit model of an irreducible Clifford module S for the Clifford algebra Cl_{p,q} of arbitrary signature (p,q). As a result of the classification, we obtain the numbers L^+-(n,s) = \dim P^+-(n,s) of independent Lie super algebras and algebras, which take values 0,1,2,3,4 or 6. Due to Bott periodicity, L^+-(n,s) may be considered as periodic functions with period 8 in each argument. They are invariant under the group Gamma generated by the four reflections with respect to the axes n=-2, n=2, s-1 = -2 and s-1 = 2. Moreover, the reflection (n,s) -> (-n,s) with respect to the axis s=0 interchanges L^+ and L^- : L^+(-n,s) = L^-(n,s).
