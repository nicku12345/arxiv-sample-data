Iwahori-Hecke algebras for the infinite series of complex reflection groups G(r,p,n) were constructed recently in the work of Ariki and Koike, Brou\'e and Malle, and Ariki. In this paper we give Murnaghan-Nakayama type formulas for computing the irreducible characters of these algebras. Our method is a generalization of that in our earlier paper in which we derived Murnaghan-Nakayama rules for the characters of the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of the classical Weyl groups. In both papers we have been motivated by C. Greene, who gave a new derivation of the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula for irreducible symmetric group characters by summing diagonal matrix entries in Young's seminormal representations. We use the analogous representations of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of G(r,p,n) given by Ariki and Koike.
