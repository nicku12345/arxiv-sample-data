The purpose of this paper is to describe a general procedure for computing analogues of Young's seminormal representations of the symmetric groups. The method is to generalize the Jucys-Murphy elements in the group algebras of the symmetric groups to arbitrary Weyl groups and Iwahori-Hecke algebras. The combinatorics of these elements allows one to compute irreducible representations explicitly and often very easily. In this paper we do these computations for Weyl groups and Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types A_n, B_n, D_n, G_2. Although these computations are in reach for types F_4, E_6, and E_7, we shall, in view of the length of the current paper, postpone this to another work.
