This paper is concerned with representations of split orthogonal and quasi-split unitary groups over a nonarchimedean local field which are not generic, but which support a unique model of a different kind, the generalized Bessel model. The properties of the Bessel models under induction are studied, and an analogue of Rodier's theorem concerning the induction of Whittaker models is proved for Bessel models which are minimal in a suitable sense. The holomorphicity in the induction parameter of the Bessel functional is established. Last, local coefficients are defined for each irreducible supercuspidal representation which carries a Bessel functional and also for a certain component of each representation parabolically induced from such a supercuspidal.
