We apply M. Ratner's theorem on closures of unipotent orbits to the study of three families of prehomogeneous vector spaces. As a result, we prove analogues of the Oppenheim Conjecture for simultaneous approximation by values of certain alternating bilinear forms in an even number of variables and certain alternating trilinear forms in six and seven variables.
