The statements of Main~Theorem~1.1 and Theorem~2.1 of the author's paper [\emph{Trans.\ Amer.\ Math.\ Soc.}\ {\bf 345} (1994) 577--594] should assume that \Gamma ~is discrete and G~is connected. (Cors.~1.3, 5.6, and~5.8 are affected similarly.) These restrictions can be removed if the conclusions of the results are weakened to allow for the possible existence of transitive, proper subgroups of~G. In this form, the results can be extended to the setting where G is a product of real and p-adic Lie groups.
