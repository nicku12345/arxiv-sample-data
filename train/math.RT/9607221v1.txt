Let \Gamma be a discrete subgroup of a simply connected, solvable Lie group~G, such that \Ad_G\Gamma has the same Zariski closure as \Ad G. If \alpha \colon \Gamma \to \GL_n(\real) is any finite-dimensional representation of~\Gamma ,we show that \alpha virtually extends to a continuous representation~\sigma  of~G. Furthermore, the image of~\sigma is contained in the Zariski closure of the image of~\alpha .   When \Gamma is not discrete, the same conclusions are true if we make the additional assumption that the closure of [\Gamma, \Gamma] is a finite-index subgroup of [G,G] \cap \Gamma (and \Gamma is closed and \alpha is continuous).
