Let \bold G be a reductive algebraic group defined over \Q, and let \Gamma be an arithmetic subgroup of \bold G(\Q). Let X be the symmetric space for \bold G(\R), and assume X is contractible. Then the cohomology (mod torsion) of the space X/\Gamma is the same as the cohomology of \Gamma. In turn, X/\Gamma will have the same cohomology as W/\Gamma, if W is a ``spine'' in X. This means that W (if it exists) is a deformation retract of X by a \Gamma-equivariant deformation retraction, that W/\Gamma is compact, and that \dim W equals the virtual cohomological dimension (vcd) of \Gamma. Then W can be given the structure of a cell complex on which \Gamma acts cellularly, and the cohomology of W/\Gamma can be found combinatorially.
