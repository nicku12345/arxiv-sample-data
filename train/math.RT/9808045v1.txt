In this article we initiate a systematic study of irreducible weight modules over direct limits of reductive Lie algebras, and in particular over the simple Lie algebras A(\infty), B(\infty), C(\infty) and D(\infty). Our main tool is the shadow method introduced recently in \cite{DMP}. The integrable irreducible modules are an important particular class and we give an explicit parametrization of the finite integrable modules which are analogues of finite-dimensional irreducible modules over reductive Lie algebras. We then introduce the more general class of pseudo highest weight modules. Our most general result is the description of the support of any irreducible weight module.
