We show that a set of monic polynomials in the free Lie superalgebra is a Gr\"obner-Shirshov basis for a Lie superalgebra if and only if it is a Gr\"obner-Shirshov basis for its universal enveloping algebra. We investigate the structure of Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases for Kac-Moody superalgebras and give explicit constructions of Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases for classical Lie superalgebras.
