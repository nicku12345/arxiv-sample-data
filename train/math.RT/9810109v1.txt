The description of irreducible finite dimensional representations of finite dimensional solvable Lie superalgebras over complex numbers given by V.~Kac is refined. In reality these representations are not just induced from a polarization but twisted, as infinite dimensional representations of solvable Lie algebras. Various cases of irreducibility (general and of type Q) are classified.
