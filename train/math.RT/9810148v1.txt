The symmetric group S_n possesses a nontrivial central extension, whose irreducible representations, different from the irreducible representations of S_n itself, coincide with the irreducible representations of a certain algebra A_n. Recently M.~Nazarov realized irreducible representations of A_n and Young symmetrizers by means of the Howe duality between the Lie superalgebra q(n) and the Hecke algebra H_n, the semidirect product of S_n with the Clifford algebra C_n on n indeterminates.   Here I construct one more analog of Young symmetrizers in H_n as well as the analogs of Specht modules for A_n and H_n.
