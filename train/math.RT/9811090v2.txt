Let A_k denote the twisted group algebra of the symmetric group S_k, whose representations correspond to the nonlinear projective representations of S_k. We establish a duality relation between A_k and a Lie superalgebra q(n), sometimes called the ``queer'' Lie superalgebra. This duality clarifies Schur's formula, in the sense that the Schur-Weyl duality clarifies Frobenius' formula.
