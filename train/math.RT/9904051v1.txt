We construct an explicit realization of a minimal representation of G, where G is the conformal group of a real Jordan algebra N. We characterize spherical vectors for these representation and prove that they are closely related to the Bessel K-function K_\tau (z). The resulting construction can be used to study tensor powers of the minimal representation and establish an extension of the Howe duality correspondence to some exceptional groups.
