We classify the finite dimensional indecomposable sl(m/n)-modules with at least a typical or singly atypical primitive weight. We do this classification not only for weight modules, but also for generalized weight modules. We obtain that such a generalized weight module is simply a module obtained by ``linking'' sub-quotient modules of generalized Kac-modules. By applying our results to sl(m/1), we have in fact completely classified all finite dimensional sl(m/1)-modules.
