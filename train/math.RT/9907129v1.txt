In this paper we prove theorems that describe how the representation theory of the affine Hecke algebra of type A and of related algebras such as the group algebra of the symmetric group are controlled by integrable highest weight representations of the characteristic zero affine Lie algebra \hat{sl}_l. In particular we parameterise the representations of these algebras by the nodes of the crystal graph, and give various Hecke theoretic descriptions of the edges.   As a consequence we find for each prime p a basis of the integrable representations of \hat{sl}_l which shares many of the remarkable properties, such as positivity, of the global crystal basis/canonical basis of Lusztig and Kashiwara. This {\it p-canonical basis} is the usual one when p = 0, and the crystal of the p-canonical basis is always the usual one.   The paper is self-contained, and our techniques are elementary (no perverse sheaves or algebraic geometry is invoked).
