Loop groups G as families of mappings of the complex manifold M into another complex manifold N preserving marked points s_0\in M and y_0\in N are investigated. Quasi-invariant measures \mu  on G relative to dense subgroups G' are constructed. These measures are used for the studying of irreducible representations of such groups.
