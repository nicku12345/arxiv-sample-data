Let H be a closed normal subgroup of a compact Lie group G such that G/H is connected. This paper provides a necessary and sufficient condition for every complex representation of H to be extendible to G, and also for every complex G-vector bundle over the homogeneous space G/H to be trivial. In particular, we show that the condition holds when the fundamental group of G/H is torsion free.
