A detailed study of solutions to the first order partial differential equation H(x,y,z_x,z_y)=0, with special emphasis on the eikonal equation z_x^2+z_y^2=h(x,y), is made near points where the equation becomes singular in the sense that dH=0, in which case the method of characteristics does not apply. The main results are that there is a strong lack of uniqueness of solutions near such points and that solutions can be less regular than both the function H and the initial data of the problem, but that this loss of regularity only occurs along a pair of curves through the singular point. The main tools are symplectic geometry and the Sternberg normal form for Hamiltonian vector fields.
