In the present paper we study the variation of the dimensions h_k of spaces of symplectically harmonic cohomology classes (in the sense of Brylinski) on closed symplectic manifolds. We give a description of such variation for all 6-dimensional nilmanifolds equipped with symplectic forms. In particular, it turns out that certain 6-dimensional nilmanifolds possess families of homogeneous symplectic forms \omega_t for which numbers h_k(M,\omega_t) vary with respect to t. This gives an affirmative answer to a question raised by Boris Khesin and Dusa McDuff. Our result is in contrast with the case of 4-dimensional nilmanifolds which do not admit such variations by a remark of Dong Yan.
