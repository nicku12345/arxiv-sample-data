Let X be a compact manifold with a smooth action of a compact connected Lie group G. Let L\to X be a complex line bundle. Using the Cartan complex for equivariant cohomology, we give a new proof of a theorem of Hattori and Yoshida which says that the action of G lifts to L if and only if the first Chern class c\sb 1(L) of L can be lifted to an integral equivariant cohomology class in H\sp 2\sb G(X;\ZZ), and that the different lifts of the action are classified by the lifts of c\sb 1(L) to H\sp 2\sb G(X;\ZZ). As a corollary of our method of proof, we prove that, if the action is Hamiltonian and \nabla is a connection on L which is unitary for some metric on L and whose curvature is G-invariant, then there is a lift of the action to a certain power L\sp d (where d is independent of L) which leaves fixed the induced metric on L^d and the connection \nabla\sp{\otimes d}. This generalises to symplectic geometry a well known result in Geometric Invariant Theory.
