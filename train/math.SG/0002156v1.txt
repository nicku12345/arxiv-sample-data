We prove that each point in an almost-complex surface has a basis of complete hyperbolic neighborhoods. The problem is local, and therefore we can consider the case when our surface is {\bf R^4} with an arbitrary almost-complex structure J of class C^{1.\alpha}. Let C be a non-singular J-complex curve passing through the origin. Our result cah be stated as follows: There exists a basis \{U_j\} of neighborhoods of zero in {\bf R^4}, such that (U_j,J) are complete hyperbolic in the sence of Kobayashi, moreover (U_j\setminus C,J) are complete hyperbolic as well.   The fact that this result remains true for any almost-complex structure is somewhat suprising. Really, given any germ of a non-singular real surface C\ni 0 in {\bf R^4}, one can easily construct an almost-complex structure J in a neighborhood of zero, such that C becomes a J-complex curve.   Typical corollary is the following:   Let {\cal M}_{\omega, 5l} be the Banach manifold consisting of pairs (J,\{D_j\}_{j=1}^5), where J is any almost-complex structure on {\bf CP^2} tamed by the Fubini-Studi form \omega and \{D_j\}_{j=1}^5 the union of five J-complex lines in {\bf CP^2} in general position. The set {\cal H}_{\omega, 5l} consisting of (J, \{D_j\}_{j=1}^5) with Y=({\bf CP^2}\setminus \bigcup_{j=1}^5 D_j,J) hyperbolically imbedded into ({\bf CP^2}, J) is an open nonempty subset of {\cal M}{\omega, 5l}.
