The main theorem of this paper asserts that the inclusion of the space of projective Lagrangian planes into the space of Lagrangian submanifolds of complex projective space induces an injective homomorphism of fundamental groups. We introduce three invariants of exact loops of Lagrangian submanifolds that are modelled on invariants introduced by Polterovich for loops of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms. One of these is the minimal Hofer length in a given Hamiltonian isotopy class. We determine the exact values of these invariants for loops of projective Lagrangian planes. The proof uses the Gromov invariants of an associated symplectic fibration over the 2-disc with a Lagrangian subbundle over the boundary.
