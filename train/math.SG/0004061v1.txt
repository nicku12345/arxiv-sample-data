We extend the famous convexity theorem of Atiyah, Guillemin and Sternberg to the case of non-Hamiltonian actions. We show that the image of a generalized momentum map is a bounded polytope times a vector space. We prove that this picture is stable for small perturbations of the symplectic form. We also observe that an n-dimensional torus symplectic action on a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold, with fixed point, is Hamiltonian. We finally prove that an extension of Kirwan's convexity theorem (for compact group actions) is also true.
