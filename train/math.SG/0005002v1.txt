We show that for a large class of contact 3-manifolds the groups of Vassiliev invariants of Legendrian and of framed knots are canonically isomorphic. As a corollary, we obtain that the group of finite order Arnold's J^+-type invariants of wave fronts on a surface F is isomorphic to the group of Vassiliev invariants of framed knots in the spherical cotangent bundle ST^*F of F.   On the other hand we construct the first examples of contact manifolds for which Vassiliev invariants of Legendrian knots can distinguish Legendrian knots that realize isotopic framed knots and are homotopic as Legendrian immersions.
