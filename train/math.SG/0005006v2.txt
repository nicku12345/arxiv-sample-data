We provide a general study for triangular dynamical r-matrices using Poisson geometry. We show that a triangular dynamical r-matrix always gives rise to a regular Poisson manifold. Using the Fedosov method, we prove that non-degenerate (i.e., the corresponding Poisson manifolds are symplectic) triangular dynamical r-matrices (over  \frakh^*  and valued in \wedge^{2}\frakg) are quantizable, and the quantization is classified by the relative Lie algebra cohomology H^{2}(\frakg, \frakh)[[\hbar ]]. We also generalize this quantization method to splittable triangular dynamical r-matrices, which include all the known examples of triangular dynamical r-matrices. Finally, we arrive a conjecture that the quantization for an arbitrary triangular dynamical r-matrix is classified by the formal neighbourhood of this r-matrix in the modular space of triangular dynamical r-matrices. The dynamical r-matrix cohomology is introduced as a tool to understand such a modular space.
