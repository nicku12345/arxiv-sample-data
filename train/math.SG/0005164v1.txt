We study special Lagrangian cones in \C^n with isolated singularities. Our main result constructs an infinite family of special Lagrangian cones in \C^3 each of which has a toroidal link. We obtain a detailed geometric description of these tori. We prove a regularity result for special Lagrangian cones in \C^3 with a spherical link -- any such cone must be a plane. We also construct a one-parameter family of asymptotically conical special Lagrangian submanifolds from any special Lagrangian cone.
