Let X be a smooth projective variety. Using modified psi classes on the stack of genus zero stable maps to X, a new associative quantum product is constructed on the cohomology space of X. When X is a homogeneous variety, this structure encodes the characteristic numbers of rational curves in X, and specialises to the usual quantum product upon resetting the parameters corresponding to the modified psi classes. For X = P^2, the product is equivalent to that of the contact cohomology of Ernstrom-Kennedy.
