We consider invariant symplectic connections \nabla on homogeneous symplectic manifolds (M,\omega) with curvature of Ricci type. Such connections are solutions of a variational problem studied by Bourgeois and Cahen, and provide an integrable almost complex structure on the bundle of almost complex structures compatible with the symplectic structure. If M is compact with finite fundamental group then (M,\omega) is symplectomorphic to \P_n(\C) with a multiple of its K\"ahler form and \nabla is affinely equivalent to the Levi-Civita connection.
