We construct symplectic submanifolds of symplectic manifolds with contact border. The boundary of such submanifolds is shown to be a contact submanifold of the contact border. We also give a topological characterization of the constructed submanifolds by means of a ``relative Lefschetz hyperplane Theorem''. We sketch some of the applications of the results.
