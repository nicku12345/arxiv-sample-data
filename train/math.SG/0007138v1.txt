We study Jacobi structures on the dual bundle A^\ast to a vector bundle A such that the Jacobi bracket of linear functions is again linear and the Jacobi bracket of a linear function and the constant function 1 is a basic function. We prove that a Lie algebroid structure on A and a 1-cocycle \phi \in \Gamma (A^\ast) induce a Jacobi structure on A^\ast satisfying the above conditions. Moreover, we show that this correspondence is a bijection. Finally, we discuss some examples and applications.
