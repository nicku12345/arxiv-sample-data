Let G be a torus of dimension n > 1 and M a compact Hamiltonian G-manifold with M^G finite. A circle, S^1, in G is generic if M^G = M^{S^1}. For such a circle the moment map associated with its action on M is a perfect Morse function. Let \{ W_p^+ ; p \in M^G\} be the Morse-Whitney stratification of M associated with this function, and let \tau_p^+ be the equivariant Thom class dual to W_p^+. These classes form a basis of H_G^*(M) as a module over \SS(\fg^*) and, in particular, \tau_p^+ \tau_q^+ = \sum c_{pq}^r \tau_r^+ with c_{pq}^r \in \SS(\fg^*). For manifolds of GKM type we obtain a combinatorial description of these \tau_p^+'s and, from this description, a combinatorial formula for c_{pq}^r.
