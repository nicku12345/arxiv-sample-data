On the space {\cal L}, of loops in the group of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of a symplectic quantizable manifold, we define a closed {\bf Z}-valued 1-form \Omega. If \Omega vanishes, the prequantization map can be extended to a group representation. On {\cal L} one can define an action integral as an {\bf R}/{\bf Z}-valued function, and the cohomology class [\Omega] is the obstruction to the lifting of that action integral to an {\bf R}-valued function. The form \Omega also defines a natural grading on \pi_1({\cal L}).
