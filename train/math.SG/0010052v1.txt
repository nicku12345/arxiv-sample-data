The main theorem of this paper is a result of estimated transversality with respect to stratifications of jet spaces in the approximately holomorphic category over an almost-complex manifold. The notion of asymptotic ampleness of complex vector bundles over an almost-complex manifold is also discussed, as well as applications to the construction of maps with generic singularities from compact symplectic manifolds to projective spaces.
