Lecomte and Ovsienko constructed SL_{n+1}(R)-equivariant quantization maps Q_\lambda for symbols of differential operators on \lambda-densities on \RP^n.   We derive some formulas for the associated graded equivariant star products star_\lambda on the symbol algebra Pol(T*\RP^n). These give some measure of the failure of locality.   Our main result expresses (for n odd) the coefficients C_p of star_\lambda when \lambda=\half in terms of some new SL_{n+1}(C)-invariant algebraic bidifferential operators Z_p on T*\CP^n and the operators (E+\frac{n}{2}\pm s)^{-1} where E is the fiberwise Euler vector field and s\in\{1,2,...,[\frac{p}{2}]\}.
