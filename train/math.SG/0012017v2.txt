We show that the cone associated with a moment map for an action of a torus on a contact compact connected manifold is a convex polyhedral cone and that the moment map has connected fibers provided the dimension of the torus is bigger than 2 and that no orbit is tangent to the contact distribution. This may be considered as a version of the Atiyah - Guillemin - Sternberg convexity theorem for torus actions on symplectic cones and as a direct generalization of the convexity theorem of Banyaga and Molino for completely integrable torus actions on contact manifolds.
