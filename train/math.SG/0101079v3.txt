In this paper we shall give formulas for the pairings of intersection cohomology classes of complementary dimensions in the intersection cohomology of geometric invariant theoretic quotients for which semistability is not necessarily the same as stability (although we make some weaker assumptions on the action). We also give formulas for intersection pairings on resolutions of singularities (or more precisely partial resolutions, since orbifold singularities are allowed) of the quotients.
