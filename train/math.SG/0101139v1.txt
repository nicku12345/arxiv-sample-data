Symplectic manifolds which are homogeneous spaces of Poisson-Lie groups are studied in this paper. We show that these spaces are, under certain assumptions, covering spaces of dressing orbits of the Poisson-Lie groups which act on them. The effect of the Poisson induction procedure on such spaces is also examined, thus leading to an interesting generalization of the notion of homogeneous space. Some examples of homogeneous spaces of Poisson-Lie groups are discussed in the light of the previous results.
