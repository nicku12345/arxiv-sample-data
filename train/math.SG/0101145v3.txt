We provide a translation between Chekanov's combinatorial theory for invariants of Legendrian knots in the standard contact R^3 and a relative version of Eliashberg and Hofer's Contact Homology. We use this translation to transport the idea of ``coherent orientations'' from the Contact Homology world to Chekanov's combinatorial setting. As a result, we obtain a lifting of Chekanov's differential graded algebra invariant to an algebra over Z[t,t^{-1}] with a full Z grading.
