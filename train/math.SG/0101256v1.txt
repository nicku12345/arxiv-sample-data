We show by studying the symplectic geometry of the extended moduli space that the intersection cohomology of the representation space Hom(\pi_1(\Sigma),G)/G for a simply connected compact Lie group G is naturally embedded into the G equivariant cohomology of Hom(\pi_1(\Sigma),G) where \Sigma is a closed Riemann surface. This enables us to compute the intersection cohomology as a graded vector space with intersection pairing, in terms of the equivariant cohomology ring. The case where G=SU(2) -- the moduli space of rank 2 holomorphic vector bundles of even degree -- is discussed in detail.
