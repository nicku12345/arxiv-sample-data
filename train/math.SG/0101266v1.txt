Let M be an n-dimensional manifold, V the space of a representation \rho: GL(n)\longrightarrow GL(V). Locally, let T(V) be the space of sections of the tensor bundle with fiber V over a sufficiently small open set U\subset M, in other words, T(V) is the space of tensor fields of type V on M on which the group \Diff (M) of diffeomorphisms of M naturally acts. Elsewhere, the author classified the \Diff (M)-invariant differential operators D: T(V_{1})\otimes T(V_{2})\longrightarrow T(V_{3}) for irreducible fibers with lowest weight. Here the result is generalized to bilinear operators invariant with respect to the group \Diff_{\omega}(M) of symplectomorphisms of the symplectic manifold (M, \omega). We classify all first order invariant operators; the list of other operators is conjectural. Among the new operators we mention a 2nd order one which determins an ``algebra'' structure on the space of metrics (symmetric forms) on M.
