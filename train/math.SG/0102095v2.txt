We study the coherent orientations of the moduli spaces of holomorphic curves in Symplectic Field Theory, generalizing a construction due to Floer and Hofer. In particular we examine their behavior at multiple closed Reeb orbits under change of the asymptotic direction. The orientations are determined by a certain choice of orientation at each closed Reeb orbit, that is similar to the orientation of the unstable tangent spaces of critical points in finite--dimensional Morse theory.
