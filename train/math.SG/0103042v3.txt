The purpose of this note is to define tri-moment maps for certain manifolds that carry closed non-degenerate 4-forms and an Sp(1)^n-action. Examples include quaternionic vector spaces and flag manifolds. We show how this map can be used ro reduce such manifolds to the ones with fewer symmetries. The images of such maps for quaternionic flag manifolds, which are defined using the Dieudonn\'e determinant, resemble the polytopes from the complex case.
