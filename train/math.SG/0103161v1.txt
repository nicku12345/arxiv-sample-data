Let {\cal O} be the orbit of \eta\in{\frak g}^* under the coadjoint action of the compact Lie group G. We give two formulae for calculating the action integral along a closed Hamiltonian isotopy on {\cal O}. The first one expresses this action in terms of a particular character of the isotropy subgroup of \eta. In the second one is involved the character of an irreducible representation of G.
