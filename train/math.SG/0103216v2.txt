In this note we present a new definition of the 4-manifold admitting inequivalent symplectic structures constructed by McMullen-Taubes which leads to the identification of a new symplectic structure. We prove moreover that it is diffeomorphic to one of the link surgery manifolds introduced by Fintushel-Stern.
