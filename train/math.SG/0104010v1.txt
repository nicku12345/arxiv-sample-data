In this paper we summarize our recent work in the construction of Lagrangian torus fibrations for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties and the symplectic Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture, together with some new development. It is submittded to the Proceedings of the Conference in Symplectic Geometry and Mirror Symmetry held in KIAS, Seoul, Korea. The paper was finished in Jan. 2001, with revisions and added reference.
