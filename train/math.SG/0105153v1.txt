We study the classical action functional \SMC_V on the free loop space of a closed, finite dimensional Riemannian manifold M and the symplectic action \AMC_V on the free loop space of its cotangent bundle. The critical points of both functionals can be identified with the set of perturbed closed geodesics in M. The potential V\in C^\infty(M\times S^1,\R) serves as perturbation and we show that both functionals are Morse for generic V. In this case we prove that the Morse index of a critical point x of \SMC_V equals minus its Conley-Zehnder index when viewed as a critical point of \AMC_V and if x^*TM \to S^1 is trivial. Otherwise a correction term +1 appears.
