The long exact sequence describes how the Floer cohomology of two Lagrangian submanifolds changes if one of them is modified by applying a Dehn twist. We give a proof in the simplest case (no bubbling). The paper contains a certain amount of material that may be of interest independently of the exact sequence: in particular, chapter 1 covers "symplectic Picard-Lefschetz theory" in some detail, and chapter 2 contains a generalization of the usual TQFT setup for Floer cohomology.
