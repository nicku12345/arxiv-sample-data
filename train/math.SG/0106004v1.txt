This paper proposes a new way to quantize classical mechanical systems. Here we use ALAG - programme to construct moduli space of half weighted Bohr - Sommerfeld lagrangian cycles of fixed volume which is our quantum phase space. "Dynamical correspondence" principle makes possible to prove that this ALAG - quantization satisfies the Dirac correspondence principle. This construction relates two known quantizations using complex and real polarizations respectively.
