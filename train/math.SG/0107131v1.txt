We show that for a Hamiltonian action of a compact torus G on a compact, connected symplectic manifold M, the G-equivariant cohomology is determined by the residual S^1 action on the submanifolds of M fixed by codimension-1 tori. This theorem allows us to compute the equivariant cohomology of certain manifolds, which have pieces that are four-dimensional or smaller. We give several examples of the computations that this allows.
