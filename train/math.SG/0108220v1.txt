In this short article we give a criterion whether a given minimal symplectic 4-manifold with b_{2}^{+}=1 having a torsion-free canonical class is rational or ruled. As a corollary, we confirm that most of homotopy elliptic surfaces E(1}_{K}, K is a fibered knot in S^3, constructed by R. Fintushel and R. Stern are minimal symplectic 4-manifolds with b_{2}^{+}=1 which do not admit a complex structure.
