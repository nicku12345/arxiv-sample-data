The aim of this article is to introduce invariants of oriented, smooth, closed four-manifolds, built using the Floer homology theories defined in two earlier papers (math.SG/0101206 and math.SG/0105202).   This four-dimensional theory also endows the corresponding three-dimensional theories with additional structure: an absolute grading of certain of its Floer homology groups. The cornerstone of these constructions is the study of holomorphic disks in the symmetric products of Riemann surfaces.
