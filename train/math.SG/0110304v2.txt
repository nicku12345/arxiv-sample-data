Poisson structures vanishing linearly on a set of smooth closed disjoint curves are generic in the set of all Poisson structures on a compact connected oriented surface. We construct a complete set of invariants classifying these structures up to an orientation-preserving Poisson isomorphism. We show that there is a set of non-trivial infinitesimal deformations which generate the second Poisson cohomology and such that each of the deformations changes exactly one of the classifying invariants. As an example, we consider Poisson structures on the sphere which vanish linearly on a set of smooth closed disjoint curves.
