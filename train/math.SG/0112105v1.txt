We examine the Legendrian analogue of the topological satellite construction for knots, and deduce some results for specific Legendrian knots and links in standard contact three-space and the solid torus. In particular, we show that the Chekanov-Eliashberg contact homology invariants of Legendrian Whitehead doubles of stabilized knots contain no nonclassical information.
