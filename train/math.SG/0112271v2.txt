We show that an oriented elliptic 3-manifold admits a universally tight positive contact structure iff the corresponding group of deck transformations on S^3 preserves a standard contact structure pointwise.   We also relate univerally tight contact structures on 3-manifolds covered by S^3 to the exceptional isomorphism SO(4)=(SU(2)\times SU(2))/{\pm 1}.   The main tool used is equivariant framings of 3-manifolds.
