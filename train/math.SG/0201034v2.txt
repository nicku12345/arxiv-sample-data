In this paper we show that the Seiberg--Witten invariant is zero for all smooth 4--manifolds with b_+{>}1 which admit circle actions that have at least one fixed point. Furthermore, we show that all symplectic 4--manifolds which admit circle actions with fixed points are rational or ruled, and thus admit a symplectic circle action.
