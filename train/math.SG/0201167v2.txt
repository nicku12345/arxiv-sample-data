We consider analytic curves \nabla^t of symplectic connections of Ricci type on the torus T^{2n} with \nabla^0 the standard connection. We show, by a recursion argument, that if \nabla^t is a formal curve of such connections then there exists a formal curve of symplectomorphisms \psi_t such that \psi_t\cdot\nabla^t is a formal curve of flat invariant symplectic connections and so \nabla^t is flat for all t. Applying this result to the Taylor series of the analytic curve, it means that analytic curves of symplectic connections of Ricci type starting at \nabla^0 are also flat.   The group G of symplectomorphisms of the torus (T^{2n},\omega) acts on the space \E of symplectic connections which are of Ricci type. As a preliminary to studying the moduli space \E/G we study the moduli of formal curves of connections under the action of formal curves of symplectomorphisms.
