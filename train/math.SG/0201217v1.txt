The purpose of this paper is to give an application of the gluing theorem for special Lagrangian submanifolds of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold. We proved a gluing theorem before to smooth a codimension-two singularity of a particular special Lagrangian submanifold. In this paper we will show that this theorem can be applied to more general cases where different special Lagrangians are intersecting and gives a way of constructing new special Lagrangian submanifolds. As an example we will show that a smooth special Lagrangian submanifold can be obtained from five copies of RP^3 intersecting pairwise in a quintic.
