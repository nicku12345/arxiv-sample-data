Some functorial properties are studied for the H\"{o}rmander classes defined for symplectic bundles. The behaviour of the Chern first form on a Lagrangian submanifold in an almost Hermitian manifold is also studied, and Fomenko's conjecture about the behaviour of a Maslov class on minimal Lagrangian submanifolds is considered.
