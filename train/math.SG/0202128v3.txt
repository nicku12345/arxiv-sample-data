The paper is devoted to the comparison of the Fukaya category (it is responcible for the A-side of mirror symmetry) with the category of holonomic modules over the quantized algebra of functions on the same symplectic manifold. We conjecture that these categories become A_{\infty}-equivalent after a twist by a kind of integral transformation.
