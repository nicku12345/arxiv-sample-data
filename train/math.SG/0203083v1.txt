On a symplectic manifold M, the quantum product defines a complex, one parameter family of flat connections called the A-model or Dubrovin connections. Let \hbar denote the parameter. Associated to them is the quantum \mathcal{D} - module {\mathcal{D}}/I over the Heisenberg algebra of first order differential operators on a complex torus. An element of I gives a relation in the quantum cohomology of M by taking the limit as \hbar\to 0. Givental (HomGeom), discovered that there should be a structure of a \mathcal{D} - module on the (as yet not rigorously defined) {S^1} equivariant Floer cohomology of the loop space of M and conjectured that the two modules should be equal. Based on that, we formulate a conjecture about how to compute the quantum cohomology \mathcal{D} - module in terms of Morse theoretic data for the symplectic action functional. The conjecture is proven in the case of toric manifolds with \int_d{c_1}> 0 for all nonzero classes d of rational curves in M.
