We compute the Floer homology of mapping classes which do not have any pseudo-Anosov components in the sense of Thurston's theory of surface diffeomorphisms. The formula for the Floer homology is obtained from a topological separation of fixed points and a separation mechanism for Floer connecting orbits. As examples, we consider the geometric monodromy of isolated plane curve singularities.
