Engel structures on M x S^1 and M x I are studied in this paper, where M is a 3-dimensional manifold. We suppose that these structures have characteristic line fields parallel to the fibres, S^1 or I. It is proved that they are characterized by contact structures on the cross section M, the twisting numbers, and Legendrian foliations on both ends M x dI in the case of M x I.
