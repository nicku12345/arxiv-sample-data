A holonomic knot is a knot in 3-space which arises as the 2-jet extension of a smooth function on the circle. A holonomic knot associated to a generic function is naturally framed by the blackboard framing of the knot diagram associated to the 1-jet extension of the function. There are two classical invariants of framed knot diagrams: the Whitney index (rotation number) W and the self linking number S. For a framed holonomic knot we show that W is bounded above by the negative of the braid index of the knot, and that the sum of W and |S| is bounded by the negative of the Euler characteristic of any Seifert surface of the knot. The invariant S restricted to framed holonomic knots with W=m, is proved to split into n, where n is the largest natural number with 2n < |m|+1, integer invariants. Using this, the framed holonomic isotopy classification of framed holonomic knots is shown to be more refined than the regular isotopy classification of their diagrams.
