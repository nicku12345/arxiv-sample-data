It is a well known fact that every embedded symplectic surface \Sigma in a symplectic 4-manifold (X^4,\omega) can be made J-holomorphic for some almost-complex structure J compatible with \omega. In this paper we investigate when such a J can be chosen from a generic set of almost-complex structures. As an application we give examples of smooth and non-empty Seiberg-Witten and Gromov-Witten moduli spaces whose associated invariants are zero.
