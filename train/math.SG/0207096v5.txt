We study in this paper the rational homotopy type of the space of symplectic embeddings of the standard ball B^4(c) \subset \R^4 into 4-dimensional rational symplectic manifolds. We compute the rational homotopy groups of that space when the 4-manifold has the form M_{\lambda}= (S^2 \times S^2, \mu \omega_0 \oplus \omega_0) where \omega_0 is the area form on the sphere with total area 1 and \mu belongs to the interval [1,2]. We show that, when \mu is 1, this space retracts to the space of symplectic frames, for any value of c. However, for any given 1 < \mu < 2, the rational homotopy type of that space changes as c crosses the critical parameter c_{crit} = \mu - 1, which is the difference of areas between the two S^2 factors. We prove moreover that the full homotopy type of that space changes only at that value, i.e the restriction map between these spaces is a homotopy equivalence as long as these values of c remain either below or above that critical value.
