If a finite group acts holomorphically on a pair (X,L), where X is a complex projective manifold and L a line bundle on it, for every k the space of holomorphic global section of the k-th power of L splits equivariantly according to the irreducible representations of G. We consider the asymptotic growth of these summands, under various positivity conditions on L. The methods apply also to the context of almost complex quantization.
