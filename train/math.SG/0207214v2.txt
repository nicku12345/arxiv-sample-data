This is a sequel to the paper [Oh5] (or ArXiv:math.SG/0206092). The main purpose of the paper is to give the proof of an existence theorem, with energy bounds, of certain pseudo-holomorphic sections of the mapping cylinder that is needed for the proof of nondegeneracy of the homological invariant pseudo-norm which the author has constructed on general symplectic manifolds [Oh4,5]. The existence theorem is also the crux of the author's recent proof of an optimal energy-capacity inequality given in [Oh5]. In this paper, we prove a more general existence result than needed in that we study Floer's perturbed Cauchy-Riemann equations with discontinous Hamiltonian perturbation terms and prove an existence theorem of certain piecewise smooth finite energy solutions of the equation. The proof relies on a careful study of the product structure in the chain level Floer homology theory and a singular degeneration (``adiabatic degeneration'') of Floer's perturbed Cauchy-Riemann equation. In the course of the proof, we also derive certain general energy identity of pseudo-holomorphic sections of the Hamiltonian fibration.
