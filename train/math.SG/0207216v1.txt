Gromov's nonsqueezing theorem, aka the property of the symplectic camel, leads to a very simple semiclassical quantiuzation scheme by imposing that the only "physically admissible" semiclassical phase space states are those whose symplectic capacity (in a sense to be precised) is nh + (1/2)h where h is Planck's constant. We the construct semiclassical waveforms on Lagrangian submanifolds using the properties of the Leray-Maslov index, which allows us to define the argument of the square root of a de Rham form.
