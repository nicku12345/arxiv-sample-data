This paper is part of a larger program, the investigation of the Chord Problem in three dimensional contact geometry. The main tool will be pseudoholomorphic strips in the symplectisation of a three dimensional contact manifold with two totally real submanifolds L_0,L_1 as boundary conditions. The submanifolds L_0 and L_1 do not intersect transversally. The subject of this paper is to study the asymptotic behavior of such pseudoholomorphic strips.
