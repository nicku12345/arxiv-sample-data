We define a Floer-homology invariant for knots in an oriented three-manifold, closely related to the holomorphic disk Floer homologies for three-manifolds defined in an earlier paper. We set up basic properties of these invariants, including an Euler characteristic calculation, behaviour under connected sums. Then, we establish a relationship with HF^+ for surgeries along the knot. Applications include calculation of HF^+ of three-manifolds obtained by surgeries on some special knots in S^3, and also calculation of HF^+ for certain simple three-manifolds which fiber over the circle.
