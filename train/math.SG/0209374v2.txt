For any compact oriented manifold M, we show that that the top degree multi-vector fields transverse to the zero section of \wedge^{\text{top}}TM are classified, up to orientation preserving diffeomorphism, in terms of the topology of the arrangement of its zero locus and a finite number of numerical invariants. The group governing the infinitesimal deformations of such multi-vector fields is computed, and an explicit set of generators exhibited. For the spheres S^n, a correspondence between certain isotopy classes of multi-vector fields and classes of weighted signed trees is established.
