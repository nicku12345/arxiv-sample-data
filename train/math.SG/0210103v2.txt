A topological condition is given, characterizing which closed manifolds in dimensions < 8 (and conjecturally in general) admit symplectic structures. The condition is the existence of a certain fibration-like structure called a hyperpencil. A deformation class of hyperpencils on a manifold X of any even dimension is shown to determine an isotopy class of symplectic structures on X. This provides an inverse (at least in dimensions < 8) to Donaldson's program for constructing linear systems on symplectic manifolds. It follows that (at least in dimensions < 8) the set of deformation classes of hyperpencils canonically maps onto the set of isotopy classes of rational symplectic forms up to positive scale, topologically determining a dense subset of all symplectic forms up to an equivalence relation on hyperpencils. Other applications of the main techniques are presented, including the construction of symplectic structures on domains of locally holomorphic maps, and on high-dimensional Lefschetz pencils and other linear systems.
