The category of Banach Lie-Poisson spaces is introduced and studied. It is shown that the category of W*-algebras can be considered as one of its subcategories. Examples and applications of Banach Lie-Poisson spaces to quantization and integration of Hamiltonian systems are given. The relationship between classical and quantum reduction is discussed.
