If g is a quasitriangular Lie bialgebra, one can asks what is the geometrical meaning of its r-matrix. A first answer was given in a paper by Weinstein and Xu, using purely geometrical means: roughly, one has that the formal Poisson group F[[g^*]] is endowed with a "braiding", i.e. a distinguished operator on its tensor square which satisfy quasitriangularity conditions (in particular, it is a solution of the QYBE). Independently, the authors also found, by means of quantum groups, that F[[g^*]] has a braiding.   In this paper we compare these two approaches and their outcomes. First, we show that the two braidings obtained in the two processes do share several similar properties (in particular, the construction is functorial). Second, in the simplest case (G = SL_2) we prove that the two braidings do coincide. The question then rises of whether they are always the same: this problem is addressed and solved in math.QA/0207235, in a much broader context, in which unicity of braidings is proved.
