By a theorem of Banyaga the group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold P preserving a regular contact form \alpha is a central S^1 extension of the commutator of the group of symplectomorphisms of the base B = P/S^1. We show that if T is a Hamiltonian maximal torus in the group of symplectomorphism of B, then its preimage under the extension map is a maximal torus not only in the group \Diff(P, \alpha) of diffeomorphisms of P preserving \alpha but also in the much bigger group of contactomorphisms \Diff (P, \xi), the group of diffeomorphism of P preserving the contact distribution \xi = \ker \alpha. We use this (and the work of Hausmann, and Tolman on polygon spaces) to give examples of contact manifolds (P, \xi = \ker \alpha) with maximal tori of different dimensions in their group of contactomorphisms.
