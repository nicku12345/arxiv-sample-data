We study the asymptotics of almost holomorphic sections s \in H^0_J(M, \omega) of an ample line bundle L \to M over an almost complex symplectic manifold in the sense of Boutet de Monvel-Guillemin. Such sections are defined as the kernel of a complex which is analogous to the \bar{\partial} complex for a positive line bundle over a complex manifold. Our main result is the scaling limit asymptotics of the Szego projectors \Pi_N of powers L^N. The Kodaira embedding theorem and Tian almost isometry theorem are almost immediate consequences of the scaling limit. We also relate such almost holomorphic sections to the asymptotically holomorphic sections in the sense of Donaldson and Auroux.
