We define a Gaussian measure on the space H^0_J(M, L^N) of almost holomorphic sections of powers of an ample line bundle L over a symplectic manifold (M, \omega), and calculate the joint probability densities of sections taking prescribed values and covariant derivatives at a finite number of points. We prove that they have a universal scaling limit as N \to \infty. This result completes our proof (with P. Bleher) that correlations between zeros of sections in the almost-holomorphic setting have the same universal scaling limit as in the complex case (see Universality and scaling of zeros on symplectic manifolds, Random matrix models and their applications, 31--69, Math. Sci. Res. Inst. Publ., 40)
