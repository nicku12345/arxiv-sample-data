This article describes various moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves on the symplectization of a particular overtwisted contact structure on S^1 x S^2. This contact structure appears when one considers a closed self dual form on a 4-manifold as a symplectic form on the complement of its zero locus. The article is focussed mainly on disks, cylinders and three-holed spheres, but it also supplies groundwork for a description of moduli spaces of curves with more punctures and non-zero genus.
