We prove the following result, conjectured by Alan Weinstein: every smooth proper Lie groupoid near a fixed point is locally linearizable, i.e. it is locally isomorphic to the associated groupoid of a linear action of a compact Lie group. In combination with a slice theorem of Weinstein, our result implies the smooth linearizability of a proper Lie groupoid in the neighborhood of an orbit under a mild condition.
