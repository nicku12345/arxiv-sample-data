The purpose of this paper is to exhibit a natural construction between complex geometry and symplectic geometry following the idea of mirror symmetry. Suppose we are given a family of pairs of 2-dimensional K\"ahler tori and stable holomorphic vector bundles on them (\hat M_{\ep}, E_{\ep}), \ep \in (0, 1], and each has structure of a Lagrangian torus fibration \pi:\hat M_{\ep} \to B whose fibers are of diameter O(\ep), and let A_{\ep} be a family of hermitian Yang-Mills(HYM) connections on E_{\ep}. As \ep goes to zero, A_{\ep} will, modulo possible bubbles, converge to a connection which is flat on each fiber. Since each fiber is a torus, limit connection will determine elements of the dual torus, which are points of the fiber of the mirror M_1. These points gather to make up (special) Lagrangian variety.
