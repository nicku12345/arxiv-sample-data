Let M be a closed symplectic manifold and suppose M\to P\to B is a Hamiltonian fibration. Lalonde and McDuff raised the question whether one always has H^*(P;\mathbb Q)=H^*(M;\mathbb Q)\otimes H^*(B;\mathbb Q) as vector spaces. This is known as the c--splitting conjecture. They showed, that this indeed holds whenever the base is a sphere. Using their theorem we will prove the c--splitting conjecture for arbitrary base B and fibers M which satisfy a weakening of the Hard Lefschetz condition.
