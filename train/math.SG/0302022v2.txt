Suppose that two compact manifolds X, X' are connected by a sequence of Mukai flops. In this paper, we construct a ring isomorphism between cohomology ring of X and X'. Using the local mirror symmetry technique, we prove that the quantum corrected products on X, X' are the ordinary intersection products. Furthermore, X, X' have isomorphic Ruan cohomology. i.e. we proved the cohomological minimal model conjecture proposed by Ruan.
