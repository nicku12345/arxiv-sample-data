We introduce and develop a language of semigroups over the braid groups for a study of braid monodromy factorizations (bmf's) of plane algebraic curves and other related objects. As an application we give a new proof of Orevkov's theorem on realization of a bmf over a disc by algebraic curves and show that the complexity of such a realization can not be bounded in terms of the types of the factors of the bmf. Besides, we prove that the type of a bmf is distinguishing Hurwitz curves with singularities of inseparable types up to H-isotopy and J-holomorphic cuspidal curves in \C P^2 up to symplectic isotopy.
