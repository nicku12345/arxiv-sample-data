Let M be a compact manifold with a Hamiltonian T action and moment map Phi. The restriction map in equivariant cohomology from M to a level set Phi^{-1}(p) is a surjection, and we denote the kernel by I_p. When T has isolated fixed points, we show that I_p distinguishes the chambers of the moment polytope for M. In particular, counting the number of distinct ideals I_p as p varies over different chambers is equivalent to counting the number of chambers.
