We consider an integrable Hamiltonian system with n-degrees of freedom whose first integrals are invariant under the symplectic action of a compact Lie group G. We prove that the singular Lagrangian foliation associated to this Hamiltonian system is symplectically equivalent, in a G-equivariant way, to the linearized foliation in a neighborhood of a compact singular non-degenerate orbit. We also show that the non-degeneracy condition is not equivalent to the non-resonance condition for smooth systems.
