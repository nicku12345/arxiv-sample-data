In an earlier paper, we introduced a collection of graded Abelian groups \HFKa(Y,K) associated to knots in a three-manifold. The aim of the present paper is to investigate these groups for several specific families of knots, including the Kinoshita-Terasaka knots and their ``Conway mutants''. These results show that \HFKa contains more information than the Alexander polynomial and the signature of these knots; and they also illustrate the fact that \HFKa detects mutation. We also calculate \HFKa for certain pretzel knots, and knots with small crossing number (n\leq 9). Our calculations prove that many of the knots considered here admit no Seifert fibered surgeries.
