Let G be a connected, compact, semisimple Lie group. It is known that for a compact closed orientable surface \Sigma of genus l >1, the order of the group H^2(\Sigma,\pi_1(G)) is equal to the number of connected components of the space Hom(\pi_1(\Sigma),G)/G which can also be identified with the moduli space of gauge equivalence classes of flat G-bundles over \Sigma.   We show that the same statement for a closed compact nonorientable surface which is homeomorphic to the connected sum of k copies of the real projective plane, where k\neq 1,2,4, can be easily derived from a result in A. Alekseev, A.Malkin and E. Meinrenken's recent work on Lie group valued moment maps.
