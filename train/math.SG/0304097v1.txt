In this paper we consider the Arnold conjecture on the Lagrangian intersections of some closed Lagrangian submanifold of a closed symplectic manifold with its image of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism. We prove that if the Hofer's symplectic energy of the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism is less than a topology number defined by the Lagrangian submanifold, then the Arnold conjecture is true in the degenerated (non-transversal) case.
