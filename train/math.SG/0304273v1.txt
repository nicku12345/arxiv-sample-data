We give examples of compact symplectic manifolds with disconnected contact type boundary in dimension 4n for any n\geq 1. The example is given by a subset of the tangent bundle of a compact quotient of the complex hyperbolic space endowed with the canonical symplectic form plus a generalized magnetic field and its boundary is given by two hypersurfaces of constant kinetic energy. In particular, when n=1, it is obtained by the tangent bundle of a surface of genus greater than 1 endowed with the canonical symplectic form plus the pullback of the K\"ahler form by the canonical projection.
