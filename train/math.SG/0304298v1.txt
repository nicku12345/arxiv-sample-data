Gromov-Witten invariants of a symplectic manifold are a count of holomorphic curves. We describe a formula expressing the GW invariants of a symplectic sum X# Y in terms of the relative GW invariants of X and Y. This formula has several applications to enumerative geometry. As one application, we obtain new relations in the cohomology ring of the moduli space of complex structures on a genus g Riemann surface with n marked points.
