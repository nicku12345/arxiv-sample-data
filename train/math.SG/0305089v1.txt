For a given manifold M we consider the non-linear Grassmann manifold Gr_n(M) of n-dimensional submanifolds in M. A closed (n+2)-form on M gives rise to a closed 2-form on Gr_n(M). If the original form was integral, the 2-form will be the curvature of a principal S^1-bundle over Gr_n(M). Using this S^1-bundle one obtains central extensions for certain groups of diffeomorphisms of M. We can realize Gr_{m-2}(M) as coadjoint orbits of the extended group of exact volume preserving diffeomorphisms and the symplectic Grassmannians SGr_{2k}(M) as coadjoint orbits in the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. We also generalize the vortex filament equation as a Hamiltonian equation on Gr_{m-2}(M).
