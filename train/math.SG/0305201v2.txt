For each member of an infinite family of homology classes in the K3-surface E(2), we construct infinitely many non-isotopic symplectic tori representing this homology class. This family has an infinite subset of primitive classes. We also explain how these tori can be non-isotopically embedded as homologous symplectic submanifolds in many other symplectic 4-manifolds including the elliptic surfaces E(n) for n>2.
