This paper is the last in a series of three papers which investigate pseudoholomorphic strips in the symplectisation of a three dimensional closed contact manifold with a mixed boundary condition. We will prove a compactness and an intersection result, and we will investigate the embedding properties of such pseudoholomorphic curves.
