In two previous papers, the two first-named authors introduced a notion of contact r-surgery along Legendrian knots in contact 3-manifolds. They also showed how (at least in principle) to convert any contact r-surgery into a sequence of contact plus or minus 1 surgeries, and used this to prove that any (closed) contact 3-manifold can be obtained from the standard contact structure on the 3-sphere by a sequence of such surgeries.   In the present paper, we give a shorter proof of that result and a more explicit algorithm for turning a contact r-surgery into plus or minus 1 surgeries. We use this to give explicit surgery diagrams for all contact structures on the 3-sphere and S^1\times S^2, as well as all overtwisted contact structures on arbitrary closed, orientable 3-manifolds. This amounts to a new proof of the Lutz-Martinet theorem that each homotopy class of 2-plane fields on such a manifold is represented by a contact structure.
