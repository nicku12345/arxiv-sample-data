We construct a Kaehler structure on the punctured cotangent bundle of the Cayley projective plane whose Kaehler form coincides with the natural symplectic form on the cotangent bundle and we show that the geodesic flow action is holomorphic and is expressed in a quite explicit form. We also give an embedding of the punctured cotangent bundle of the Cayley projective plane into the space of 8 times 8 complex matrices.
