We compute explicitly the equivariant Hirzebruch \chi_y-characteristic of an equivariant complex line bundle over a toric manifold and state a weighted version of the quantization commutes with reduction principle in symplectic geometry. Then, we give a weighted decomposition formula for any simple polytope in \R^n. This formula generalizes a polytope decomposition due to Lawrence [10] and Varchenko [14] and extends a previous weighted version obtained by Karshon, Sternberg and Weitsman [9].
