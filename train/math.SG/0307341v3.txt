Using contact surgery we define families of contact structures on certain Seifert fibered three-manifolds. We prove that all these contact structures are tight using contact Ozsath-Szabo invariants. We use these examples to show that, given a natural number n, there exists a Seifert fibered three-manifold carrying at least n pairwise non-isomorphic tight, not fillable contact structures.
