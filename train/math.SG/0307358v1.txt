We explicitly compute family GW invariants of elliptic surfaces for primitive classes. That involves establishing a TRR formula and a symplectic sum formula for elliptic surfaces and then determining the GW invariants using an argument from \cite{ip3}. In particular, as in \cite{bl1}, these calculations also confirm the well-known Yau-Zaslow Conjecture \cite{yz} for primitive classes in K3 surfaces.
