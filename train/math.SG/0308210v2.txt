In this paper the relations between the existence of Lagrangian fibration of Hyper-K\"{a}hler manifolds and the existence of the Large Radius Limit is established. It is proved that if the the rank of the second homology group of a Hyper-K\"{a}hler manifold N of complex dimension 2n\geq4 is at least 5, then there exists an unipotent element T in the mapping class group \Gamma (N) such that its action on the second cohomology group satisfies (T-id)^{2}\neq0 and (T-id)^{3}=0. A Theorem of Verbitsky implies that the symmetric power S^{n}(T) acts on H^{2n} and it satisfies (S^{n}% (T)-id)^{2n}\neq0 and (S^{n}(T)-id)^{2n+1}=0. This fact established the existence of Large Radius Limit for Hyper-K\"{a}hler manifolds for polarized algebraic Hyper-K\"{a}hler manifolds. Using the theory of vanishing cycles it is proved that if a Hyper-K\"{a}hler manifold admits a Lagrangian fibration then the rank of the second homology group is greater than or equal to five. It is also proved that the fibre of any Lagrangian fibration of a Hyper-K\"{a}hler manifold is homological to a vanishing invariant 2n cycle of a maximal unipotent element acting on the middle homology. According to Clemens this vanishing invariant cycle can be realized as a torus. I conjecture that the SYZ conjecture implies finiteness of the topological types of Hyper-K\"{a}hler manifolds of fix dimension.
