We compute the Bott-Morse Floer cohomology of the Clifford torus in \CP^n with all possible spin-structures. Each spin structure is known to determine an orientation of the moduli space of holomorphic discs, and we analyze the change of orientation according to the change of spin structure of the Clifford torus. Also, we classify all holomorphic discs with boundary lying on the Clifford torus by establishing a Maslov index formula for such discs. As a result, we show that in odd dimensions there exist two spin structures which give non-vanishing Floer cohomology of the Clifford torus, and in even dimensions, there is only one such spin structure. When the Floer cohomology is non-vanishing, it is isomorphic to the singular cohomology of the torus (with a Novikov ring as its coefficients). As a corollary, we prove that any Hamiltonian deformation of the Clifford torus intersects with it at least at 2^n distinct intersection points, when the intersection is transversal.   We also compute the Floer cohomology of the Clifford torus with flat line bundles on it and verify the prediction made by Hori using a mirror symmetry calculation.
