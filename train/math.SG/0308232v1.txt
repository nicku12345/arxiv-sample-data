We investigate (pseudo)differential forms in the framework of supergeometry. Definitions, basic properties and Cartan calculus (DeRham differential, Lie derivative, inner product, Hodge operator) are presented; the symplectic supermechanics (even and odd) is formulated; and the question of quantization is discussed. In the framework of supermechanics, we investigate also classical Hamiltonian systems converting to SUSY-QM after quantization.
