We propose a new method for the construction of Hamiltonian-minimal and minimal Lagrangian immersions of some manifolds in C^n and in CP^n. By this method one can construct, in particular, immersions of such manifolds as the generalized Klein's bottle K^n, the multidimensional torus, K^{n-1}\times S^1, S^{n-1}\times S^1, and others. In some cases these immersions are embeddings. For example, it is possible to embed the following manifolds: K^{2n+1}, S^{2n+1}\times S^1, K^{2n+1}\times S^1, S^{2n+1}\times S^1\times S^1.
