Let L\subset S^3 be a link. We study the Heegaard Floer homology of the branched double-cover \Sigma(L) of S^3, branched along L. When L is an alternating link, \HFa of its branched double-cover has a particularly simple form, determined entirely by the determinant of the link. For the general case, we derive a spectral sequence whose E^2 term is a suitable variant of Khovanov's homology for the link L, converging to the Heegaard Floer homology of \Sigma(L).
