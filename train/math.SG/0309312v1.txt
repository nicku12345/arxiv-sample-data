Let G be a torus and M a compact Hamiltonian G-manifold with finite fixed point set M^G. If T is a circle subgroup of G with M^G=M^T, the T-moment map is a Morse function. We will show that the associated Morse stratification of M by unstable manifolds gives one a canonical basis of K_G(M). A key ingredient in our proof is the notion of local index I_p(a) for a\in K_G(M) and p\in M^G. We will show that corresponding to this stratification there is a basis \tau_p, p\in M^G, for K_G(M) as a module over K_G(\pt) characterized by the property: I_q\tau_p=\delta^q_p. For M a GKM manifold we give an explicit construction of these \tau_p's in terms of the associated GKM graph.
