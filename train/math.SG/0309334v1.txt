For a complex semi-simple group G and its real form G0 we define a Poisson structure on the flag variety of G such that all the Bruhat cells (for a suitable choice of a Borel subgroup of G) as well as all the G0-orbits are Poisson submanifolds. We show that each intersection of a G0-orbit with a Bruhat cell is a regular Poisson submanifold and we compute the dimensions of its symplectic leaves.
