We prove the Arnold-Givental conjecture for a class of Lagrangian submanifolds in Marsden-Weinstein quotients which are fixpoint sets of some antisymplectic involution. For these Lagrangians the Floer homology cannot in general be defined by standard means due to the bubbling phenomenon. To overcome this difficulty we consider moment Floer homology whose boundary operator is defined by counting solutions of the symplectic vortex equations on the strip which have better compactness properties than the original Floer equations.
