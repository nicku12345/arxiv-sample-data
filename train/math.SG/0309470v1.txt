We consider a sequences of symplectic twist maps corresponding to Frenkel Kontorova variational functional. For such a sequence without conjugate points we construct an invariant Lagrangian subbundle. Using the ideas by E.Hopf from Riemannian geometry we show that absence of conjugate points is a rare property for this class of maps.
