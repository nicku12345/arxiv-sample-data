We analyze here Hamiltonian stationary surfaces in the complex projective plane as (local) solutions to an integrable system, formulated as a zero curvature on a loop group. As an application, we show in details why such tori are finite type solutions, and eventually describe the simplest of them: the homogeneous ones.
