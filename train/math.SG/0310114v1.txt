This paper studies symplectic manifolds that admit semi-free circle actions with isolated fixed points. We prove, using results on the Seidel element due to McDuff and Tolman, that the (small) quantum cohomology of a 2n dimensional manifold of this type is isomorphic to the (small) quantum cohomology of a product of n copies of \bb{P}^1. This generalizes a result due to Tolman and Witsman.
