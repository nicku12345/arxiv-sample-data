Floer's chain complexes for Lagrangian submanifolds in closed symplectic manifolds are generated by intersection points of Lagrangian submanifolds and whose differentials count pseudo-holomorphic strips with Lagrangian boundary conditions. In this paper we will propose Floer's chain complexes for Lagrangian submanifolds in symplectic manifolds with concave ends.
