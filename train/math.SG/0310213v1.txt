We consider compact K\"ahler manifolds acted on by a connected compact Lie group K of isometries in Hamiltonian fashion. We prove that the squared moment map \|\mu\|^2 is constant if and only if the manifold is biholomorphically and K-equivariantly isometric to a product of a flag manifold and a compact K\"ahler manifold which is acted on trivially by K. The authors do not know whether the compactness of M is essential in the main theorem; more generally it would be interesting to have a similar result for (compact) symplectic manifolds.
