The notion of homogeneous tensors is discussed. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between multivector fields on a manifold M, homogeneous with respect to a vector field \Delta on M, and first-order polydifferential operators on a closed submanifold N of codimension 1 such that \Delta is transversal to N. This correspondence relates the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket of multivector fields on M to the Schouten-Jacobi bracket of first-order polydifferential operators on N and generalizes the Poissonization of Jacobi manifolds. Actually, it can be viewed as a super-Poissonization. This procedure of passing from a homogeneous multivector field to a first-order polydifferential operator can be also understood as a sort of reduction; in the standard case -- a half of a Poisson reduction. A dual version of the above correspondence yields in particular the correspondence between \Delta-homogeneous symplectic structures on M and contact structures on N.
