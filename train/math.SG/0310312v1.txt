The extension of Banach Lie-Poisson spaces is studied and linked to the extension of a special class of Banach Lie algebras. The case of W*-algebras is given particular attention. Semidirect products and the extension of the restricted Banach Lie-Poisson space by the Banach Lie-Poisson space of compact operators are given as examples.
