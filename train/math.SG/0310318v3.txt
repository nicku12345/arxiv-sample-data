The Banach Poisson geometry of multi-diagonal Hamiltonian systems having infinitely many integrals in involution is studied. It is shown that these systems can be considered as generalizing the semi-infinite Toda lattice which is an example of a bidiagonal system, a case to which special attention is given. The generic coadjoint orbits of the Banach Lie group of bidiagonal bounded operators are studied. It is shown that the infinite dimensional generalization of the Flaschka map is a momentum map. Action-angle variables for the Toda system are constructed.
