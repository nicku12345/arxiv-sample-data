Given the Euclidean space \R^{2n+2} endowed with a constant symplectic structure and the standard flat connection, and given a polynomial of degree 2 on that space, Baguis and Cahen have defined a reduction procedure which yields a symplectic manifold endowed with a Ricci-type connection. We observe that any symplectic manifold of dimension greater than 2 endowed with a symplectic connection of Ricci-type is locally given by a local version of such a reduction.   We also consider the reverse of this reduction procedure, an induction procedure: we construct globally on a symplectic manifold endowed with a connection of Ricci-type (M,\omega,\nabla) a circle or a line bundle which embeds in a flat symplectic manifold (P,\mu ,\nabla^1) as the zero set of a function whose third covariant derivative vanishes, in such a way that (M,\omega,\nabla) is obtained by reduction from (P,\mu ,\nabla^1).   We further develop the particular case of symmetric symplectic manifolds with Ricci-type connections.
