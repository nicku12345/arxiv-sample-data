Complete hyperbolicity of small Euclidean balls with respect to a C^1-smooth almost complex structure standard at origin is improved to give a complete hyperbolicity of strictly pseudoconvex domains. More precise (and lower) regularity assumptions on almost complex structure are made also for another results.
