The main goal of this paper is to prove the following two conjectures for genus up to two:   1. Witten's conjecture on the relations between higher spin curves and Gelfand--Dickey hierarchy.   2. Virasoro conjecture for target manifolds with conformal semisimple Frobenius manifolds.   The main technique used in the proof is the invariance of tautological equations under loop group action.
