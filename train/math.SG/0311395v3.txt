In this article we construct a new family of simply connected symplectic 4-manifolds with b_2^+ =1 and c_1^2 =2 which are not diffeomorphic to rational surfaces by using rational blow-down technique. As a corollary, we conclude that a rational surface {\mathbf CP}^2 \sharp 7{\bar{{\mathbf CP}}^2} admits an exotic smooth structure.
