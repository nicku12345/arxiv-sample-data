We prove that there exist diffeomorphisms of tori, supported in a disc, which are not isotopic to symplectomorphisms with respect to any symplectic structure. This yields a partial negative answer to a question of Benson and Gordon about the existence of symplectic structures on tori with exotic differential structure.
