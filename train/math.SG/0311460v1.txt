This note is motivated by Y.G. Oh's conjecture that the Clifford torus L_n in \mathbb{C}P^n minimizes volume in its Hamiltonian deformation class. We show that there exist explicit positive constants a_n depending on the dimension with a_2=3/\pi such that for any Lagrangian torus L in the Hamiltonian class of L_n we have vol(L) \geq a_n vol (L_n). The proof uses the recent work of C.H. Cho on Floer homology of the Clifford tori. A formula from integral geometry enables us to derive the estimate. We wish to point out that a general lower bound on the volume of L exists from the work of C. Viterbo. Our lower bound a_2= 3/\pi is the best one we know.
