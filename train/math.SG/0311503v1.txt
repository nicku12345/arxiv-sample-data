In this article we prove a rigidity theorem for lagrangian singularities by studying the local cohomology of the lagrangian de Rham complex that was introduced in math.AG/0002083. The result can be applied to show the rigidity of all open swallowtails of dimension greater or equal than two. In the case of lagrangian complete intersection singularities the lagrangian de Rham complex turns out to be perverse. We also show that lagrangian complete intersection in dimension greater than two cannot be regular in codimension one.
