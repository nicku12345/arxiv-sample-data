Let (M, \omega) be a connected, compact 6-dimensional symplectic manifold equipped with a semi-free Hamiltonian S^1 action such that the fixed point set consists of isolated points or surfaces. Assume dim H^2(M)<3, in \cite{L}, we defined a certain invariant of such spaces which consists of fixed point data and twist type, and we divided the possible values of these invariants into six ``types''. In this paper, we construct such manifolds with these ``types''. As a consequence, we have a precise list of the values of these invariants.
