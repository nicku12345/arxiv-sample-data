We consider the phenomenon of forced symmetry breaking in a symmetric Hamiltonian system on a symplectic manifold. In particular we study the persistence of an initial relative equilibrium subjected to this forced symmetry breaking. We see that, under certain nondegeneracy conditions, an estimate can be made on the number of bifurcating relative equilibria.
