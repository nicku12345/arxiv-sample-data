It is known that every nonorientable surface \Sigma has an orientable double cover \tilde{\Sigma}. The covering map induces an involution on the moduli space \tilde{\M} of gauge equivalence classes of flat G-connections on \tilde{\Sigma}. We identify the relation between the moduli space \M and the fixed point set of the moduli space \tilde{\M}. In particular, \M is isomorphic to the fixed point set of \tilde{\M} if and only if the order of the center of G is odd. One important application is that we give a way to construct a minimal Lagrangian submanifold of the moduli space \tilde{\M}.
