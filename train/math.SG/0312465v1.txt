Let M^4 be a smooth compact manifold with a free circle action generated by a vector field X. Then for any invariant symplectic form \omega on M the contracted form \iota_X \omega is nondegenerate. Using the map \omega --> \iota_X \omega and the related map to H^1(M / S^1, R) we study the topology of the space S_{inv} of invariant symplectic forms. In particular we give a description of \pi_0 S_{inv}(M^4) in terms of the unit Thurston ball.
