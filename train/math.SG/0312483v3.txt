In this paper we give concrete estimations for the pseudo symplectic capacities of toric manifolds in combinatorial data. Some examples are given to show that our estimates can compute their pseudo symplectic capacities. As applications we also estimate the symplectic capacities of the polygon spaces. Other related results are impacts of symplectic blow-up on symplectic capacities, symplectic packings in symplectic toric manifolds, the Seshadri constant of an ample line bundle on toric manifolds, and symplectic capacities of symplectic manifolds with S^1-action.
