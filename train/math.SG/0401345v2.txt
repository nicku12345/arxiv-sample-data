We study the invariants of surfaces in 4-manifolds extracted from the Seiberg-Witten and the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants of their fiber sums with auxiliary Lefschetz fibrations. Such invariants involve relative Spin_c structures and can be treated as refinements of the usual Seiberg-Witten and Ozsvath-Szabo invariants. We prove for instance the adjunction inequality for membranes, which estimates their genus.
