The main purpose of this paper is to give a general regularity result for Cauchy-Riemann equations in complex Banach spaces with totally real boundary conditions. The usual elliptic L^p-regularity results hold true under one crucial assumption: The totally real submanifold has to be modelled on an L^p-space or a closed subspace thereof.   Secondly, we describe a class of examples of such totally real submanifolds, namely gauge invariant Lagrangian submanifolds in the space of connections over a Riemann surface. These pose natural boundary conditions for the anti-self-duality equation on 4-manifolds with a boundary space-time splitting, leading towards the definition of a Floer homology for 3-manifolds with boundary, which is the first step in a program by Salamon for the proof of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture. The principal part of such a boundary value problem is an example of a Banach space valued Cauchy-Riemann equation with totally real boundary condition.
