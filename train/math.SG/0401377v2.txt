We study bubbling phenomena of anti-self-dual instantons on \H^2\times\S, where \S is a closed Riemann surface. The restriction of the instanton to each boundary slice \{z\}\times\S, z\in\pd\H^2 is required to lie in a Lagrangian submanifold of the moduli space of flat connections over \S that arises from the restrictions to the boundary of flat connections on a handle body.   We establish an energy quantization result for sequences of instantons with bounded energy near \{0\}\times\S: Either their curvature is in fact uniformly bounded in a neighbourhood of that slice (leading to a compactness result) or there is a concentration of some minimum quantum of energy. We moreover obtain a removable singularity result for instantons with finite energy in a punctured neighbourhood of \{0\}\times\S. This completes the analytic foundations for the construction of an instanton Floer homology for 3-manifolds with boundary. This Floer homology is an intermediate object in the program proposed by Salamon for the proof of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture for homology-3-spheres.   In the interior case, for anti-self-instantons on \R^2\times\S, our methods provide a new approach to the removable singularity theorem by Sibner-Sibner for codimension 2 singularities with a holonomy condition.
