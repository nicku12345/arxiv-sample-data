In the long paper "Family Blowup formula, Admissible Graphs and the Enumeration of Singular Curves (I)" (appearing in JDG), the author solved the enumeration problem of nodal (or general singular) curve counting on algebraic surfaces by using techniques from differential topology/symplectic geometry (including family Seiberg-Witten theory) and some ideas derived from Taubes' "SW=Gr". In the current paper, we offer an algebraic proof of the "universality theorem", showing that the counting of nodal curves for 5\delta-1 very ample complete linear systems are controled by universal polynomials of the characteristic classes. The theorem (implicitly) was the backbone of the earlier long paper(cited above). In the current paper, we derive the result by using intersection theory and the concept of localized contributions of top Chern classes, and therefore relaxing the dependence on the symplectic techniques.
