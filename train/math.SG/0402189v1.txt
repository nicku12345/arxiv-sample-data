Comparing to the Chen-Ruan cohomology theory for the almost complex orbifolds, we study the orbifold cohomology theory for almost contact orbifolds. We define the Chen-Ruan cohomology group of any almost contact orbifold. Using the methods for almost complex orbifolds (see [2]), we define the obstruction bundle for any 3-multisector of the almost contact orbifolds and the Chen-Ruan cup product for the Chen-Ruan cohomology. We also prove that under this cup product the direct sum of all dimensional orbifold cohomology groups constitutes a cohomological ring. Finally we calculate two examples.
