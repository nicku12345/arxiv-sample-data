Lisa Jeffrey and Frances Kirwan developed an integration theory for symplectic reductions. That is, given a symplectic manifold with symplectic group action, they developed a way of pulling the integration of forms on the reduction back to an integration of group-equivariant forms on the original space.   We seek an analogue of the symplectic integration formula as developed by for the hyperKahler case. This is almost straightforward, but we have to overcome such obstacles as the lack of a hyper-Darboux theorem and the lack of compactness in the case of hyperKahler reduction.
