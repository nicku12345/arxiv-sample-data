Let M be a differentiable manifold endowed with a foliation F. A Poisson structure P on M is F-coupling if the image of the annihilator of TF by the sharp-morphism defined by P is a normal bundle of the foliation F. This notion extends Sternberg's coupling symplectic form of a particle in a Yang-Mills field. In the present paper we extend Vorobiev's theory of coupling Poisson structures from fiber bundles to foliations and give simpler proofs of Vorobiev's existence and equivalence theorems of coupling Poisson structures on duals of kernels of transitive Lie algebroids over symplectic manifolds. Then we discuss the extension of the coupling condition to Jacobi structures on foliated manifolds.
