An action selector associates, in a suitable way, to each compactly supported Hamiltonian on a symplectic manifold an action value of the Hamiltonian.   Action selectors are known to exist for a broad class of symplectic manifolds. We show how the existence of an action selector leads to sharp energy capacity inequalities between the Gromov width, the Hofer--Zehnder capacity, and the displacement energy. We also obtain sharp lower bounds for the smallest action of a closed characteristic on contact type hypersurfaces.
