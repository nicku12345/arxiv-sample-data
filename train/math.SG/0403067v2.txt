In this paper we study the behaviour of the Lefschetz property under the blow-up construction. We show that it is possible to reduce the dimension of the kernel of the Lefschetz map if we blow up along a suitable submanifold satisfying the Lefschetz property. We use that, together with results about Massey products, to construct nonformal (simply connected) symplectic manifolds satisfying the Lefschetz property.
