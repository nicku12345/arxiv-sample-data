We show that a certain involution on the well known homology sphere (the boundary of the Mazur manifold) induces a nontrivial homomorphism on its Heegard-Floer homology groups (recently defined by Ozsvath and Szabo). We discuss a possible application of this to constructing exotic smooth structures on 4-manifolds.
