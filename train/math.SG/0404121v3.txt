Lalonde and McDuff showed that the natural action of the rational homology of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold (M, \omega) on the rational homology groups H_*(M,{\mathbb Q}) is trivial. In this note, given a symplectic action of SU(2), \phi:SU(2)\times M \to M, we will construct a symplectic fiber bundle P_\phi\to {\mathbb CP}^2 with fiber (M,\omega) and use it to construct the chains, which bound the images of the homology cycles under the trace map given by the SU(2)-action. It turns out that the natural chains bounded by the SU(2)-orbits in M are punctured {\mathbb CP}^2's, the counter parts of holomorphic discs bounding circles in case of Hamiltonian circle actions. We will also define some invariants of the action \phi and do some explicit calculations.
