We study the derived categories of coherent sheaves of weighted projective spaces and their noncommutative deformations, and the derived categories of Lagrangian vanishing cycles of their mirror Landau-Ginzburg models. In particular, we show that the derived category of coherent sheaves (B-branes) on the weighted projective plane \CP^2(a,b,c) is equivalent to the derived category of vanishing cycles (A-branes) on the affine hypersurface X=\{x^ay^bz^c=1\}\subset (\C^*)^3 equipped with an exact symplectic form and the superpotential W=x+y+z. Hence, the homological mirror symmetry conjecture holds for weighted projective planes. Moreover, we also show that this mirror correspondence between derived categories can be extended to toric noncommutative deformations of \CP^2(a,b,c) where B-branes are concerned, and their mirror counterparts, non-exact deformations of the symplectic structure of X where A-branes are concerned. We also obtain similar results for other examples such as weighted projective lines or Hirzebruch surfaces.
