The well-known fact that any genus g symplectic Lefschetz fibration  X^{4}\to S^{2} is given by a word that is equal to the identity element in the mapping class group and each of whose elements is given by a positive Dehn twist, provides an intimate relationship between words in the mapping class group and 4-manifolds that are realized as symplectic Lefschetz fibrations. In this article we provide new words in the mapping class group, hence new symplectic Lefschetz fibrations. We also compute the signatures of those symplectic Lefschetz fibrations.
