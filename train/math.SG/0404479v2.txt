The harmonic cohomology of a Donaldson symplectic submanifold and of an Auroux symplectic submanifold are compared with that of its ambient space. We also study symplectic manifolds satisfying a weakly Lefschetz property, that is, the s-Lefschetz propery. In particular, we consider the symplectic blow-ups of the complex projective space along weakly Lefschetz symplectic submanifolds. As an application we construct, for each even integer s\geq 2, compact symplectic manifolds which are s-Lefschetz but not (s+1)-Lefschetz.
