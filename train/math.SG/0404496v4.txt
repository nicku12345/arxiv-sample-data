The symplectomorphism group of a 2-dimensional surface is homotopy equivalent to the orbit of a filling system of curves. We give a generalization of this statement to dimension 4. The filling system of curves is replaced by a decomposition of the symplectic 4-manifold (M, omega) into a disjoint union of an isotropic 2-complex L and a disc bundle over a symplectic surface Sigma which is Poincare dual to a multiple of the form omega. We show that then one can recover the homotopy type of the symplectomorphism group of M from the orbit of the pair (L, Sigma). This allows us to compute the homotopy type of certain spaces of Lagrangian submanifolds, for example the space of Lagrangian RP^2 in CP^2 isotopic to the standard one.
