Suppose a compact Lie group acts on a polarized complex projective manifold (M,L). Under favorable circumstances, the Hilbert-Mumford quotient for the action of the complexified group may be described as a symplectic quotient (or reduction). This paper addresses some metric questions arising from this identification, by analyzing the relationship between the Szego kernel of the pair (M,L) and that of the quotient.
