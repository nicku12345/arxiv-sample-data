In this paper, we develop a mini-max theory of the action functional over the semi-infinite cycles via the chain level Floer homology theory and construct spectral invariants of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on arbitrary, especially on {\it non-exact and non-rational}, compact symplectic manifold (M,\omega). To each given time dependent Hamiltonian function H and quantum cohomology class  0 \neq a \in QH^*(M), we associate an invariant \rho(H;a) which varies continuously over H in the C^0-topology. This is obtained as the mini-max value over the semi-infinite cycles whose homology class is `dual' to the given quantum cohomology class a on the covering space \widetilde \Omega_0(M) of the contractible loop space \Omega_0(M). We call them the {\it Novikov Floer cycles}. We apply the spectral invariants to the study of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms in sequels of this paper.
