Extending work of Chen, we prove the Weinstein conjecture in dimension three for strongly fillable contact structures with either non-vanishing first Chern class or with strong and exact filling having non-trivial canonical bundle. This implies the Weinstein conjecture for certain Stein fillable contact structures obtained by the Eliashberg-Gompf construction.For example we prove the Weinstein conjecture for the Brieskorn homology spheres \Sigma(2,3,6n-1), n\geq2, oriented as the boundary of the corresponding Milnor fibre. Furthermore, for tight contact structures on odd lens spaces, non-contractible closed Reeb orbits are found.
