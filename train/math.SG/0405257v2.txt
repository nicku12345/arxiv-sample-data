We give a local normal form for Dirac structures. As a consequence, we show that the dimensions of the pre-symplectic leaves of a Dirac manifold have the same parity. We also show that, given a point m of a Dirac manifold M, there is a well-defined transverse Poisson structure to the pre-symplectic leaf P through m. Finally, we describe the neighborhood of a pre-symplectic leaf in terms of geometric data. This description agrees with that given by Vorobjev for the Poisson case
