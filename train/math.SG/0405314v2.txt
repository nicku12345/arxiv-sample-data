We calculate the Heegaard Floer homologiesHF^+(M,s) for mapping tori M associated to certain surface diffeomorphisms, where s is any Spin^c structure on M whose first Chern class is non-torsion. Let gamma and delta be a pair of geometrically dual nonseparating curves on a genus g Riemann surface Sigma_g, and let sigma be a curve separating Sigma_g into components of genus 1 and g-1. Write t-gamma, t_delta, and t_sigma for the right-handed Dehn twists about each of these curves. The examples we consider are the mapping tori of the diffeomorphisms t_gamma^m circ t_delta^n for m,n in Z and that of t_sigma^{+-1}.
