Let M be a Hamiltonian T space with a proper moment map, bounded below in some component. In this setting, we give a combinatorial description of the T-equivariant cohomology of M, extending results of Goresky, Kottwitz and MacPherson and techniques of Tolman and Weitsman. Moreover, when M is equipped with an antisymplectic involution \sigma anticommuting with the action of T, we also extend to this noncompact setting the ``mod 2'' versions of these results to the real locus Q:= M^\sigma of M. We give applications of these results to the theory of hypertoric varieties.
