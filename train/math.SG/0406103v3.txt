For each compact almost Kahler manifold (X,\om,J) and an element A of H_2(X;Z), we describe a closed subspace \ov{\frak M}_{1,k}^0(X,A;J) of the moduli space \ov{\frak M}_{1,k}(X,A;J) of stable J-holomorphic genus-one maps such that \ov{\frak M}_{1,k}^0(X,A;J) contains all stable maps with smooth domains. If (P^n,\om,J_0) is the standard complex projective space, \ov{\frak M}_{1,k}^0(P^n,A;J_0) is an irreducible component of \ov{\frak M}_{1,k}(P^n,A;J_0). We also show that if an almost complex structure J on P^n is sufficiently close to J_0, the structure of the space \ov{\frak M}_{1,k}^0(P^n,A;J) is similar to that of \ov{\frak M}_{1,k}^0(P^n,A;J_0). This paper's compactness and structure theorems lead to new invariants for some symplectic manifolds, which are generalized to arbitrary symplectic manifolds in a separate paper. Relatedly, the smaller moduli space \ov\M_{1,k}^0(X,A;J) is useful for computing the genus-one Gromov-Witten invariants, which arise from the larger moduli space \ov\M_{1,k}(X,A;J).
