We compute in this note the full homotopy type of the space of symplectic embeddings of the standard ball B^4(c) \subset \R^4 (where c= \pi r^2 is the capacity of the standard ball of radius r) into the 4-dimensional rational symplectic manifold M_{\mu}= (S^2 \times S^2, \mu \om_0 \oplus \om_0) where \om_0 is the area form on the sphere with total area 1 and \mu belongs to the interval (1,2]. We know, by the work of Lalonde-Pinsonnault, that this space retracts to the space of symplectic frames of M_{\mu} for any value of c smaller than the critical value \mu -1, and that its homotopy type does change when c crosses that value. In this paper, we compute the homotopy type for the case c \ge \mu-1 and prove that it is not the type of a finite CW-complex.
