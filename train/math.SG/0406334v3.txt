In this note we show the following result using the integral-geometric formula of R. Howard: Consider the totally geodesic \mathbb{R}P^{2m} in \mathbb{C}P^n. Then it minimizes volume among the isotropic submanifolds in the same \mathbb{Z}/2 homology class in \mathbb{C}P^n (but not among all submanifolds in this \mathbb{Z}/2 homology class). Also the totally geodesic \mathbb{R}P^{2m-1} minimizes volume in its Hamiltonian deformation class in \mathbb{C}P^n. As a corollary we'll give estimates for volumes of Lagrangian submanifolds in complete intersections in \mathbb{C}P^n.
