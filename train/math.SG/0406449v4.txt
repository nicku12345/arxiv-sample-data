The author previously defined the spectral invariants, denoted by \rho(H;a), of a Hamiltonian function H as the mini-max value of the action functional \AA_H over the Novikov Floer cycles in the Floer homology class dual to the quantum cohomology class a. The spectrality axiom of the invariant \rho(H;a) states that the mini-max value is a critical value of the action functional \AA_H. The main purpose of the present paper is to prove this axiom for {\it nondegenerate} Hamiltonian functions in {\it irrational} symplectic manifolds (M,\omega). We also prove that the spectral invariant function \rho_a: H \mapsto \rho(H;a) can be pushed down to a {\it continuous} function defined on the universal ({\it \'etale}) covering space \widetilde{Ham}(M,\omega) of the group Ham(M,\omega) of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on general (M,\omega). For a certain generic homotopy, which we call a {\it Cerf homotopy} \HH = \{H^s\}_{0 \leq s\leq 1} of Hamiltonians, the function \rho_a \circ \HH: s \mapsto \rho(H^s;a) is piecewise smooth away from a countable subset of [0,1] for each non-zero quantum cohomology class a.   The proof of this nondegenerate spectrality relies on several new ingredients in the chain level Floer theory, which have their own independent interest: a structure theorem on the Cerf bifurcation diagram of the critical values of the action functionals associated to a generic one-parameter family of Hamiltonian functions, a general structure theorem and the handle sliding lemma of Novikov Floer cycles over such a family and a {\it family version} of new transversality statements involving the Floer chain map, and many others. We call this chain level Floer theory as a whole the {\it Floer mini-max theory}.
