Let G be a Lie groupoid with Lie algebroid g. It is known that, unlike in the case of Lie groups, not every subalgebroid of g can be integrated by a subgroupoid of G. In this paper we study conditions on the invariant foliation defined by a given subalgebroid under which such an integration is possible. We also consider the problem of integrability by closed subgroupoids, and we give conditions under which the closure of a subgroupoid is again a subgroupoid.
