In this paper we propose a way to construct an analytic space over a non-archimedean field, starting with a real manifold with an affine structure which has integral monodromy. Our construction is motivated by the junction of Homological Mirror conjecture and geometric Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture. In particular, we glue from "flat pieces" an analytic K3 surface. As a byproduct of our approach we obtain an action of an arithmetic subgroup of the group SO(1,18) by piecewise-linear transformations on the 2-dimensional sphere S^2 equipped with naturally defined singular affine structure.
