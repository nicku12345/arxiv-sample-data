We extend knot contact homology to a theory over the ring \mathbb{Z}[\lambda^{\pm 1},\mu^{\pm 1}], with the invariant given topologically and combinatorially. The improved invariant, which is defined for framed knots in S^3 and can be generalized to knots in arbitrary manifolds, distinguishes the unknot and can distinguish mutants. It contains the Alexander polynomial and naturally produces a two-variable polynomial knot invariant which is related to the A-polynomial.
