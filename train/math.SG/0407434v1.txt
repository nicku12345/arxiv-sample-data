We complete the reduction of Sasakian manifolds with the non-zero case by showing that Willett's contact reduced space is compatible with the Sasakian structure. We then prove the compatibility of the non-zero Sasakian (in particular, contact) reduction with the reduction of the K\"ahler (in particular, symplectic) cone. We provide examples obtained by toric actions on Sasakian spheres and make some comments concerning the curvature of the quotients.
