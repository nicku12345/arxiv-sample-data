We present a deRham model for Chen-Ruan cohomology ring of abelian orbifolds. We introduce the notion of \emph{twist factors} so that formally the stringy cohomology ring can be defined without going through pseudo-holomorphic orbifold curves. Thus our model can be viewed as the classical description of Chen-Ruan cohomology for abelian orbifolds. The model simplifies computation of Chen-Ruan cohomology ring. Using our model, we give a version of wall crossing formula.
