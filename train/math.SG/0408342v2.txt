A commutative Poisson subalgebra of the Poisson algebra of polynomials on the Lie algebra of n x n matrices over {\Bbb C} is introduced which is the Poisson analogue of the Gelfand-Zeitlin subalgebra of the universal enveloping algebra. As a commutative algebra it is a polynomial ring in n(n+1)/2 generators, n of which can be taken to be basic generators of the polynomial invariants. Any choice of the next n(n-1)/2 generators yields a Lie algebra of vector fields that generates a global holomorphic action of the additive group {\Bbb C}^{n(n -1)/2}. This paper proves several remarkable properties of this group action and relates it to the theory of orthogonal polynomials.
