A connection between holomorphic and generating family invariants of Legendrian knots is established; namely, that the existence of a ruling (or decomposition) of a Legendrian knot is equivalent to the existence of an augmentation of its contact homology. This result was obtained independently and using different methods by Fuchs and Ishkhanov. Close examination of the proof yields an algorithm for constructing a ruling given an augmentation. Finally, a condition for the existence of an augmentation in terms of the rotation number is obtained.
