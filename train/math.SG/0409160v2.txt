We say that a contact manifold is Milnor fillable if it is contactomorphic to the contact boundary of an isolated complex-analytic singularity (X,x). Generalizing results of Milnor and Giroux, we associate to each holomorphic function f defined on X, with isolated singularity at x, an open book which supports the contact structure. Moreover, we prove that any 3-dimensional oriented manifold admits at most one Milnor fillable contact structure up to contactomorphism.   * * * * * * * *   In the first version of the paper, we showed that the open book associated to f carries the contact structure only up to an isotopy. Here we drop this restriction. Following a suggestion of Janos Kollar, we also give a simplified proof of the algebro-geometrical theorem 4.1, central for the uniqueness result.
