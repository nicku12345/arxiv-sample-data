We give a simple model in the complex plane of the 0-surgery along a fibered knot of a closed 3-manifold M to yield a mapping torus M'. This model allows explicit relations between pseudoholomorphic curves in the symplectizations of M and M'. As an application we use it to compute the cylindrical contact homology of open books resulting from a positive Dehn twist on a torus with boundary.
