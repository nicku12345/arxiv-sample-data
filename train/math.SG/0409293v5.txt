Consider a 2-plane P \subset \mathbb{C}^n and let D be a bounded region in P with a piecewise-smooth boundary. Let I(D) be the infimum of areas of all piecewise-smooth isotropic surfaces in \mathbb{C}^n with the same boundary as D. Then I(D)= \lambda_P^n \cdot Area(D). If P is not complex, \lambda_P^n < \frac{3\pi}{2\sqrt{2}}. For a complex plane \mathbb{C} \subset \mathbb{C}^n, \lambda_{\mathbb{C}}^n \geq 2, \lambda_{\mathbb{C}}^2 \geq 3 and also \frac{3\pi^2}{2\sqrt{2}} is the area of an explicit Hamiltonian stationary isotropic Mobius band embedded in \mathbb{C}^n whose boundary is a unit circle in \mathbb{C}. As a corollary, a compact surface \Sigma (possibly with boundary) in a symplectic manifold can be approximated by isotropic surfaces of area \leq \frac{3\pi}{2\sqrt{2}} Area(\Sigma). Another corollary is that a closed curve of length l in \mathbb{C}^n bounds an isotropic surface of area \leq \frac{3l^2}{8\sqrt{2}}. A related result is the following: consider \mathbb{C}P^1 \subset \mathbb{C}P^n and let D be a region in \mathbb{C}P^1. Let I(D) be the infimum of areas of all isotropic surfaces in \mathbb{C}P^n with the same boundary as D representing the same relative homology class mod 2 as D. Then  2 \cdot Area(D) \leq I(D) \leq \lambda_{\mathbb{C}}^n \cdot Area(D). Moreover the first inequality becomes an equality for D=\mathbb{C}P^1.
