In this paper we describe a general strategy for approaching the Weinstein conjecture in dimension three. We apply this approach to prove the Weinstein conjecture for a new class of contact manifolds (planar contact manifolds). We also discuss how the present approach reduces the general Weinstein conjecture in dimension three to a compactness problem for the solution set of a first order elliptic PDE.
