The embedded contact homology (ECH) of a 3-manifold with a contact form is a variant of Eliashberg-Givental-Hofer's symplectic field theory, which counts certain embedded J-holomorphic curves in the symplectization. We show that the ECH of T^3 is computed by a combinatorial chain complex which is generated by labeled convex polygons in the plane with vertices at lattice points, and whose differential involves `rounding corners'. We compute the homology of this combinatorial chain complex. The answer agrees with the Ozsvath--Szabo Floer homology HF^+(T^3).
