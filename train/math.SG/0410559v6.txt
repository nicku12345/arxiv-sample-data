We prove a generalization of Bennequin's inequality for Legendrian knots in a 3-dimensional contact manifold (Y,xi), under the assumption that Y is the boundary of a 4-dimensional manifold M and the version of Seiberg-Witten invariants introduced by Kronheimer and Mrowka [Invent. Math. 130 (1997) 209-255] is nonvanishing. The proof requires an excision result for Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces; then the Bennequin inequality becomes a special case of the adjunction inequality for surfaces lying inside M.
