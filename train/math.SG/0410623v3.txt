We define a nonnegative integer \la(L,L_0;\phi) for a pair of diffeomorphic closed Lagrangian surfaces L_0,L embedded in a symplectic 4-manifold (M,\w) and a diffeomorphism \phi\in\Diff^+(M) satisfying \phi(L_0)=L. We prove that if there exists \phi\in\Diff^+_o(M) with \phi(L_0)=L and \la(L,L_0;\phi)=0, then L_0,L are symplectomorphic. We also define a second invariant n(L_1,L_0;[L_t])=n(L_1,L_0,[\phi_t]) for a smooth isotopy L_t=\phi_t(L_0) between two Lagrangian surfaces L_0 and L_1 with \la (L_1,L_0;\phi_1)=0, which serves as an obstruction of deforming L_t to a Lagrangian isotopy with L_0,L_1 preserved.
