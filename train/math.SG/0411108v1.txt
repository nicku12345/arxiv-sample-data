Consider any symplectic ruled surface (M^g_{\lambda},\omega_{\lambda}) given by (\Sigma_g \times S^2, \lambda \sigma_{\Sigma_g} \oplus \sigma_{S^2}). We compute all natural equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants EGW_{g,0}(M^g_{\lambda};H_k, A-kF) for all hamiltonian circle actions H_k on M^g_{\lambda}, where A=[\Sigma_g \times pt] and F= [pt \times S^2]. We use these invariants to show the nontriviality of certain higher order Whitehead products that live in the homotopy groups of the symplectomorphism groups G_{\lambda}^g, g \geq 0. Our results are sharper when g=0,1 and enable us to answer a question posed by D.McDuff in the case g=1 and provide a new interpretation of the multiplicative structure in the ring H^*(BG^0_{\lambda} ;\Q) found by Abreu-McDuff.
