We consider compact symplectic manifolds acted on effectively by a compact connected Lie group K in a Hamiltonian fashion. We prove that the squared moment map ||\mu||^2 is constant if and only if K is semisimple and the manifold is K-equivariantly symplectomorphic to a product of a flag manifold and a compact symplectic manifold which is acted on trivially by K. In the almost-K\"ahler setting the symplectomorphism turns out to be an isometry.
