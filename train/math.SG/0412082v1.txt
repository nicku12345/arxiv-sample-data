We show that each triangular Poisson Lie group can be decomposed into Poisson submanifolds each of which is a quotient of a symplectic manifold. The Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer symplectic reduction technique is then used to give a complete description of the symplectic foliation of all triangular Poisson structures on Lie groups. The results are illustrated in detail for the generalized Jordanian Poisson structures on SL(n).
