In this paper we use Floer theory to study topological restrictions on Lagrangian embeddings in closed symplectic manifolds. One of the phenomena arising from our results is ``homological rigidity'' of Lagrangian submanifolds. Namely, in certain symplectic manifolds, conditions on low dimensional topological invariants of a Lagrangian (such as its first homology) completely determine its entire homology.   We also develop methods for studying Hamiltonian displacement of Lagrangian submanifolds and its relations to the topology of Lagrangians. Finally we present some new results on Lagrangian intersections.
