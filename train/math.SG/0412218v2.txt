Suppose that an algebraic torus G acts algebraically on a projective manifold X with generically trivial stabilizers. Then the Zariski closure of the set of pairs \{(x,y)\in X\times X\mid y=gx \text{for some}g\in G\} defines a nonzero equivariant cohomology class [\Delta_G]\in H^*_{G\times G}(X\times X). We give an analogue of this construction in the case where X is a compact symplectic manifold endowed with a hamiltonian action of a torus, whose complexification plays the role of G. We also prove that the Kirwan map sends the class [\Delta_G] to the class of the diagonal in each symplectic quotient. This allows to define a canonical right inverse of the Kirwan map.
