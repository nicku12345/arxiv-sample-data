We first recall some basic definitions and facts about Jacobi manifolds, generalized Lie bialgebroids, generalized Courant algebroids and Dirac structures. We establish an one-one correspondence between reducible Dirac structures of the generalized Lie bialgebroid of a Jacobi manifold (M,\Lambda,E) for which 1 is an admissible function and Jacobi quotient manifolds of M. We study Jacobi reductions from the point of view of Dirac structures theory and we present some examples and applications.
