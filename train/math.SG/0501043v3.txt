We show there is a symplectic conifold transition of a projective 3-fold which is not deformation equivalent to any Kaehler manifold. The key ingredient is Mori's classification of extremal rays on smooth projective 3-folds. It follows that there is a Lagrangian sphere in a projective variety which is not the vanishing cycle of any Kaehler degeneration, answering a question of Donaldson.
