We use the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o contact invariants to distinguish between tight contact structures obtained by Legendrian surgeries on stabilized Legendrian links in tight contact 3-manifolds. We also discuss the implication of our result on the tight contact structures on the Brieskon homology spheres -\Sigma(2,3,6n-1).
