We study the stability of singular points for smooth Poisson structures as well as general Lie algebroids. We give sufficient conditions for stability lying on the first (not necessarily linear) approximation of the given Poisson structure or Lie algebroid at a singular point. The main tools used here are the classical Lichnerowicz-Poisson cohomology and the deformation cohomology for Lie algebroids recently introduced by Crainic and Moerdijk. We also provide several examples of stable singular points of order k \geq 1 for Poisson structures and Lie algebroids. Finally, we apply our results to pre-symplectic leaves of Dirac manifolds.
