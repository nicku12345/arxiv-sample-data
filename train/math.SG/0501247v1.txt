We study coisotropic A-branes in the sigma model on a four-torus by explicitly constructing examples. We find that morphisms between coisotropic branes can be equated with a fundamental representation of the noncommutatively deformed algebra of functions on the intersection. The noncommutativity parameter is expressed in terms of the bundles on the branes. We conjecture these findings hold in general. To check mirror symmetry, we verify that the dimensions of morphism spaces are equal to the corresponding dimensions of morphisms between mirror objects.
