We produce examples of generalized complex structures on manifolds by generalizing results from symplectic and complex geometry. We produce generalized complex structures on symplectic fibrations over a generalized complex base. We study in some detail different invariant generalized complex structures on compact Lie groups and provide a thorough description of invariant structures on nilmanifolds, achieving a classification on 6-nilmanifolds.   We study implications of the `dd^c-lemma' in the generalized complex setting. Similarly to the standard dd^c-lemma, its generalized version induces a decomposition of the cohomology of a manifold and causes the degeneracy of the spectral sequence associated to the splitting d = \del + \delbar at E_1. But, in contrast with the dd^c-lemma, its generalized version is not preserved by symplectic blow-up or blow-down (in the case of a generalized complex structure induced by a symplectic structure) and does not imply formality.
