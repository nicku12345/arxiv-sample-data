We show that the Clifford torus and the totally geodesic real projective plane RP^2 in the complex projective plane CP^2 are the unique Hamiltonian stable minimal Lagrangian compact surfaces of CP^2 with genus less than or equal to 4, when the surface is orientable, and with Euler characteristic greater than or equal to -1, when the surface is nonorientable. Also we characterize RP^2 in CP^2 as the least possible index minimal Lagrangian compact nonorientable surface of CP^2.
