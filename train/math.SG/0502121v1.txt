An existence theorem for stationary discs of strongly pseudoconvex domains in almost complex manifolds is proved. More precisely, it is shown that, for all points of a suitable neighborhood of the boundary and for any vector belonging to certain open subsets of the tangent spaces there exists a unique stationary disc passing through that point and tangent to the given vector.
