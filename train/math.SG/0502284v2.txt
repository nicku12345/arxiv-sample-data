We examine the structure of the cotangent bundle T^{*}X of an algebraic variety X acted on by a reductive group G from the viewpoint of equivariant symplectic geometry. In particular, we construct an equivariant symplectic covering of T^{*}X by the cotangent bundle of a certain variety of horospheres in X, and integrate the invariant collective motion on T^{*}X. These results are based on a "local structure theorem" describing the action of a certain parabolic in G on an open subset of X, which is interesting by itself.
