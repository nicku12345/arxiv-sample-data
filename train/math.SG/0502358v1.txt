Let (X, \omega, c_X) be a real symplectic 4-manifold with real part R X. Let L \subset R X be a smooth curve such that [L] = 0 \in H_1 (R X ; Z / 2Z). We construct invariants under deformation of the quadruple (X, \omega, c_X, L) by counting the number of real rational J-holomorphic curves which realize a given homology class d, pass through an appropriate number of points and are tangent to L. As an application, we prove a relation between the count of real rational J-holomorphic curves done in math.AG/0303145 and the count of reducible real rational curves done in math.SG/0502355. Finally, we show how these techniques also allow to extract an integer valued invariant from a classical problem of real enumerative geometry, namely about counting the number of real plane conics tangent to five given generic real conics.
