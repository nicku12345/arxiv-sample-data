We introduce the_inertial cohomology ring_ NH^*_T(Y) of a stably almost complex manifold carrying an action of a torus T. We show that in the case that Y has a locally free action by T, the inertial cohomology ring is isomorphic to the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring H_{CR}^*(Y/T) of the quotient orbifold Y/T.   For Y a compact Hamiltonian T-space, we extend to orbifold cohomology two techniques that are standard in ordinary cohomology. We show that NH^*_T(Y) has a natural ring surjection onto H_{CR}^*(Y//T), where Y//T is the symplectic reduction of Y by T at a regular value of the moment map. We extend to NH^*_T(Y) the graphical GKM calculus (as detailed in e.g. [Harada-Henriques-Holm]), and the kernel computations of [Tolman-Weitsman, Goldin].   We detail this technology in two examples: toric orbifolds and weight varieties, which are symplectic reductions of flag manifolds. The Chen-Ruan ring has been computed for toric orbifolds, with \Q coefficients, in [Borisov-Chen-Smith]); symplectic toric orbifolds obtained by reduction by a connected torus (though with different computational methods), and extend them to \Z coefficients in certain cases, including weighted projective spaces.
