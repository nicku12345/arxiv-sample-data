We consider locally conformal Kaehler geometry as an equivariant (homothetic) Kaehler geometry: a locally conformal Kaehler manifold is, up to equivalence, a pair (K,\Gamma) where K is a Kaehler manifold and \Gamma a discrete Lie group of biholomorphic homotheties acting freely and properly discontinuously.   We define a new invariant of a locally conformal Kaehler manifold (K,\Gamma) as the rank of a natural quotient of \Gamma, and prove its invariance under reduction. This equivariant point of view leads to a proof that locally conformal Kaehler reduction of compact Vaisman manifolds produces Vaisman manifolds and is equivalent to a Sasakian reduction.   Moreover we define locally conformal hyperkaehler reduction as an equivariant version of hyperkaehler reduction and in the compact case we show its equivalence with 3-Sasakian reduction. Finally we show that locally conformal hyperkaehler reduction induces hyperkaehler with torsion (HKT) reduction of the associated HKT structure and the two reductions are compatible, even though not every HKT reduction comes from a locally conformal hyperkaehler reduction.
