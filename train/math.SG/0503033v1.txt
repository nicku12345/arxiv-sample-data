It is shown that Legendrian (resp. transverse) cable links in the 3-sphere with its standard tight contact structure, i.e. links consisting of an unknot and a cable of that unknot, are classified by their oriented link type and the classical invariants (Thurston-Bennequin invariant and rotation number in the Legendrian case, self-linking number in the transverse case). The analogous result is proved for torus knots in the 1-jet space of the circle with its standard tight contact structure.
