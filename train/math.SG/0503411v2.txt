Let M be a closed connected smooth manifold and G=\textmd{Diff}_0(M) denote the connected component of the diffeomorphism group of M containing the identity. The natural action of G on M induces the trace homomorphism on homology. We show that the image of trace homomorphism is annihilated by the subalgebra of the cohomology ring of M, generated by the characteristic classes of M. Analogously, if J is an almost complex structure on M and G denotes the identity component of the group of diffeomorphisms of M preserving J then the image of the corresponding trace homomorphism is annihilated by subalgebra generated by the Chern classes of (M,J).
