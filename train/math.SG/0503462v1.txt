We establish some fundamental relations between Dirac subbundles L for the generalized Courant algebroid (A\oplus A^{\ast}, \phi+W) over a differentiable manifold M and the associated Dirac subbubndles \tilde{L} for the corresponding Courant algebroid \tilde{A} \oplus \tilde{A}^{\ast} over M\times \R.
