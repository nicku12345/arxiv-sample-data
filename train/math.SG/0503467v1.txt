Recall that an effective circle action is semifree if the stabilizer subgroup of each point is connected. We show that if (M, \om) is a coadjoint orbit of a compact Lie group G then every element of \pi_1(G) may be represented by a semifree S^1-action. A theorem of McDuff--Slimowitz then implies that \pi_1(G) injects into \pi_1(\Ham(M, \om)), which answers a question raised by Weinstein. We also show that a circle action on a manifold M which is semifree near a fixed point x cannot contract in a compact Lie subgroup G of the diffeomorphism group unless the action is reversed by an element of G that fixes the point x. Similarly, if a circle acts in a Hamiltonian fashion on a manifold (M,\omega) and the stabilizer of every point has at most two components, then the circle cannot contract in a compact Lie subgroup of the group of Hamiltonian symplectomorphism unless the circle is reversed by an element of G
