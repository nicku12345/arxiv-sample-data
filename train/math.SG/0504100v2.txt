We define a class of symplectic fibrations called symplectic configurations. They are natural generalization of Hamiltonian fibrations. Their geometric and topological properties are investigated. We are mainly concentrated on integral symplectic manifolds.   We construct the classifyng space \B of symplectic integral configurations. The properties of the classifying map \B --> BSymp(M,w) are examined. The universal symplectic bundle over \B has a natural connection whose holonomy group is isomorphic to the enlarged Hamiltonian group recently defined by McDuff.   The space \B is identified with the classifying space of an extension of certain subgroup of the symplectomorphism group.
