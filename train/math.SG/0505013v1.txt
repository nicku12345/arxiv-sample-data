This is the second part of an article in two parts, which builds the foundation of a Floer-theoretic invariant, I_F. (See math.DG/0111313 for part I).   Having constructed I_F and outlined a proof of its invariance based on bifurcation analysis in part I, in this part we prove a series of gluing theorems to confirm the bifurcation behavior predicted in part I. These gluing theorems are different from (and much harder than) the more conventional versions in that they deal with broken trajectories or broken orbits connected at degenerate rest points. The issues of orientation and signs are also settled in the last section.
