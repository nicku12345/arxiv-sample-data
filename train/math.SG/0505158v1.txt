Lie algebroids can not always be integrated into Lie groupoids. We introduce a new object--``Weinstein groupoid'', which is a differentiable stack with groupoid-like axioms. With it, we have solved the integration problem of Lie algebroids. It turns out that every Weinstein groupoid has a Lie algebroid, and every Lie algebroid can be integrated into a Weinstein groupoid.   Furthermore, we apply this general result to Jacobi manifolds and construct contact groupoids for Jacobi manifolds. There are further applications in prequantization and integrability of Poisson bivectors.
