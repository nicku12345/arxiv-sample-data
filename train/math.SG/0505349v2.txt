L-spaces were introduced by Ozsvath and Szabo using the Heegaard Floer Homology. In the quest for L-spaces we consider links of isolated complete intersection surface singularities. We show that if such a manifold is an L-space, then it is a link of a rational singularity. We also prove that if it is not an L-space then it admits a symplectic filling with b_2^+>0. Based on these results we pin down all integral homology sphere L-spaces in this realm.
