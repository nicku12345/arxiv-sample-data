This paper studies intersection theory on the compactified moduli space M(n,d) of holomorphic bundles of rank n and degree d over a fixed compact Riemann surface of genus g > 1 where n and d may have common factors. Because of the presence of singularities we work with the intersection cohomology groups defined by Goresky and MacPherson and the ordinary cohomology groups of a certain partial resolution of singularities of M(n,d). Based on our earlier work, we give a precise formula for the intersection cohomology pairing and provide a method to calculate pairings on the partial resolution of singularities of M(n,d). The case when n=2 is discussed in detail. Finally Witten's integral is considered for this singular case.
