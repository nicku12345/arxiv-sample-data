A rigorous foundation for the contact homology of Legendrian submanifolds in a contact manifold of the form P\times \R where P is an exact symplectic manifold is established. The class of such contact manifolds include 1-jet spaces of smooth manifolds. As an application, contact homology is used to provide (smooth) isotopy invariants of submanifolds of \R^n and, more generally, invariants of self transverse immersions into \R^n up to restricted regular homotopies. When n=3, this application is the first step in extending and providing a contact geometric underpinning for the new knot invariants of Ng
