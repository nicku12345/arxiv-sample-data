We investigate the extrinsic topology of Lagrangian submanifolds and of their submanifolds in closed symplectic manifolds using Floer homological methods. The first result asserts that the homology class of a displaceable monotone Lagrangian submanifold vanishes in the homology of the ambient symplectic manifold. Combining this with spectral invariants we provide a new mechanism for proving Lagrangian intersection results e.g. entailing that any two simply connected Lagrangian submanifold in \CP^n\times\CP^n must intersect.
