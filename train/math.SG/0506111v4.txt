Given a vector bundle F on a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack \X and an invertible multiplicative characteristic class \bc, we define the orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants of \X twisted by F and \bc. We prove a "quantum Riemann-Roch theorem" which expresses the generating function of the twisted invariants in terms of the generating function of the untwisted invariants. A Quantum Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem is derived from this by specializing to genus zero. As an application, we determine the relationship between genus-0 orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants of \X and that of a complete intersection. This provides a way to verify mirror symmetry predictions for complete intersection orbifolds.
