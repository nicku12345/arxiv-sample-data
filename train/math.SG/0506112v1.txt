Let U(n) be the unitary group, and u(n)^* the dual of its Lie algebra, equipped with the Kirillov Poisson structure. In their 1983 paper, Guillemin-Sternberg introduced a densely defined Hamiltonian action of a torus of dimension (n-1)n/2 on u(n)^*, with moment map given by the Gelfand-Zeitlin coordinates. A few years later, Flaschka-Ratiu described a similar, `multiplicative' Gelfand-Zeitlin system for the Poisson Lie group U(n)^*.   By the Ginzburg-Weinstein theorem, U(n)^* is isomorphic to u(n)^* as a Poisson manifold. Flaschka-Ratiu conjectured that one can choose the Ginzburg-Weinstein diffeomorphism in such a way that it intertwines the linear and nonlinear Gelfand-Zeitlin systems. Our main result gives a proof of this conjecture, and produces a canonical Ginzburg-Weinstein diffeomorphism.
