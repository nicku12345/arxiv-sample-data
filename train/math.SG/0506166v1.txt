We study homological mirror symmetry for Del Pezzo surfaces and their mirror Landau-Ginzburg models. In particular, we show that the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Del Pezzo surface X_k obtained by blowing up CP^2 at k points is equivalent to the derived category of vanishing cycles of a certain elliptic fibration W_k:M_k\to\C with k+3 singular fibers, equipped with a suitable symplectic form. Moreover, we also show that this mirror correspondence between derived categories can be extended to noncommutative deformations of X_k, and give an explicit correspondence between the deformation parameters for X_k and the cohomology class [B+i\omega]\in H^2(M_k,C).
