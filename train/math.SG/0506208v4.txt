Ozsvath and Szabo proved that knot Floer homology determines the genera of knots in S^3. We will generalize this deep result to links in homology 3-spheres, by adapting their method. Our proof relies on a result of Gabai and some constructions related to foliations. We also interpret a theorem of Kauffman in the world of knot Floer homology, hence we can compute the top filtration term of the knot Floer homology for alternative links.
