This is mainly a survey of recent work on algebraic ways to ``measure'' moduli spaces of connecting trajectories in Morse and Floer theories as well as related applications to symplectic topology. The paper also contains some new results. In particular, we show that the methods of a previous work (http://fr.arXiv.org/find/math/1/barraud/0/1/0/2004/3/0) continue to work in general symplectic manifolds (without any connectivity conditions) but under the bubbling threshold.
