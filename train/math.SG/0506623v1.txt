This paper studies singular contact reduction for cosphere bundles at the zero value of the momentum map. A stratification of the singular quotient, finer than the contact one and better adapted to the bundle structure of the problem, is obtained. The strata of this new stratification are a collection of cosphere bundles and coisotropic or Legendrian submanifolds of their corresponding contact components.
