In a previous paper we described a natural closed subset of the moduli space of stable genus-one J-holomorphic maps into a symplectic manifold X. In this paper we generalize the definition of the main component to moduli spaces of perturbed, in a restricted way, J-holomorphic maps. This generalization implies that the main component, just like the entire moduli space, carries a virtual fundamental class and can be used to define symplectic invariants. These truly genus-one invariants constitute part of the standard genus-one Gromov-Witten invariants, which arise from the entire moduli space. The new invariants are more geometric and can be used to compute the genus-one GW-invariants of complete intersections, as shown in a separate paper.
