Ozsvath and Szabo defined an analog of the Froyshov invariant in the form of a correction term for the grading in Heegaard Floer homology. Applying this to the double cover of the 3-sphere branched over a knot K, we obtain an invariant delta of knot concordance. We show that delta is determined by the signature for alternating knots and knots with up to nine crossings, and conjecture a similar relation for all H-thin knots. We also use delta to prove that for all knots K with tau(K)>0, the positive untwisted double of K is not smoothly slice.
