In this paper we present a construction of Ricci-flat connections through an induction procedure. Given a symplectic manifold (M,\omega) of dimension 2n, we define induction as a way to construct a symplectic manifold (P,\mu) of dimension 2n+2. Given any symplectic connection \nabla on (M,\omega), we define an induced connection \nabla^P which is a Ricci-flat symplectic connection on (P,\mu).
