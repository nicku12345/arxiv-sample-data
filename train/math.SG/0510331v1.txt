In 2001, S. Barannikov showed that the Frobenius manifold coming from the quantum cohomology of the complex projective space is isomorphic to the Frobenius manifold attached to some Laurent polynomial. The purpose of this thesis is to generalize this result. More precisely, we show, up to a conjecture on the value of some orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants, that the Frobenius structure obtained on the orbifold quantum cohomology of the weighted projective spaces is isomorphic to the one attached to some Laurent polynomial.
