This paper concerns a super Poisson-Lie structure on the real Lie supergroup SU(m \ve n). In fact, it turns out that the realification of the complex Lie supergroup SL(m \ve n, \C) is a double of SU(m \ve n) i.e. it is endowed with a structure of super Poisson-Lie which brings down on the supergroup SU(m \ve n). We show that the dual Poisson-Lie supergroup of SU(m\ve n) is s(AN). Reciprocaly, s(AN) inherits a super Poisson-Lie structure from the realification of SL(m\ve n,\C) such that its dual Poisson-Lie supergroup is SU(m\ve n).
