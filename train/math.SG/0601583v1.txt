In this paper we introduce the notion of contact angle for an immersed surface in three dimensional sphere. We deduce formulas for the Laplacian and for the Gaussian curvature, and we classify minimal surfaces in S^3 with constant contact angle. Also, we give an example of a minimal surface in S^3 with non constant contact angle.
