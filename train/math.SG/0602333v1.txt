We introduce a surgery for generalized complex manifolds whose input is a symplectic 4-manifold containing a symplectic 2-torus with trivial normal bundle and whose output is a 4-manifold endowed with a generalized complex structure exhibiting type change along a 2-torus. Performing this surgery on a K3 surface, we obtain a generalized complex structure on 3 CP^2 # 19 \overline{CP^2}, which has vanishing Seiberg-Witten invariants and hence does not admit complex or symplectic structure.
