A class of codimension one foliations has been recently introduced by imposing a natural compatibility condition with a closed maximally non-degenerate 2-form. In this paper we study for such foliations the information captured by a Donaldson type submanifold. In particular we deduce that their leaf spaces are homeomorphic to leaf spaces of 3-dimensional taut foliations. We also introduce surgery constructions to show that this class of foliations is broad enough. Our techniques come mainly from symplectic geometry.
