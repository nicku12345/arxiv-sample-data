A complete description of the Alexander modules of knotted n-manifolds in the sphere S^{n+2}, n\geq 2, and irreducible Hurwitz curves is given. This description is applied to investigate properties of the first homology groups of cyclic coverings of the sphere S^{n+2} and the projective complex plane \mathbb C\mathbb P^2 branched respectively alone knotted n-manifolds and along irreducible Hurwitz (in particular, algebraic) curves.
