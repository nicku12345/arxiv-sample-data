Let X be any rational ruled symplectic four-manifold. Given a symplectic embedding \iota:B_{c}\into X of the standard ball of capacity c into X, consider the corresponding symplectic blow-up \tX_{\iota}. In this paper, we study the homotopy type of the symplectomorphism group \Symp(\tX_{\iota}), simplifying and extending the results of math.SG/0207096. This allows us to compute the rational homotopy groups of the space \IEmb(B_{c},X) of unparametrized symplectic embeddings of B_{c} into X. We also show that the embedding space of one ball in CP^2, and the embedding space of two disjoint balls in CP^2, if non empty, are always homotopy equivalent to the corresponding spaces of ordered configurations. Our method relies on the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves in 4-manifolds, on the theory of Gromov invariants, and on the inflation technique of Lalonde-McDuff.
