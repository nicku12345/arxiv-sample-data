We construct a desingularization of the ``main component'' \bar{\mathfrak M}_{1,k}^0(\Bbb{P}^n,d) of the moduli space \bar{\mathfrak M}_{1,k}(\Bbb{P}^n,d) of genus-one stable maps into the complex projective space \Bbb{P}^n. As a bonus, we obtain desingularizations of certain natural sheaves over \bar{\mathfrak M}_{1,k}^0(\Bbb{P}^n,d). Such desingularizations are useful for integrating natural cohomology classes on \bar{\mathfrak M}_{1,k}^0(\Bbb{P}^n,d) using localization. In turn, these classes can be used to compute the genus-one Gromov-Witten invariants of complete intersections and classical enumerative invariants of projective spaces involving genus-one curves. The desingularization of \bar{\mathfrak M}_{1,k}^0(\Bbb{P}^n,d) is obtained by sequentially blowing up \bar{\mathfrak M}_{1,k}(\Bbb{P}^n,d) along ``bad'' subvarieties. At the end of the process, we are left with a modification of the main component, which turns out to be nonsingular.
