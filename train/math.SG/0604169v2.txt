We characterize isometric actions on compact Kaehler manifolds admitting a Lagrangian orbit, describing under which condition the Lagrangian orbit is unique. We furthermore give the complete classification of simple groups acting on the complex projective space with a Lagrangian orbit, and we give the explicit list of these orbits.
