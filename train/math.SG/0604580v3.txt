We study contact structures compatible with genus one open book decompositions with one boundary component. Any monodromy for such an open book can be written as a product of Dehn twists around dual non-separating curves in the once-punctured torus. Given such a product, we supply an algorithm to determine whether the corresponding contact structure is tight or overtwisted. We rely on Ozsv{\'a}th-Szab{\'o} Heegaard Floer homology in our construction and, in particular, we completely identify the L-spaces with genus one, one boundary component, pseudo-Anosov open book decompositions. Lastly, we reveal a new infinite family of hyperbolic three-manifolds with no co-orientable taut foliations, extending the family discovered in \cite{RSS}.
