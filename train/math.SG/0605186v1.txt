In this paper we make the first steps towards developing a theory of intersections of coisotropic submanifolds, similar to that for Lagrangian submanifolds.   For coisotropic submanifolds satisfying a certain stability requirement we establish persistence of coisotropic intersections under Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, akin to the Lagrangian intersection property. To be more specific, we prove that the displacement energy of a stable coisotropic submanifold is positive, provided that the ambient symplectic manifold meets some natural conditions. We also show that a displaceable, stable, coisotropic submanifold has non-zero Liouville class. This result further underlines the analogy between displacement properties of Lagrangian and coisotropic submanifolds.
