The geometric model of the pathway linking Schlesinger and Garnier--Painlev\'e~6 systems based on an original orthonormalization of a set of elements in {sl(2,\mathbb C)} is constructed. The explicit polynomial map of the Cartesian products of n-2 quadrics (the Zariski-topology chart of the phase space of the Garnier--Painlev\'e~6 system) into the phase space of the Schlesinger system and the rational inverse to this map are presented.
