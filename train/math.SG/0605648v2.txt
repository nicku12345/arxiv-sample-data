In this paper we study Seidel's mirror map for abelian and Kummer surfaces. We find that mirror symmetry leads in a very natural way to the classical parametrization of Kummer surfaces in \P^3. Moreover, we describe a family of embeddings of a given abelian surface into noncommutative projective spaces.
