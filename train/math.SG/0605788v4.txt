We construct examples of symplectic half-flat manifolds on compact quotients of solvable Lie groups. We prove that the Calabi-Yau structures are not rigid in the class of symplectic half-flat structures. Moreover, we provide an example of a compact 6-dimensional symplectic half-flat manifold whose real part of the complex volume form is d-exact. Finally we discuss the 4-dimensional case.
