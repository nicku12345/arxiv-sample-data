The nth symmetric product of a Riemann surface carries a natural family of Kaehler forms, arising from its interpretation as a moduli space of abelian vortices. We give a new proof of a formula of Manton-Nasir for the cohomology classes of these forms. Further, we show how these ideas generalise to families of Riemann surfaces.   These results help to clarify a conjecture of D. Salamon on the relationship between Seiberg-Witten theory on 3-manifolds fibred over the circle and symplectic Floer homology.
