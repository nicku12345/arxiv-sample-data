Let X_1, X_2 be symplectic 4-manifolds containing symplectic surfaces F_1,F_2 of identical positive genus and opposite squares. Let Z denote the symplectic sum of X_1 and X_2 along the F_k. Using relative Gromov--Witten theory, we determine precisely when the symplectic 4-manifold Z is minimal (i.e., cannot be blown down); in particular, we prove that Z is minimal unless either: one of the X_k contains a (-1)-sphere disjoint from F_k; or one of the X_k admits a ruling with F_k as a section. As special cases, this proves a conjecture of Stipsicz asserting the minimality of fiber sums of Lefschetz fibrations, and implies that the non-spin examples constructed by Gompf in his study of the geography problem are minimal.
