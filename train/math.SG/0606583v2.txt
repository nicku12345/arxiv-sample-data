We introduce a new class of Poisson structures on a Riemannian manifold. A Poisson structure in this class will be called a Killing-Poisson structure. The class of Killing-Poisson structures contains the class of symplectic structures, the class of Poisson structures studied in{\it (Differential Geometry and its Applications, {\bf Vol. 20, Issue 3} (2004), 279--291)} and the class of Poisson structures induced by some infinitesimal Lie algebras actions on Riemannian manifolds. We show that some classical results on symplectic manifolds (the integrability of the Lie algebroid structure associated to a symplectic structure, the non exactness of a symplectic structure on a compact manifold) remain valid for regular Killing-Poisson structures.
