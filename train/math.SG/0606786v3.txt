Following the approach of Bryant we study the intrinsic torsion of a SU(3)-manifold deriving a number of formulae for the Ricci and the scalar curvature in terms of torsion forms. As a consequence we prove that in some special cases the Einstein condition forces the vanishing of the intrinsic torsion.
