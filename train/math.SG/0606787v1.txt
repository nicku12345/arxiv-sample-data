We study twisted Jacobi manifolds, a concept that we had introduced in a previous Note. Twisted Jacobi manifolds can be characterized using twisted Dirac-Jacobi, which are sub-bundles of Courant-Jacobi algebroids. We show that each twisted Jacobi manifold has an associated Lie algebroid with a 1-cocycle. We introduce the notion of quasi-Jacobi bialgebroid and we prove that each twisted Jacobi manifold has a quasi-Jacobi bialgebroid canonically associated. Moreover, the double of a quasi-Jacobi bialgebroid is a Courant-Jacobi algebroid. Several examples of twisted Jacobi manifolds and twisted Dirac-Jacobi structures are presented.
