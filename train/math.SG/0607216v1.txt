We consider Courant and Courant-Jacobi brackets on the stable tangent bundle TM\times\mathds{R}^h of a differentiable manifold and corresponding Dirac, Dirac-Jacobi and generalized complex structures. We prove that Dirac and Dirac-Jacobi structures on TM\times\mathds{R}^h can be prolonged to TM\times\mathds{R}^k, k>h, by means of commuting infinitesimal automorphisms. Some of the stable, generalized, complex structures are a natural generalization of the normal, almost contact structures; they are expressible by a system of tensors (P,\theta,F,Z_a,\xi^a) (a=1,...,h), where P is a bivector field, \theta is a 2-form, F is a (1,1)-tensor field, Z_a are vector fields and \xi^a are 1-forms, which satisfy conditions that generalize the conditions satisfied by a normal, almost contact structure (F,Z,\xi). We prove that such a generalized structure projects to a generalized, complex structure of a space of leaves and characterize the structure by means of the projected structure and of a normal bundle of the foliation. Like in the Boothby-Wang theorem about contact manifolds, principal torus bundles with a connection over a generalized, complex manifold provide examples of this kind of generalized, normal, almost contact structures.
