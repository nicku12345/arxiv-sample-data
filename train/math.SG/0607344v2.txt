We construct, somewhat non-standard, Legendrian surgery diagrams for some Stein fillable contact structures on some plumbing trees of circle bundles over spheres. We then show how to put such a surgery diagram on the pages of an open book for S^3, with relatively low genus. Thus we produce open books with low genus pages supporting these Stein fillable contact structures, and in many cases it can be shown that these open books have minimal genus pages.
