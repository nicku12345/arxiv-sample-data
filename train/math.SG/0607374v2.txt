We describe a stratification on the double flag variety G/B^+\times G/B^- of a complex semisimple algebraic group G analogous to the Deodhar stratification on the flag variety G/B^+, which is a refinement of the stratification into orbits both for B^+\times B^- and for the diagonal action of G, just as Deodhar's stratification refines the orbits of B^+ and B^-.   We give a coordinate system on each stratum, and show that all strata are coisotropic subvarieties. Also, we discuss possible connections to the positive and cluster geometry of G/B^+\times G/B^-, which would generalize results of Fomin and Zelevinsky on double Bruhat cells and Marsh and Rietsch on double Schubert cells.
