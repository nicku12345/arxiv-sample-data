Heegaard Floer homology, first introduced by P. Ozsvath and Z. Szabo, associates to a 3-manifold Y a family of relatively graded Abelian groups HF(Y,t), indexed by Spin^c structures t on Y. In the case that Y is a rational homology sphere, Ozsvath and Szabo lift the relative Z-grading to an absolute Q-grading. This induces a relative Q-grading on \bigoplus_{t\in Spin^c(Y)} HF(Y,t). In this paper we describe an alternate construction of this relative Q-grading by studying the Heegaard Floer homology of covering spaces.
