We use Floer cohomology to prove the monotone version of a conjecture of Audin: the minimal Maslov number of a monotone Lagrangian torus in C^n is 2. Our approach is based on the study of the quantum cup product on Floer cohomology and in particular the behaviour of Oh's spectral sequence with respect to this product. As further applications we prove existence of holomorphic disks with boundaries on Lagrangians as well as new results on Lagrangian intersections.
