Let X be a simply connected compact Riemannian symmetric space, let U be the universal covering group of the identity component of the isometry group of X, and let \g denote the complexification of the Lie algebra of U, \g=\u^\C. Each \u-compatible triangular decomposition \g=\n_- + \h + \n_+ determines a Poisson Lie group structure \pi_U on U. The Evens-Lu construction produces a (U,\pi_U)-homogeneous Poisson structure on X. By choosing the basepoint in X appropriately, X is presented as U/K where K is the fixed point set of an involution which stabilizes the triangular decomposition of \g. With this presentation, a connection is established between the symplectic foliation of the Evens-Lu Poisson structure and the Birkhoff decomposition of U/K. This is done through reinterpretation of results of Pickrell. Each symplectic leaf admits a natural torus action. It is shown that the action is Hamiltonian and the momentum map is computed using triangular factorization. Finally, local formulas for the Evens-Lu Poisson structure are displayed in several examples.
