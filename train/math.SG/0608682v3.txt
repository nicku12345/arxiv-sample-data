In this paper, we characterize unitary representations of the fundamental group of a punctured sphere whose generators can be decomposed into products of two Lagrangian involutions. Our main result is that such representations are exactly the elements of the fixed-point set of an anti-symplectic involution defined on the moduli space of unitary representations of this fundamental group. Consequently, it is a Lagrangian submanifold of this representation space.
