This paper introduces techniques of symplectic topology to the study of homoclinic orbits in Hamiltonian systems. The main result is a strong generalization of homoclinic existence results due to Sere and to Coti-Zelati, Ekeland and Sere, which were obtained by variational methods. Our existence result uses a modification of a construction due to Mohnke (originally in the context of Legendrian chords), and an energy--capacity inequality of Chekanov. In essence, we show the existence of a homoclinic orbit by showing a certain Lagrangian embedding cannot exist. We consider a (possibly time dependent) Hamiltonian system on an exact symplectic manifold (W, \omega = d \lambda) with a hyperbolic rest point. In the case of periodic time dependence, we show the existence of an orbit homoclinic to the rest point if \lambda(X_H) - H is positive and proper, H is positive outside a compact set and proper, and (W, \omega) admits the structure of a Weinstein domain. In the autonomous case, we establish the existence of an orbit homoclinic to the rest point if the critical level is of restricted contact-type, and the critical level has a Hamiltonian displaceable neighbourhood.
