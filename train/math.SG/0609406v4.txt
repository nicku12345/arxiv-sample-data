This paper is concerned with the rational symplectic field theory in the Floer case. For this observe that in the general geometric setup for symplectic field theory the contact manifolds can be replaced by mapping tori of symplectic manifolds with symplectomorphisms. While the cylindrical contact homology is given by the Floer homologies of powers of the symplectomorphism, the other algebraic invariants of symplectic field theory provide natural generalizations of symplectic Floer homology. For symplectically aspherical manifolds and Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms we study the moduli spaces of rational curves and prove a transversality result, which does not need the polyfold theory by Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder. Besides that our result shows that one does not get nontrivial operations on Floer homology from symplectic field theory, we use it to compute the full contact homology of the corresponding Hamiltonian mapping torus.
