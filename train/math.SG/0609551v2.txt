We study the spaces of locally-finite stability conditions on the derived categories of coherent sheaves on the minimal resolutions of A_n-singularities supported at the exceptional sets. Our main theorem is that they are connected and simply-connected. The proof is based on the study of spherical objects in math.AG/0409151 and the homological mirror symmetry for A_n-singularities.
