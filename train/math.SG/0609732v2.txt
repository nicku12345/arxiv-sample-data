We study a large class of Poisson manifolds, derived from Manin triples, for which we construct explicit partitions into regular Poisson submanifolds by intersecting certain group orbits. Examples include all varieties {\mathcal L} of Lagrangian subalgebras of reductive quadratic Lie algebras \d with Poisson structures defined by Lagrangian splittings of \d. In the special case of \g \oplus \g, where \g is a complex semi-simple Lie algebra, we explicitly compute the ranks of the Poisson structures on {\mathcal L} defined by arbitrary Lagrangian splittings of {\mathfrak g} \oplus {\mathfrak g}. Such Lagrangian splittings have been classified by P. Delorme, and they contain the Belavin--Drinfeld splittings as special cases.
