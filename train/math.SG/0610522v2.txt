We define integrable, big-isotropic structures on a manifold M as subbundles E\subseteq TM\oplus T^*M that are isotropic with respect to the natural, neutral metric (pairing) g of TM\oplus T^*M and are closed by Courant brackets (this also implies that [E,E^{\perp_g}]\subseteq E^{\perp_g}). We give the interpretation of such a structure by objects of M, we discuss the local geometry of the structure and we give a reduction theorem.
