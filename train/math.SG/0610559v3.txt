Link Floer homology is an invariant for links defined using a suitable version of Lagrangian Floer homology. In an earlier paper, this invariant was given a combinatorial description with mod 2 coefficients. In the present paper, we give a self-contained presentation of the basic properties of link Floer homology, including an elementary proof of its invariance. We also fix signs for the differentials, so that the theory is defined with integer coefficients.
