We prove a structure theorem for the Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Kahler surfaces with geometric genus p_g>0. Under the technical assumption that there is a canonical divisor that is a disjoint union of smooth components, the theorem shows that the GW invariants are universal functions determined by the genus of this canonical divisor components and the holomorphic Euler characteristic of the surface. We compute special cases of these universal functions.
