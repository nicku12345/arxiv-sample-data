The class of +adequate links contains both alternating and positive links. Generalizing results of Tanaka (for the positive case) and Ng (for the alternating case), we construct fronts of an arbitrary +adequate link A so that the diagram has a ruling, therefore its Thurston-Bennequin number is maximal among Legendrian representatives of A. We derive consequences for the Kauffman polynomial and Khovanov homology of +adequate links.
