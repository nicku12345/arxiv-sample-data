This article is a revised, short and english version of my PhD thesis. First, we show a mirror theorem : the Frobenius manifold associated to the orbifold quantum cohomology of weighted projective space is isomorphic to the one attached to a specific Laurent polynomial. Secondly, we show a reconstruction theorem, that is, we can reconstruct in an algorithmic way the full genus 0 Gromov-Witten potential from the 3-point invariants.
