Lisa Traynor has described an example of a two-component Legendrian `circular helix link' in the 1-jet space of the circle (with its canonical contact structure) that is topologically but not Legendrian isotopic to that same link with the order of the two components reversed. We give a complete classification of the Legendrian realisations of this topological link type, as well as all other `cable links' in that 1-jet space.
