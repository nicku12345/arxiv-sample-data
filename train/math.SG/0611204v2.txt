We compute the Lagrangian Floer cohomology groups of certain tori in closed simply connected symplectic 4-manifolds arising from Fintushel-Stern knot surgery. These manifolds are usually not symplectically aspherical. As a result of the computation we observe examples where HF(L_0)\cong HF(L_1) and L_0 and L_1 are smoothly isotopic but L_0,L_1 are not symplectically isotopic and are distinguished by HF(L_0,L_1).
