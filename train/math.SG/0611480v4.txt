We consider existence and uniqueness of two kinds of coisotropic embeddings and deduce the existence of deformation quantizations of certain Poisson algebras of basic functions. First we show that any submanifold of a Poisson manifold satisfying a certain constant rank condition sits coisotropically inside some larger cosymplectic submanifold, which is naturally endowed with a Poisson structure. Then we give conditions under which a Dirac manifold can be embedded coisotropically in a Poisson manifold, extending a classical theorem of Gotay.
