In a compact, symplectic real manifold, i.e supporting an antisymplectic involution, we use Donaldson's construction to build a codimension 2 symplectic submanifold invariant under the action of the involution. If the real part of the manifold is not empty, and if the symplectic form \om is entire, then for all k big enough, we can find a hypersurface Poincar\'e dual of k[\omega] such that its real part has at least k^{\dim X/4} connected components, up to a constant independant of k. Finally we extend to our real case Donaldson's construction of Lefschetz pencils.
