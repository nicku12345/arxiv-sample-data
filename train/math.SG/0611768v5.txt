The (local) invariant symplectic action functional \A is associated to a Hamiltonian action of a compact connected Lie group \G on a symplectic manifold (M,\omega), endowed with a \G-invariant Riemannian metric <\cdot,\cdot>_M. It is defined on the set of pairs of loops (x,\xi):S^1\to M\x\Lie\G for which x satisfies some admissibility condition. I prove a sharp isoperimetric inequality for \A if <\cdot,\cdot>_M is induced by some \omega-compatible and \G-invariant almost complex structure J, and, as an application, an optimal result about the decay at \infty of symplectic vortices on the half-cylinder [0,\infty)\x S^1.
