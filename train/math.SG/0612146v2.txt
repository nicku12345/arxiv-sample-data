We study quasi-Jacobi and Jacobi-quasi bialgebroids and their relationships with twisted Jacobi and quasi Jacobi manifolds. We show that we can construct quasi-Lie bialgebroids from quasi-Jacobi bialgebroids, and conversely, and also that the structures induced on their base manifolds are related via a quasi Poissonization.
