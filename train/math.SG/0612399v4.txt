Let X be a real analytic manifold, and let T^*X be its cotangent bundle. In a recent paper with E. Zaslow \cite{NZ}, we showed that the dg category Sh_c(X) of constructible sheaves on X quasi-embeds into the triangulated envelope F(T^*X) of the Fukaya category of T^*X. We prove here that the quasi-embedding is in fact a quasi-equivalence. When X is complex, one may interpret this as a topological analogue of the identification of Lagrangian branes in T^*X and holonomic D_X-modules developed by Kapustin and Kapustin-Witten from a physical perspective.   As a concrete application, we show that compact connected exact Lagrangians in T^*X (with some modest homological assumptions) are equivalent in the Fukaya category to the zero section. In particular, this determines their (complex) cohomology ring and homology class in T^*X, and provides a homological bound on their number of intersection points. An independent characterization of compact branes in T^*X has recently been obtained by Fukaya-Seidel-Smith.
