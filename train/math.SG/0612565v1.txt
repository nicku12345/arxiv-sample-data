We prove that the group of Hamiltonian automorphisms of a symplectic 4-manifold contains only finitely many conjugacy classes of maximal compact tori with respect to the action of the full symplectomorphism group. We also extend to rational and ruled manifolds a result of Kedra which asserts that, if M is a simply connected symplectic 4-manifold with b_{2}\geq 3, and if \widetilde{M}_{\delta} denotes a blow-up of M of small enough capacity \delta, then the rational cohomology algebra of the Hamiltonian group of \widetilde{M}_{\delta}) is not finitely generated. Both results are based on the fact that in a symplectic 4-manifold endowed with any tamed almost structure J, exceptional classes of minimal symplectic area are J-indecomposable. Some applications and examples are given.
