In this note we show that +1-contact surgery on distinct Legendrian knots frequently produces contactomorphic manifolds. We also give examples where this happens for -1-contact surgery. As an amusing corollary we find overtwisted contact structures that contain a large number of distinct Legendrian knots with the same classical invariants and tight complements.
