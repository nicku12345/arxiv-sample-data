We show how to construct broken, achiral Lefschetz fibrations on arbitrary smooth, closed, oriented 4-manifolds. These are generalizations of Lefschetz fibrations over the 2-sphere, where we allow Lefschetz singularities with the non-standard orientation as well as circles of singularities corresponding to round 1-handles. We can also arrange that a given surface of square 0 is a fiber. The construction is easier and more explicit in the case of doubles of 4-manifolds without 3- and 4-handles, such as the homotopy 4-spheres arising from nontrivial balanced presentations of the trivial group.
