We explore the relationship between contact forms on \mathbb S^3 defined by Finsler metrics on \mathbb S^2 and the theory developed by H. Hofer, K. Wysocki and E. Zehnder in \cite{HWZ,HWZ1}. We show that a Finsler metric on \mathbb S^2 with curvature K\geq 1 and with all geodesic loops of length >\pi is dynamically convex and hence it has either two or infinitely many closed geodesics. We also explain how to explicitly construct J-holomorphic embeddings of cylinders asymptotic to Reeb orbits of contact structures arising from Finsler metrics on \mathbb S^2 with K=1 thus complementing the results obtained in \cite{HW}.
