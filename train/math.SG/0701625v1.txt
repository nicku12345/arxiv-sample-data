The present paper explores how the spectral sequence introduced in a previous work (and obtained by taking moduli spaces of any dimension into account in the Floer construction), interacts with the presence of bubbling. As consequences are obtained some relations between binary Gromov-Witten invariants and relative Ganea-Hopf invariants, a criterion for detecting the monodromy of bubbling as well as algebraic criteria for the detection of periodic orbits.
