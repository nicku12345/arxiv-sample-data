Let M be \CP#2\CPb, 3\CP#4\CPb or (2n-1)\CP#2n\CPb for any integer n\geq 3.   We construct an irreducible symplectic 4-manifold homeomorphic to M and also an infinite family of pairwise non-diffeomorphic irreducible non-symplectic 4-manifolds homeomorphic to M. We also construct such exotic smooth structures when M is \CP#4\CPb or 3\CP# k \CPb for k=6,8,10.
