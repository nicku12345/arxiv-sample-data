We construct embeddings \mathcal{Y}_{n,\tau} \to {Hilb}^n (\Sigma_{\tau}) for each of the classical Lie algebras \ger{sp}_{2m}(\Cc), \ger{so}_{2m}(\Cc), and \ger{so}_{2m+1}(\Cc). The space \mathcal{Y}_{n,\tau} is the fiber over a point \tau \in \ger h / W of the restriction of the adjoint quotient map \chi : \ger g \to \ger h /W to a suitably chosen transverse slice of a nilpotent orbit. These embeddings were discovered for \ger{sl}_{2m}(\Cc) by Ciprian Manolescu. They are related to the symplectic link homology of Seidel and Smith.
