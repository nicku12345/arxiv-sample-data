We develop a theory of reduction for generalized Kahler and hyper-Kahler structures which uses the generalized Riemannian metric in an essential way, and which is not described with reference solely to a single generalized complex structure. We show that our construction specializes to the usual theory of Kahler and hyper-Kahler reduction, and it gives a way to view usual hyper-Kahler quotients in terms of generalized Kahler reduction.
