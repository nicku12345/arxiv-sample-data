We use the global stochastic analysis tools introduced by P. A. Meyer and L. Schwartz to write down a stochastic generalization of the Hamilton equations on a Poisson manifold that, for exact symplectic manifolds, are characterized by a natural critical action principle similar to the one encountered in classical mechanics. Several features and examples in relation with the solution semimartingales of these equations are presented.
