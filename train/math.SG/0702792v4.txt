The space \Omega(G) of all based loops in a compact semisimple simply connected Lie group G has an action of the maximal torus T\subset G (by pointwise conjugation) and of the circle S^1 (by rotation of loops). Let \mu : \Omega(G)\to (\t\times i\mathbb{R})^* be a moment map of the resulting T\times S^1 action. We show that all levels (that is, pre-images of points) of \mu are connected subspaces of \Omega(G) (or empty). The result holds if in the definition of \Omega(G) loops are of class C^{\infty} or of any Sobolev class H^s, with s\ge 1 (for loops of class H^1, connectedness of regular levels has been proved by Harada, Holm, Jeffrey, and the author).
