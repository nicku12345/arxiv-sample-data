We review Bennequin type inequalities established using various versions of the Khovanov-Rozansky cohomology. Then we give a new proof of a Bennequin type inequality established by the author, and derive new Bennequin type inequalities for knots using Gornik's version of the Khovanov-Rozansky cohomology, which generalize those established by Shumakovitch, Plamenevskaya and Kawamura using the Rasmussen invariant.
