Let G be a Poisson Lie group and \g its Lie bialgebra. Suppose that \g is a group Lie bialgebra. This means that there is an action of a discrete group \Gamma on G deforming the Poisson structure into coboundary equivalent ones. Starting from this we construct a non-trivial stack of Hopf-Poisson algebras and prove the existence of associated deformation quantizations. This non-trivial stack is a stack of functions on the formal Poisson group, dual of the starting \Gamma Poisson-Lie group. To quantize this non-trivial stack we use quantization of a \Gamma Lie bialgebra which is the infinitesimal of a \Gamma Poisson-Lie group (cf \cite{MS} for simple Lie groups and \Gamma a covering of the Weyl group and \cite{EH} for quantization in the general case).
