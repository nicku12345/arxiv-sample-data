We prove a compactness theorem for holomorphic curves in 4-dimensional symplectizations that have embedded projections to the underlying 3-manifold. It strengthens the cylindrical case of the SFT compactness theorem by using intersection theory to show that degenerations of such sequences never give rise to multiple covers or nodes, so transversality is easily achieved. This has application to the theory of stable finite energy foliations, and also suggests a new approach to defining SFT-type invariants for contact 3-manifolds, or more generally, 3-manifolds with stable Hamiltonian structures.
