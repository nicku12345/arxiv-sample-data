Motivated by mirror symmetry, we consider a Lagrangian fibration X\to B and Lagrangian maps f:L\hookrightarrow X\to B, when L has dimension 2, exhibiting an unstable singularity, and study how their caustic changes, in a neighbourhood of the unstable singularity, when slightly perturbed. The integral curves of \nabla f_x, for x\in B, where f_x(y)=f(y)-x\cdot y, called ``gradient lines'', are then introduced, and a study of them, in order to analyse their bifurcation locus, is carried out.
