We compute the homotopy type of the space of T^n-equivariant symplectic embeddings from the standard 2n-dimensional ball of some fixed radius into a 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifold M, and use this computation to define a Z-valued step function on the positive real line which is an invariant of the symplectic-toric type of M. We conclude with a discussion of the partially equivariant case of this result.
