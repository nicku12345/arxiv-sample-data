For each pair (e,\sigma) of integers satisfying 2e+3\sigma\ge 0, \sigma\leq -2, and e+\sigma\equiv 0\pmod{4}, with four exceptions, we construct a minimal, simply connected symplectic 4-manifold with Euler characteristic e and signature \sigma. We also produce simply connected, minimal symplectic 4-manifolds with signature zero (resp. signature -1) with Euler characteristic 4k (resp. 4k+1) for all k\ge 46 (resp. k\ge 49).
