In this paper we compute certain two-point integrals over a moduli space of stable maps into projective space. Computation of one-point analogues of these integrals constitutes a proof of mirror symmetry for genus-zero one-point Gromov-Witten invariants of projective hypersurfaces. The integrals computed in this paper constitute a significant portion in the proof of mirror symmetry for genus-one GW-invariants completed in a separate paper. These integrals also provide explicit mirror formulas for genus-zero two-point GW-invariants of projective hypersurfaces. The approach described in this paper leads to a reconstruction algorithm for all genus-zero GW-invariants of projective hypersurfaces.
