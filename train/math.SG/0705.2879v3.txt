It does not seem to have been observed previously that the classical Bernstein polynomials B_N(f)(x) are closely related to the Bergman-Szego kernels \Pi_N for the Fubini-Study metric on \CP^1: B_N(f)(x) is the Berezin symbol of the Toeplitz operator \Pi_N f(N^{-1} D_{\theta}). The relation suggests a generalization of Bernstein polynomials to any toric Kahler variety and Delzant polytope P. When f is smooth, B_N(f)(x) admits a complete asymptotic expansion. Integrating it over P gives a complete asymptotic expansion for Dedekind-Riemann sums of smooth functions over lattice points in N P related to Euler-MacLaurin sum formulae of Guillemin-Sternberg and others.
