Let M be a compact symplectic manifold, and L be a closed Lagrangian submanifold which can be lifted to a Legendrian submanifold in the contactization of M. For any Legendrian deformation of L satisfying some given conditions, we get a new Lagrangian submanifold L'. We prove that the number of intersection of L and L' can be estimated from below by the sum of Z_2-Betti numbers of L, provided they intersect transversally.
