A Hamiltonian action of a complex torus on a symplectic complex manifold is said to be {\it multiplicity free} if a general orbit is a lagrangian submanifold. To any multiplicity free Hamiltonian action of a complex torus T\cong (\C^\times)^n on a Stein manifold X we assign a certain 5-tuple consisting of a Stein manifold Y, an \'{e}tale map Y\to \t^*, a set of divisors on Y and elements of H^2(Y,\Z)^{\oplus n}, H^2(Y,\C). We show that X is uniquely determined by this invariants. Furthermore, we describe all 5-tuples arising in this way.
