The main result of this note is that every closed Hamiltonian S^1 manifold is uniruled, i.e. it has a nonzero Gromov--Witten invariant one of whose constraints is a point. The proof uses the Seidel representation of \pi_1 of the Hamiltonian group in the small quantum homology of M as well as the blow up technique recently introduced by Hu, Li and Ruan. It applies more generally to manifolds that have a loop of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms with a nondegenerate fixed maximum. Some consequences for Hofer geometry are explored. An appendix discusses the structure of the quantum homology ring of uniruled manifolds.
