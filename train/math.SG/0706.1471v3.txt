Let M be a connected compact quantizable K\"ahler manifold equipped with a Hamiltonian action of a connected compact Lie group G. Let M//G=\phi^{-1}(0)/G=M_0 be the symplectic quotient at value 0 of the moment map \phi. The space M_0 may in general not be smooth. It is known that, as vector spaces, there is a natural isomorphism between the quantum Hilbert space over M_0 and the G-invariant subspace of the quantum Hilbert space over M. In this paper, without any regularity assumption on the quotient M_0, we discuss the relation between the inner products of these two quantum Hilbert spaces under the above natural isomorphism; we establish asymptotic unitarity to leading order in Planck's constant of a modified map of the above isomorphism under a ``metaplectic correction'' of the two quantum Hilbert spaces.
