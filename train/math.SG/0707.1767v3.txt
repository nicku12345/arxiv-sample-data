This article determines the spectral data, in the integrable systems sense, for all weakly conformally immersed Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian in \R^4. This enables us to describe their moduli space and the locus of branch points of such an immersion. This is also an informative example in integrable systems geometry, since the group of ambient isometries acts non-trivially on the spectral data and the relevant energy functional (the area) need not be constant under deformations by higher flows.
