We define the notions of S_t^1\times S_s^1-valued lightcone Gauss maps, lightcone pedal surface and Lorentzian lightcone height function of Lorentzian surface in semi-Euclidean 4-space and established the relationships between singularities of these objects and geometric invariants of the surface as applications of standard techniques of singularity theory for the Lorentzian lightcone height function.
