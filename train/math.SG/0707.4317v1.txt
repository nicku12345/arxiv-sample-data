This paper follows a previous one in which were introduced deformation invariants \chi^d_r, d \in H_2 (X ; \Z), r \in \N, of closed real symplectic four-manifolds (X, \omega, c_X), invariants which produced lower bounds in real enumerative geometry. We prove here using methods of symplectic field theory that the lower bounds are sharp when r \leq 1 and the real locus of the manifold contains a sphere, torus or real projective plane (under stronger assumptions in this last case). We also prove that a big power of two divides \chi^d_r as soon as r is not too big and when the real locus contains a sphere or real projective plane (under the same stronger assumptions in this last case). We finally present some explicit computations in the case of the projective plane or quadric ellipsoid surface as well as the general formulas used to get them, formulas which involve some relative invariants that we first define.
