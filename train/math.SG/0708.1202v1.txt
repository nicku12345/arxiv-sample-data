This paper defines a symplectic form on the infinite dimensional Fr\'echet manifold of framed curves of fixed length over a simply connected Riemannian manifold of constant curvature. The paper then considers Hamiltonian systems generated by the geometric invariants of the curves on the base manifold and relates them to the equations of mathematical physics.
