Let (M,\omega) be a compact symplectic manifold, and \phi be a symplectic diffeomorphism on M, we define a Floer-type homology FH_*(\phi) which is a gen- eralization of Floer homology for symplectic fixed points defined by Dostoglou and Salamon for monotone symplectic manifolds. These homology groups are modules over a suitable Novikov ring and depend only on \phi up to a Hamiltonian isotopy.
