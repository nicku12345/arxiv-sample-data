We show that Chen-Ruan cohomology is a homotopy invariant in certain cases. We introduce the notion of a T-representation homotopy, which is a stringent form of homotopy under which Chen-Ruan cohomology is invariant. We show that while hyperkahler quotients of the cotangent bundle to a complex vector space by a circle S^1 (here termed weighted hyperprojective spaces) are homotopy equivalent to weighted projective spaces, they are not S^1-representation homotopic. Indeed, we show that their Chen-Ruan cohomology rings (over the rationals) are distinct.
