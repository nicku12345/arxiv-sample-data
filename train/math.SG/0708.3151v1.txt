I.A.B. Strachan introduced the notion of a natural Frobenius submanifold of a Frobenius manifold and gave a sufficient but not necessary condition for a submanifold to be a natural Frobenius submanifold. This paper will give a necessary and sufficient condition and classify the natural Frobenius hypersurfaces.
