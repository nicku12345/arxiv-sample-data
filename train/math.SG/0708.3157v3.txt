This paper studies smooth obstructions to integrability and proves two main results. First, it is shown that if a smooth topological n-torus admits a real-analytically completely integrable convex hamiltonian on its cotangent bundle, then the torus is diffeomorphic to the standard n-torus. This is the first known result where the smooth structure of a manifold obstructs complete integrability. Second, it is proven that each one of the Witten-Kreck-Stolz 7-manifolds admit a real-analytically completely integrable geodesic flow on its cotangent bundle. This gives examples of topological manifolds all of whose smooth structures admit a real-analytically completely integrable convex hamiltonian on its cotangent bundle. Additional examples are provided by Eschenburgh and Aloff-Wallach spaces.
