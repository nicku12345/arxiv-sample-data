We study Hamiltonian actions of compact Lie groups K on Kaehler manifolds which extend to a holomorphic action of the complexified group K^C. For a closed normal subgroup L of K we show that the Kaehlerian reduction with respect to L is a stratified Hamiltonian Kaehler K^C/L^C-space whose Kaehlerian reduction with respect to K/L is naturally isomorphic to the Kaehlerian reduction of the original manifold with respect to K.
