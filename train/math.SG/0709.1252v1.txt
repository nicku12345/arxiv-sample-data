In this survey article we describe the geometry of toric hyperk\"ahler varieties, which are hyperk\"ahler quotients of the quaternionic vector spaces by tori. In particular, we discuss the Betti numbers, the cohomology ring, and variation of hyperk\"ahler structures of these spaces with many improved results and proofs.
