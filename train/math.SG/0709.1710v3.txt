Smooth and symplectic symmetries of an infinite family of distinct exotic K3 surfaces are studied, and comparison with the corresponding symmetries of the standard K3 is made. The action on the K3 lattice induced by a smooth finite group action is shown to be strongly restricted, and as a result, nonsmoothability of actions induced by a holomorphic automorphism of a prime order \geq 7 is proved and nonexistence of smooth actions by several K3 groups is established (included among which is the binary tetrahedral group T_{24} which has the smallest order). Concerning symplectic symmetries, the fixed-point set structure of a symplectic cyclic action of a prime order \geq 5 is explicitly determined, provided that the action is homologically nontrivial.
