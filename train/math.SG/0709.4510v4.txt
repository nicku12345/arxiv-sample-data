Given a closed monotone symplectic manifold M, we define certain characteristic cohomology classes of the free loop space L \text {Ham}(M, \omega) with values in QH_* (M), and their S^1 equivariant version. These classes generalize the Seidel representation and satisfy versions of the axioms for Chern classes. In particular there is a Whitney sum formula, which gives rise to a graded ring homomorphism from the ring H_{*} (L\text {Ham}(M, \omega), \mathbb{Q}), with its Pontryagin product to QH_{2n+*} (M) with its quantum product. As an application we prove an extension of a theorem of McDuff and Slimowitz on minimality in the Hofer metric of a semifree Hamiltonian circle action, to higher dimensional geometry of the loop space L \text {Ham}(M, \omega).
