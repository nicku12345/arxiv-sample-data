We give topological obstructions to the existence of a closed exact Lagrangian submanifold in the cotangent bundle of a closed manifold M which is the total space of a fibration over the circle. For instance we show that the fundamental group of such a Lagrangian submanifold cannot be the free product of two non-trivial groups and that in any finite presentation of this group the difference between the number of generators and the number of relations is less than two.
