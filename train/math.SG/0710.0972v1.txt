In this paper we construct the Floer homology for an action functional which was introduced by Rabinowitz and prove a vanishing theorem. As an application, we show that there are no displaceable exact contact embeddings of the unit cotangent bundle of a sphere of dimension greater than three into a convex exact symplectic manifold with vanishing first Chern class. This generalizes Gromov's result that there are no exact Lagrangian embeddings of a sphere into a complex vector space.
