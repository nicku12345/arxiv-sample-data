We introduce the notion of a local torus action modeled on the standard representation (for simplicity, we call it a local torus action). It is a generalization of a locally standard torus action and also an underlying structure of a locally toric Lagrangian fibration. For a local torus action, we define two invariants called a characteristic pair and an Euler class of the orbit map, and prove that local torus actions are classified topologically by them. As a corollary, we obtain a topological classification of locally standard torus actions, which is a generalization of the topological classification of quasi-toric manifolds by Davis and Januszkiewicz and of effective two-dimensional torus actions on four-dimensional manifolds without nontrivial finite stabilizers by Orlik and Raymond. We investigate locally toric Lagrangian fibrations from the viewpoint of local torus actions. We give a necessary and sufficient condition in order that a local torus action becomes a locally toric Lagrangian fibration. Locally toric Lagrangian fibrations are classified by Boucetta and Molino up to fiber-preserving symplectomorphisms. We shall reprove the classification theorem of locally toric Lagrangian fibrations by refining the proof of the classification theorem of local torus actions. We also investigate the topology of a manifold equipped with a local torus action when the Euler class of the orbit map vanishes.
