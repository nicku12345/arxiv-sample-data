The purpose of this paper is to construct new examples of group-valued moment maps. As the main tool for construction of such examples we use quasi-symplectic implosion which was introduced in [HJS06]. More precisely we show that there are certain strata of D{\bf Sp}(n)_{\rm impl}, the universal imploded space, where it is singular but whose closure is a smooth quasi-Hamiltonian {\bf Sp}(n) \times T space.
