In this paper we study Poisson actions of complete Poisson groups, without any connectivity assumption or requiring the existence of a momentum map. For any complete Poisson group G with dual G^\star we obtain a suitably connected integrating symplectic double groupoid \calS. As a consequence, the cotangent lift of a Poisson action on an integrable Poisson manifold P can be integrated to a Poisson action of the symplectic groupoid \poidd{\calS}{G^\star} on the symplectic groupoid for P. Finally, we show that the quotient Poisson manifold P/G is also integrable, giving an explicit construction of a symplectic groupoid for it, by a reduction procedure on an associated morphism of double Lie groupoids.
