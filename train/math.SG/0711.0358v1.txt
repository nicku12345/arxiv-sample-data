Let M be a quantizable symplectic manifold acted on by T=(S^1)^r in a Hamiltonian fashion and J a moment map for this action. Suppose that the set M^{T} of fixed points is discrete and denote by {\alpha}_{pj}\in{\mathbb Z}^r the weights of the isotropy representation at p. By means of the \alpha_{pj}'s we define a partition {\mathcal Q}_+, {\mathcal Q}_- of M^T. (When r=1, {\mathcal Q}_{\pm} will be the set of fixed points such that the half of the Morse index of J at them is even (odd)). We prove the existence of a map \pi_{\pm}:{\mathcal Q}_{\pm}\to{\mathcal Q}_{\mp} such that J(q)-J(\pi_{\pm}(q))\in I_{\mp}, for all q\in {\mathcal Q}_{\pm}, where I_{\pm} is the lattice generated by the \alpha_{pj}'s with p\in{\mathcal Q}_{\pm}. We define partition functions N_p similar to the ones of Kostant \cite{Gui} and we prove that \sum_{p\in{\mathcal Q}_+}N_p(l)=\sum_{p\in{\mathcal Q}_-}N_p(l), for any l\in{\mathbb Z}^r with |l| sufficiently large.
