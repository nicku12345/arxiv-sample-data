Using a "Hodge decomposition" of symplectic isotopies on a compact symplectic manifold (M,\omega), we construct a norm on the identity component in the group of all symplectic diffeomorphisms of (M,\omega) whose restriction to the group Ham(M,\omega) of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms is bounded from above by the Hofer norm. Moreover, Ham(M,\omega) is closed in Symp(M,\omega) equipped with the topology induced by the extended norm. We give an application to the C^0 symplectic topology. We also discuss extensions of Oh's spectral distance.
