We establish the Schwarz Reflection Principle for J-complex discs attached to a real analytic J-totally real submanifold of an almost complex manifold with real analytic J. We also prove the precise boundary regularity and derive the precise convergence in Gromov compactness theorem in \calc^{k,\alpha}-classes.
