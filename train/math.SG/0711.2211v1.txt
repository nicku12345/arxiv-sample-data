Let M be a K\"ahler surface and \Sigma be a closed symplectic surface which is smoothly immersed in M. Let \alpha be the K\"ahler angle of \Sigma in M. We first deduce the Euler-Lagrange equation of the functional L=\int_{\Sigma}\frac{1}{\cos\alpha}d\mu in the class of symplectic surfaces. It is \cos^3\alpha H=(J(J\nabla\cos\alpha)^\top)^\bot, where H is the mean curvature vector of \Sigma in M, J is the complex structure compatible with the K\"ahler form \omega in M, which is an elliptic equation. We then study the properties of the equation.
