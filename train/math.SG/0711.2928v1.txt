We consider circle bundles over compact three-manifolds with symplectic total spaces. We show that the base of such a space must be irreducible or the product of the two-sphere with the circle. We then deduce that such a bundle admits a symplectic form if and only if it admits one that is invariant under the circle action in three special cases: namely if the base is Seifert fibered, has vanishing Thurston norm, or if the total space admits a Lefschetz fibration.
