Ricci-type symplectic manifolds have been introduced and extensively studied by M. Cahen et al.. In this note, we describe their deformation quantizations in the split solvable symmetric case. In particular, we introduce the notion of non-formal tempered deformation quantization on such a space. We show that the set of tempered deformation quantizations is in one-to-one correspondence with the space of Schwartz operator multipliers on the real line. Moreover we prove that every invariant formal star product on a split Ricci-type solvable symmetric space is an asymptotic expansion of a tempered non-formal quantization. This note illustrates and partially reviews through an example a problematic studied by the author regarding non-formal quantization in presence of large groups of symmetries.
