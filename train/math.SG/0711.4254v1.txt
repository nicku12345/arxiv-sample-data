This is a paper devoted to the symplectic birational geometry program where many basic notions are defined in terms of genus 0 GW invariants. We show that the existence of a positive uniruled symplectic divisor often implies that the ambient manifold has a nonzero uniruled genus 0 GW invariant, hence is uniruled as well. This confirms a part of the dichotomy on uniruled symplectic divisors. In addition, it gives a rather general construction of uniruled symplectic manifolds, generalizing some beautiful results of McDuff.
