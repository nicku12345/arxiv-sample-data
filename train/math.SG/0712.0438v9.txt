Let X be a compact Kaehler manifold of complex dimension n. Let G be a connected solvable subgroup of the automorphism group Aut(X), and let N(G) be the normal subgroup of G of elements of null entropy. One of the goals of this paper is to show that G/N(G) is a free abelian group of rank r(G) less than or equal to n-1 and that the rank estimate is optimal. This gives an alternative proof of the conjecture of Tits type. In addition, we show some non-obvious implications on the structure of solvable automorphism groups of compact Kaehler manifolds. Furthermore, we also show that if the rank r(G) of the quotient group G/N(G) is equal to n-1 and the identity component Aut_0(X) of Aut(X) is trivial, then N(G) is a finite set. The main strategy of this paper is to combine the method of Dinh and Sibony and the theorem of Birkhoff-Perron-Frobenius (or Lie-Kolchin type), and one argument of D.-Q. Zhang originated from the paper of Dinh and Sibony plays an important role.
