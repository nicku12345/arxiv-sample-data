Given an elliptic action of a compact Lie group G on a co-oriented contact manifold (M,E) one obtains two naturally associated objects: A G-transversally elliptic operator \dirac, and an equivariant differential form with generalised coefficients \mathcal{J}(E,X) defined in terms of a choice of contact form on M. We explain how the form \mathcal{J}(E,X) is natural with respect to the contact structure, and give a formula for the equivariant index of \dirac involving \mathcal{J}(E,X). A key tool is the Chern character with compact support developed by Paradan-Vergne \cite{PV1,PV}.
