Let G be a compact Lie group and LG its associated loop group. The main result of this manuscript is a surjectivity theorem from the equivariant K-theory of a Hamiltonian LG-space onto the integral K-theory of its Hamiltonian LG-quotient. Our result is a K-theoretic analogue of previous work in rational Borel-equivariant cohomology of Bott, Tolman, and Weitsman. Our proof techniques differ from that of Bott, Tolman, and Weitsman in that they explicitly use the Borel construction, which we do not have at our disposal in equivariant K-theory; we instead directly construct G-equivariant homotopy equivalences to obtain the necessary isomorphisms in equivariant K-theory. The main theorem should also be viewed as a first step toward a similar theorem in K-theory for quasi-Hamiltonian G-spaces and their associated quasi-Hamiltonian quotients.
