We introduce a notion of positive pair of contact structures on a 3-manifold which generalizes a previous definition of Eliashberg-Thurston and Mitsumatsu. Such a pair gives rise to a locally integrable plane field \lambda. We prove that if \lambda is uniquely integrable and if both structures of the pair are tight, then the integral foliation of \lambda doesn't contain any Reeb component whose core curve is homologous to zero. Moreover, the ambient manifold carries a Reebless foliation. We also show a stability theorem "\`a la Reeb" for positive pairs of tight contact structures.
