We prove that every closed oriented smooth 4-manifold X admits a broken Lefschetz fibration (aka singular Lefschetz fibration) over the 2-sphere. Given any closed orientable surface F of square zero in X, we can choose the fibration so that F is a fiber. Moreover, we can arrange it so that there is only one Lefschetz critical point when the Euler characteristic e(X) is odd, and none when e(X) is even. We make use of topological modifications of smooth maps with fold and cusp singularities due to Saeki and Levine, and thus we get alternative proofs of previous existence results. Also shown is the existence of broken Lefschetz pencils with connected fibers on any near-symplectic 4-manifold.
