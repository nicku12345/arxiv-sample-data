A n-dimensional Lie group G equipped with a left invariant symplectic form \om^+ is called a symplectic Lie group. It is well-known that \om^+ induces a left invariant affine structure on G. Relatively to this affine structure we show that the left invariant Poisson tensor \pi^+ corresponding to \om^+ is polynomial of degree 1 and any right invariant k-multivector field on G is polynomial of degree at most k. If G is unimodular, the symplectic form \om^+ is also polynomial and the volume form \wedge^{\frac{n}2}\om^+ is parallel. We show also that any left invariant tensor field on a nilpotent symplectic Lie group is polynomial, in particular, any left invariant Poisson structure on a nilpotent symplectic Lie group is polynomial. Because many symplectic Lie groups admit uniform lattices, we get a large class of polynomial Poisson structures on compact affine solvmanifolds.
