Recently, Honda, Kazez and Matic described an adapted partial open book of a compact contact 3-manifold with convex boundary by generalizing the work of Giroux in the closed case. They also implicitly established a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of partial open book decompositions modulo positive stabilization and isomorphism classes of compact contact 3-manifolds with convex boundary. In this expository article we explicate the relative version of Giroux correspondence.
