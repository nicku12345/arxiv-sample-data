We characterize quasi K\"ahler manifolds whose curvature tensor associated to the canonical Hermitian connection satisfies the first Bianchi identity. This condition is related with the third Gray identity and in the almost K\"ahler case implies the integrability. Our main tool is the existence of generalized holomorphic frames introduced by the second author previously. By using such frames we also give a simpler and shorter proof of a Theorem of Goldberg. Furthermore we study almost Hermitian structures having the curvature tensor associated to the canonical Hermitian connection equal to zero. We show some explicit examples of quasi K\"ahler structures on the Iwasawa manifold having the Hermitian curvature vanishing and the Riemann curvature tensor satisfying the second Gray identity.
