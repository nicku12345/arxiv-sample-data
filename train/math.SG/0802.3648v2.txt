Given an SO(3)-bundle with connection, the associated two-sphere bundle carries a natural closed 2-form. Asking that this be symplectic gives a curvature inequality first considered by Reznikov. We study this inequality in the case when the base has dimension four, with three main aims. Firstly, we use this approach to construct symplectic six-manifolds with c_1=0 which are never Kahler; e.g., we produce such manifolds with b_1=0=b_3 and also with c_2.omega <0, answering questions posed by Smith-Thomas-Yau. Examples come from Riemannian geometry, via the Levi-Civita connection on Lambda^+. The underlying six-manifold is then the twistor space and often the symplectic structure tames the Eells-Salamon twistor almost complex structure. Our second aim is to exploit this to deduce new results about minimal surfaces: if a certain curvature inequality holds, it follows that the space of minimal surfaces (with fixed topological invariants) is compactifiable; the minimal surfaces must also satisfy an adjunction inequality, unifying and generalising results of Chen--Tian. One metric satisfying the curvature inequality is hyperbolic four-space H^4. Our final aim is to show that the corresponding symplectic manifold is symplectomorphic to the small resolution of the conifold xw-yz=0 in C^4. We explain how this fits into a hyperbolic description of the conifold transition, with isometries of H^4 acting symplectomorphically on the resolution and isometries of H^3 acting biholomorphically on the smoothing.
