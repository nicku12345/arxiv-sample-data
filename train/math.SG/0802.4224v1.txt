Given an arbitrary sheaf \mathcal{E} of \mathcal{A}-modules (or \mathcal{A}-module in short) on a topological space X, we define \textit{annihilator sheaves} of sub-\mathcal{A}-modules of \mathcal{E} in a way similar to the classical case, and obtain thereafter the analog of the \textit{main theorem}, regarding classical annihilators in module theory, see Curtis[\cite{curtis}, pp. 240-242]. The familiar classical properties, satisfied by annihilator sheaves, allow us to set clearly the \textit{sheaf-theoretic version} of \textit{symplectic reduction}, which is the main goal in this paper.
