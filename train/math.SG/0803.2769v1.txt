In the first section of this note we show that the Theorem 1.8.1 of Bayer--Manin ([BaMa]) can be strengthened in the following way: {\it if the even quantum cohomology of a projective algebraic manifold V is generically semi--simple, then V has no odd cohomology and is of Hodge--Tate type.} In particular, this addressess a question in [Ci].   In the second section, we prove that {\it an analytic (or formal) supermanifold M with a given supercommutative associative \Cal{O}_M--bilinear multiplication on its tangent sheaf \Cal{T}_M is an F--manifold in the sense of [HeMa], iff its spectral cover as an analytic subspace of the cotangent bundle T^*_M is coisotropic of maximal dimension.} This answers a question of V. Ginzburg.   Finally, we discuss these results in the context of mirror symmetry and Landau--Ginzburg models for Fano varieties.
