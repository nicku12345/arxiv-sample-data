Let M\subset{\complex}^n be a complex domain of {\complex}^n endowed with a rotation invariant \K form \omega_{\Phi}= \frac{i}{2} \partial\bar\partial\Phi. In this paper we describe sufficient conditions on the \K potential \Phi for (M, \omega_{\Phi}) to admit a symplectic embedding (explicitely described in terms of \Phi) into a complex space form of the same dimension of M. In particular we also provide conditions on \Phi for (M, \omega_{\Phi}) to admit global symplectic coordinates. As an application of our results we prove that each of the Ricci flat (but not flat) \K forms on {\complex}^2 constructed by LeBrun (Taub-NUT metric) admits explicitely computable global symplectic coordinates.
