In this paper after extending the definition of symplectic duality (given by the first two authors in arXiv:math/0603141 for bounded symmetric domains) to arbitrary complex domains of {\C}^n centered at the origin we generalize some of the results proved in arXiv:math/0603141 and arXiv:0707.2125 to those domains.
