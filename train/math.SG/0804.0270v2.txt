In this paper we study certain algebraic properties of the quantum homology algebra for the class of symplectic toric Fano manifolds. In particular, we examine the semi-simplicity of the quantum homology algebra, and the more general property of containing a field as a direct summand. Our main result provides an easily-verified sufficient condition for these properties which is independent of the symplectic form. Moreover, we answer two questions of Entov and Polterovich negatively by providing examples of toric Fano manifolds with non semi-simple quantum homology algebra, and others in which the Calabi quasi-morphism is non-unique.
