In this paper, we apply the idea of T-duality to projective spaces. From a connection on a line bundle on \mathbb P^n, a Lagrangian in the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model is constructed. Under this correspondence, the full strong exceptional collection \mathcal O_{\mathbb P^n}(-n-1),...,\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^n}(-1) is mapped to standard Lagrangians in the sense of \cite{nz}. Passing to constructible sheaves, we explicitly compute the quiver structure of these Lagrangians, and find that they match the quiver structure of this exceptional collection of \mathbb P^n. In this way, T-duality provides quasi-equivalence of the Fukaya category generated by these Lagrangians and the category of coherent sheaves on \mathbb P^n, which is a kind of homological mirror symmetry.
