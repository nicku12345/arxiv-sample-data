Consider a Hamiltonian action by biholomorphisms of a compact Lie group K on a Kaehler manifold X, with moment map \mu:X\to\klie^*. We characterize which orbits of the complexified action of G=K^{\CC} in X intersect \mu^{-1}(0) in terms of the maximal weights \lim_{t\to\infty}\la\mu(e^{\imag ts}\cdot x),s\ra, where s belongs to the Lie algebra of K. We do not impose any a priori restriction on the stabilizer of x. Assuming some mild growth conditions on the action of K on X, we view the maximal weights as defining a maps \lambda_x from the boundary at infinity of the symmetric space K\backslash G to \RR\cup\{\infty\}. We prove that G\cdot x meets \mu^{-1}(0) if: (1) \lambda_x is everywhere nonnegative, (2) any boundary point y such that \lambda_x(y)=0 can be connected with a geodesic in K\backslash G to another boundary point y' satisfying \lambda_x(y')=0. We also prove that \lambda_{g\cdot x}(y)=\lambda_x(y\cdot g) for any g\in G and y\in \partial_{\infty}(K\backslash G).
