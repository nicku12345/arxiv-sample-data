One defines the notion of universal deformation quantization: given any manifold M, any Poisson structure \P on M and any torsionfree linear connection \nabla on M, a universal deformation quantization associates to this data a star product on (M,\P) given by a series of bidifferential operators whose corresponding tensors are given by universal polynomial expressions in the Poisson tensor \P, the curvature tensor R and their covariant iterated derivatives. Such universal deformation quantization exist. We study their unicity at order 3 in the deformation parameter, computing the appropriate universal Poisson cohomology.
