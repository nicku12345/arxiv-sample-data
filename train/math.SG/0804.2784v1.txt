We propose a produre of reduction a locally conformal symplectic structure. This procedure of reduction can be applied to wide class of submanifolds. There are no local obstructions for this procedure. But there are global obstructions. We find a necessary and sufficient condition when this reduction holds in terms of the special kind of de Rham cohomology class (tangent to the characteristic foliation) of the Lee form.
