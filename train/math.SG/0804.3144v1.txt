In this paper, we study the symplectic geometry of singular conifolds of the finite group quotient  W_r=\{(x,y,z,t)|xy-z^{2r}+t^2=0 \}/\mu_r(a,-a,1,0), r\geq 1,  which we call orbi-conifolds. The related orbifold symplectic conifold transition and orbifold symplectic flops are constructed. Let X and Y be two symplectic orbifolds connected by such a flop. We study orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants of exceptional classes on X and Y and show that they have isomorphic Ruan cohomologies. Hence, we verify a conjecture of Ruan.
