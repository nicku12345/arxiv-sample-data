We define a local Riemann-Roch number for an open symplectic manifold when a complete integrable system without Bohr-Sommerfeld fiber is provided on its end. In particular when a structure of a singular Lagrangian fibration is given on a closed symplectic manifold, its Riemann-Roch number is described as the sum of the number of nonsingular Bohr-Sommerfeld fibers and a contribution of the singular fibers. A key step of the proof is formally explained as a version of Witten's deformation applied to a Hilbert bundle.
