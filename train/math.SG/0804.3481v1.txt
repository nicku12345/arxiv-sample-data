It is proved that for any free \mathcal{A}-modules \mathcal{F} and \mathcal{E} of finite rank on some \mathbb{C}-algebraized space (X, \mathcal{A}) a \textit{degenerate} bilinear \mathcal{A}-morphism \Phi: \mathcal{F}\times \mathcal{E}\longrightarrow \mathcal{A} induces a \textit{non-degenerate} bilinear \mathcal{A}-morphism \bar{\Phi}: \mathcal{F}/\mathcal{E}^\perp\times \mathcal{E}/\mathcal{F}^\perp\longrightarrow \mathcal{A}, where \mathcal{E}^\perp and \mathcal{F}^\perp are the \textit{orthogonal} sub-\mathcal{A}-modules associated with \mathcal{E} and \mathcal{F}, respectively. This result generalizes the finite case of the classical result, which states that given two vector spaces W and V, paired into a field k, the induced vector spaces W/V^\perp and V/W^\perp have the same dimension. Some related results are discussed as well.
