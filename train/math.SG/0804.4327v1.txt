We determine the relationship between the contact structure induced by a fibered knot, K, in the three-sphere and the contact structures induced by its various cables. Understanding this relationship allows us to classify fibered cable knots which bound a properly embedded complex curve in the four-ball satisfying a genus constraint. This generalizes the well-known classification of links of plane curve singularities.
