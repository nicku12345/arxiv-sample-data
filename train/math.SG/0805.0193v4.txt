We consider manifolds endowed with a contact pair structure. To such a structure are naturally associated two almost complex structures. If they are both integrable, we call the structure a normal contact pair. We generalize the Morimoto's Theorem on product of almost contact manifolds to flat bundles. We construct some examples on Boothby--Wang fibrations over contact-symplectic manifolds. In particular, these results give new methods to construct complex manifolds.
