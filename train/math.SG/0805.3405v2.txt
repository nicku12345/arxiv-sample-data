We study the (standard) cohomology H^\bullet_{st}(E) of a Courant algebroid E. We prove that if E is transitive, the standard cohomology coincides with the naive cohomology H_{naive}^\bullet(E) as conjectured by Stienon and Xu. For a general Courant algebroid we define a spectral sequence converging to its standard cohomology. If E is with split base, we prove that there exists a natural transgression homomorphism T_3 (with image in H^3_{naive}(E)) which, together with the naive cohomology, gives all H^\bullet_{st}(E). For generalized exact Courant algebroids, we give an explicit formula for T_3 depending only on the \v{S}evera characteristic clas of E.
