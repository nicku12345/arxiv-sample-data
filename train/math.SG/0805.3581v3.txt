In this paper, we prove that for a generic choice of tame (or compatible) almost complex structures J on a symplectic manifold (M^{2n},\omega) with n \geq 3 and with its first Chern class c_1(M,\omega) = 0, all somewhere injective J-holomorphic maps from any closed smooth Riemann surface into M are \emph{embedded}. We derive this result as a consequence of the general optimal 1-jet evaluation transversality result of J-holomorphic maps in general symplectic manifolds that we also prove in this paper.
