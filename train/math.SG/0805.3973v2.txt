We investigate algebraicity properties of quotients of complex spaces by complex reductive Lie groups G. We obtain a projectivity result for compact momentum map quotients of algebraic G-varieties. Furthermore, we prove equivariant versions of Kodaira's Embedding Theorem and Chow's Theorem relative to an analytic Hilbert quotient. Combining these results we derive an equivariant algebraisation theorem for complex spaces with projective quotient.
