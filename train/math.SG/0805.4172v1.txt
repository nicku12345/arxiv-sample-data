We survey the basic notions of scattering theory in Hamiltonian mechanics with a particular attention to the analogies with scattering theory in quantum mechanics. We discuss the scattering symplectomorphism, which is analogous to the scattering matrix. We prove identities which relate the Calabi invariant of the scattering symplectomorphism to the total time delay and the regularised phase space volume. These identities are analogous to the Birman-Krein formula and the Eisenbud-Wigner formula in quantum scattering theory.
