We present another view dealing with the Arnold-Givental conjecture on a real symplectic manifold   (M, \omega, \tau) with nonempty and compact real part L={\rm Fix}(\tau). For given \Lambda\in (0, +\infty] and m\in\N\cup\{0\} we show the equivalence of the following two claims: (i)   \sharp(L\cap\phi^H_1(L))\ge m for any Hamiltonian function H\in C_0^\infty([0, 1]\times M) with Hofer's norm \|H\|<\Lambda; (ii) \sharp {\cal P}(H,\tau)\ge m for every H\in C^\infty_0(\R/\Z\times M) satisfying H(t,x)=H(-t,\tau(x))\;\forall (t,x)\in\mathbb{R}\times M and with Hofer's norm \|H\|<2\Lambda, where {\cal P}(H, \tau) is the set of all 1-periodic solutions of \dot{x}(t)=X_{H}(t,x(t)) satisfying x(-t)=\tau(x(t))\;\forall t\in\R (which are also called brake orbits sometimes). Suppose that (M, \omega) is geometrical bounded for some J\in{\cal J}(M,\omega) with \tau^\ast J=-J and has a rationality index r_\omega>0 or r_\omega=+\infty. Using Hofer's method we prove that if the Hamiltonian H in (ii) above has Hofer's norm \|H\|<r_\omega then \sharp(L\cap\phi^H_1(L))\ge\sharp {\cal P}_0(H,\tau)\ge {\rm Cuplength}_{\F}(L) for \F=\Z_2, and further for \F=\Z if L is orientable, where {\cal P}_0(H,\tau) consists of all contractible solutions in {\cal P}(H,\tau).
