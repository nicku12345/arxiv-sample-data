Suppose that L is a null--homologous Legendrian knot in a contact 3--manifold. We determine the connection between the sutured invariant of the complement of L and the Legendrian invariant defined by Lisca, Ozsvath, Stipsicz and Szabo. In particular, we derive a vanishing theorem for the Legendrian invariant in the presence of Giroux torsion in the complement of the knot, and reprove several known properties of the Legendrian invariant from this perspective.
