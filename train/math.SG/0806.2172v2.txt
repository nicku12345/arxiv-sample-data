We continue our study of the knot Floer homology invariants of cable knots. For large |n|, we prove that many of the filtered subcomplexes in the knot Floer homology filtration associated to the (p,pn+1) cable of a knot, K, are isomorphic to those of K. This result allows us to obtain information about the behavior of the Ozsvath-Szabo concordance invariant under cabling, which has geometric consequences for the cabling operation. Applications considered include quasipositivity in the braid group, the knot theory of complex curves, smooth concordance, and lens space (or, more generally, L-space) surgeries.
