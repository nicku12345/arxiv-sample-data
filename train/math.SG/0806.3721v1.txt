We prove a generalization of a theorem of Borel-Harish-Chandra on closed orbits of linear actions of reductive groups.   Consider a real reductive algebraic group G acting linearly and rationally on a real vector space V. G can be viewed as the real points of a complex reductive group G^\mathbb C which acts on V^\mathbb C := V \otimes \mathbb C. Borel-Harish-Chandra show that G^\mathbb C \cdot v \cap V is a finite union of G-orbits; moreover, G^\mathbb C \cdot v is closed if and only if G\cdot v is closed. We show that the same result holds not just for closed orbits but for the so-called distinguished orbits. An orbit is called distinguished if it contains a critical point of the norm squared of the moment map on projective space. Our main result compares the complex and real settings to show G\cdot v is distinguished if and only if G^\mathbb C \cdot v is distinguished.   In addition, we show that if an orbit is distinguished, then under the negative gradient flow of the norm squared of the moment map the entire G-orbit collapses to a single K-orbit. This result holds in both the complex and real settings.   We finish with some applications to the study of the left-invariant geometry of Lie groups.
