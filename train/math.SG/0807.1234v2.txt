This paper demostrates a method for analysing almost CR geometries (H,J), by uniquley defining a partially integrable structure (H,K) from the same data. Thus two almost CR geometries (H,J) and (H',J') are equivalent if and and only if they generate isomorphic induced partially integrable CR geometries (H,K) and (H',K'), and if the set of CR morphisms between these spaces contains an element that maps J to J'. Similar results hold for almost Lagrangian structures.
