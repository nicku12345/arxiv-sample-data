Let F be a genus g curve and \sigma: F \to F a real structure with the maximal possible number of fixed circles. We study the real moduli space \N' = \Fix (\sigma^{#}) where \sigma^{#}: \N \to \N is the induced real structure on the moduli space \N of stable holomorphic bundles of rank 2 over F with fixed non-trivial determinant. In particular, we calculate H^* (\N',\mathbb Z) in the case of g = 2, generalizing Thaddeus' approach to computing H^* (\N,\mathbb Z).
