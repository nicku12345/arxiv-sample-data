The symplectic Floer homology HF_*(f) of a symplectomorphism f:S->S encodes data about the fixed points of f using counts of holomorphic cylinders in R x M_f, where M_f is the mapping torus of f. We give an algorithm to compute HF_*(f) for f a surface symplectomorphism in a pseudo-Anosov or reducible mapping class, completing the computation of Seidel's HF_*(h) for h any orientation-preserving mapping class.
