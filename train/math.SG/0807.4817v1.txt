Any singular level of a completely integrable system (c.i.s.) with non-degenerate singularities has a singular affine structure. We shall show how to construct a simple c.i.s. around the level, having the above affine structure. The cotangent budle of the desingularised level is used to perform the construction, and the c.i.s. obtained looks like the simplest one associated to the affine structure. This method of construction is used to provide several examples of c.i.s. with different kinds of non-degenerate singularities.
