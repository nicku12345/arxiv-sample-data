Capacities that provide both qualitative and quantitative obstructions to the existence of a Lagrangian cobordism between two (n-1)-dimensional submanifolds in parallel hyperplanes of \mathbb{R}^{2n} are defined using the theory of generating families. Qualitatively, these capacities show that, for example, in \mathbb R^4 there is no Lagrangian cobordism between two \infty-shaped curves with a negative crossing when the lower end is "smaller". Quantitatively, when the boundary of a Lagrangian ball lies in a hyperplane of \mathbb{R}^{2n}, the capacity of the boundary gives a restriction on the size of a rectangular cylinder into which the Lagrangian ball can be squeezed.
