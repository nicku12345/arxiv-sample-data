A collection of simple closed curves in \rr^3 is called a negative slice if it is the intersection of a flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian surface and \{y_2 = a \} for some a < 0. Examples and non-examples of negative slices are given. Embedded Lagrange cobordisms define a relation on slices and in some (and perhaps all) cases this relation defines a partial order. The set of slices is a commutative monoid and the additive structure has an interesting relationship with the ordering relation.
