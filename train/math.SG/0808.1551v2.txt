In this expository paper, we discuss how Fourier-Mukai-type transformations, which we call SYZ mirror transformations, can be applied to provide a geometric understanding of the mirror symmetry phenomena for semi-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds and toric Fano manifolds. We also speculate the possible applications of these transformations to other more general settings.
