Let G be a reductive Lie group and {\mathcal O} the coadjoint orbit of a hyperbolic element of {\frak g}^*. By \pi is denoted the unitary irreducible representation of G associated with {\mathcal O} by the orbit method. We give geometric interpretations in terms of concepts related to {\mathcal O} of the constant \pi(g), for g\in Z(G).   We also offer a description of the invariant \pi(g) in terms of action integrals and Berry phases. In the spirit of the orbit method we interpret geometrically the infinitesimal character of the differential representation of \pi.
