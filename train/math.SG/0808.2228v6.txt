Let (X,\omega) be a compact symplectic manifold, L be a Lagrangian submanifold and V be a codimension 2 symplectic submanifold of X, we consider the pseudoholomorphic maps from a Riemann surface with boundary (\Sigma,\partial\Sigma) to the pair (X,L) satisfying Lagrangian boundary conditions and intersecting V. In some special cases, for instance, under the semi-positivity condition, we study the stable moduli space of such open pseudoholomorphic maps involving the intersection data. If L\cap V=\emptyset, we study the problem of orientability of the moduli space. Moreover, assume that there exists an anti-symplectic involution \phi on X such that L is the fixed point set of \phi and V is \phi-anti-invariant, then we define the so-called "relatively open" invariants for the tuple (X,\omega,V,\phi) if L is orientable and dimX\le 6. If L is nonorientable, we define such invariants under the condition that dimX\le4 and some additional restrictions on the number of marked points on each boundary component of the domain.
