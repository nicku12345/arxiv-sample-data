Let \Delta be a Delzant polytope in {\mathbb R}^n and {\bf b}\in{\mathbb   Z}^n.   Let E denote the symplectic fibration over S^2 determined by the pair (\Delta, {\bf b}). We prove the equivalence between the fact that (\Delta, {\bf b}) is a mass linear pair (D. McDuff, S. Tolman, {\em Polytopes with mass linear functions, part I.} {\tt arXiv:0807.0900 [math.SG]}) and the vanishing of a characteristic number of E in the following cases: When \Delta is a \Delta_{n-1} bundle over \Delta_1; when \Delta is the polytope associated with the one point blow up of {\mathbb C}P^n; and when \Delta is the polytope associated with a Hirzebruch surface.
