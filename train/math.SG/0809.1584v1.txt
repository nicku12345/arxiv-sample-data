We formulate a sufficient condition for non-displaceability (by Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms which are identity outside of a compact) of a pair of subsets in a cotangent bundle. This condition is based on micro-local analysis of sheaves on manifolds by Kashiwara-Schapira. This condition is used to prove that the real projective space and the Clifford torus inside the complex projective space are mutually non-displaceable
