We study germs of J-Holomorphic curves contained in M, a real analytic hypersurface of an symplectic manifold of dimension 4. We show, under topological hypothesis on M, that if M is compact then M is of finite type and so there is no germs of J-holomorphic curves on M(with J adapted with the symplectic form). In \Bbb{C}^2 with the standard complex structure, this is a classical result of Diederich-Fornaess.
