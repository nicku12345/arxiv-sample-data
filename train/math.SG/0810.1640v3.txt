Given a symplectic three-fold (M,\omega) we show that for a generic almost complex structure J which is compatible with \omega, there are finitely many J-holomorphic curves in M of any genus g\geq 0 representing a homology class \beta in \H_2(M,\Z) with c_1(M).\beta=0, provided that the divisibility of \beta is at most 4 (i.e. if \beta=n\alpha with \alpha\in H_2(M,\Z) and n\in \Z then n\leq 4). Moreover, each such curve is embedded and 4-rigid.
