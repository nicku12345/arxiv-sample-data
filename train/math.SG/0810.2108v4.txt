We prove a Lagrangian analogue of the Conley conjecture: given a 1-periodic Tonelli Lagrangian with global flow on a closed configuration space, the associated Euler-Lagrange system has infinitely many periodic solutions. More precisely, we show that there exist infinitely many contractible integer periodic solutions with a priori bounded mean action and either infinitely many of them are 1-periodic or they have unbounded period.
