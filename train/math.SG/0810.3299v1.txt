Our main interest in this paper is chiefly concerned with the conditions characterizing \textit{orthogonal and symplectic abstract differential geometries}. A detailed account about the sheaf-theoretic version of the \textit{symplectic Gram-Schmidt theorem} and of the \textit{Witt's theorem} is also given.
