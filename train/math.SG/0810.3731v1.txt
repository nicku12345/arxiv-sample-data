Non-self-adjoint dynamical systems, e.g., nonholonomic systems, can admit an almost Poisson structure, which is formulated by a kind of Poisson bracket satisfying the usual properties except for the Jacobi identity. A general theory of the almost Poisson structure is investigated based on a decomposition of the bracket into a sum of a Poisson one and an almost Poisson one. The corresponding relation between Poisson structure and symplectic structure is proved, making use of Jacobiizer and symplecticizer. Based on analysis of pseudo-symplectic structure of constraint submanifold of Chaplygin nonholonomic systems, an almost Poisson bracket for the systems is constructed and decomposed into a sum of a canonical Poisson one and an almost Poisson one. Similarly, an almost Poisson structure, which can be decomposed into a sum of canonical one and an almost Lie-Poisson one, is also constructed on an affine space with torsion whose autoparallels are utilized to described the free motion of some non-self-adjoint systems. The decomposition of the almost Poisson bracket directly leads to a decomposition of a dynamical vector field into a sum of usual Hamiltionian vector field and an almost Hamiltonian one, which is useful to simplifying the integration of vector fields.
