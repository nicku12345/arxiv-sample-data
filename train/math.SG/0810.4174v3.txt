We determine contact homology algebra of a subcritical Stein-fillable contact manifold whose first Chern class vanishes. We also compute the genus-0 one point correlators and gravitational descendants of compactly supported closed forms of their subcritical Stein fillings. This is a step towards determining the full potential function of the filling as defined in \cite{EliashbergGiventalHofer}. These invariants also give a canonical presentation of the cylindrical contact homology. With respect to this presentation, we determine the degree-2 differential in the Bourgeois--Oancea exact sequence of \cite{Oancea}. As a further application, we proved that if a K\"{a}hler manifold M^{2n} admits a subcritical polarization and c_1 vanishes in the subcritical complement, then M is uniruled.
