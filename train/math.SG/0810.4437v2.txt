We find computable criteria for stability of symplectic leaves of Poisson manifolds. Using Poisson geometry as an inspiration, we also give a general criterion for stability of leaves of Lie algebroids, including singular ones. This not only extends but also provides a new approach (and proofs) to the classical stability results for foliations and group actions.
