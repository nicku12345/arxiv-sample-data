This is a continuation of part I in the series of the papers on Lagrangian Floer theory on toric manifolds. Using the deformations of Floer cohomology by the ambient cycles, which we call bulk deformations, we find a continuum of non-displaceable Lagrangian fibers on some compact toric manifolds. We also provide a method of finding all fibers with non-vanishing Floer cohomology with bulk deformations in arbitrary compact toric manifolds, which we call bulk-balanced Lagrangian fibers.
