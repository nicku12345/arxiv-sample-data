The envelope of holomorphy of an arbitrary domain in a two-dimensional Stein manifold is identified with a connected component of the set of equivalence classes of analytic discs immersed into the Stein manifold with boundary in the domain. This implies, in particular, that for each of its points the envelope of holomorphy contains an embedded (non-singular) Riemann surface (and also an immersed analytic disc) passing through this point with boundary contained in the natural embedding of the original domain into its envelope of holomorphy. Moreover, it says, that analytic continuation to a neighbourhood of an arbitrary point of the envelope of holomorphy can be performed by applying the continuity principle once. Another corollary concerns representation of certain elements of the fundamental group of the domain by boundaries of analytic discs. A particular case is the following. Given a contact three-manifold with Stein filling, any element of the fundamental group of the contact manifold whose representatives are contractible in the filling can be represented by the boundary of an immersed analytic disc.
