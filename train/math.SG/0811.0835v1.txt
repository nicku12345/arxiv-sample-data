In recent work Bertram Kostant and Nolan Wallach ([KW1], [KW2]) have defined an interesting action of a simply connected Lie group A isomorphic to \mathbb{C}^{{n\choose 2}} on gl(n) using a completely integrable system derived from Gelfand-Zeitlin theory. In this paper we show that an analogous action of \mathbb{C}^{d} exists on the complex orthogonal Lie algebra so(n), where d is half the dimension of a regular adjoint orbit in so(n). In [KW1], Kostant and Wallach describe the orbits of A on a certain Zariski open subset of regular semisimple elements in gl(n). We extend these results to the case of so(n). We also make brief mention of the author's results in [Col1], which describe all A-orbits of dimension {n\choose 2} in gl(n).
