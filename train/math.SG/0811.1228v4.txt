Let X_\Sigma be a complete toric variety. The coherent-constructible correspondence \kappa of \cite{FLTZ} equates \Perf_T(X_\Sigma) with a subcategory Sh_{cc}(M_\bR;\LS) of constructible sheaves on a vector space M_\bR. The microlocalization equivalence \mu of \cite{NZ,N} relates these sheaves to a subcategory Fuk(T^*M_\bR;\LS) of the Fukaya category of the cotangent T^*M_\bR. When X_\Si is nonsingular, taking the derived category yields an equivariant version of homological mirror symmetry, DCoh_T(X_\Si)\cong DFuk(T^*M_\bR;\LS), which is an equivalence of triangulated tensor categories.   The nonequivariant coherent-constructible correspondence \bar{\kappa} of \cite{T} embeds \Perf(X_\Si) into a subcategory Sh_c(T_\bR^\vee;\bar{\Lambda}_\Si) of constructible sheaves on a compact torus T_\bR^\vee. When X_\Si is nonsingular, the composition of \bar{\kappa} and microlocalization yields a version of homological mirror symmetry, DCoh(X_\Sigma)\hookrightarrow DFuk(T^*T_\bR;\bar{\Lambda}_\Si), which is a full embedding of triangulated tensor categories.   When X_\Si is nonsingular and projective, the composition \tau=\mu\circ \kappa is compatible with T-duality, in the following sense. An equivariant ample line bundle \cL has a hermitian metric invariant under the real torus, whose connection defines a family of flat line bundles over the real torus orbits. This data produces a T-dual Lagrangian brane \mathbb L on the universal cover T^*M_\bR of the dual real torus fibration. We prove \mathbb L\cong \tau(\cL) in Fuk(T^*M_\bR;\LS). Thus, equivariant homological mirror symmetry is determined by T-duality.
