In recent work (\cite{KW1},\cite{KW2}), Kostant and Wallach construct an action of a simply connected Lie group A\simeq \mathbb{C}^{{n\choose 2}} on gl(n) using a completely integrable system derived from the Poisson analogue of the Gelfand-Zeitlin subalgebra of the enveloping algebra. In \cite{KW1}, the authors show that A-orbits of dimension {n\choose 2} form Lagrangian submanifolds of regular adjoint orbits in gl(n). They describe the orbit structure of A on a certain Zariski open subset of regular semisimple elements. In this paper, we describe all A-orbits of dimension {n\choose 2} and thus all polarizations of regular adjoint orbits obtained using Gelfand-Zeitlin theory.
