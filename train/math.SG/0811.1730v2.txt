Seidel-Smith and Manolescu constructed knot homology theories using symplectic fibrations whose total spaces were certain varieties of matrices. These knot homology theories were associated to SL(n)  and tensor products of the standard and dual representations. In this paper, we place their geometric setups in a natural, general framework. For any complex reductive group and any sequence of minuscule dominant weights, we construct a fibration of affine varieties over a configuration space. The middle cohomology of these varieties is isomorphic to the space of invariants in the corresponding tensor product of representations. Our construction uses the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian and the geometric Satake correspondence.
