We prove an all genera version of the Crepant Resolution Conjecture of Ruan and Bryan-Graber for type A surface singularities. We are based on a method that explicitly computes Hurwitz-Hodge integrals described in an earlier paper and some recent results by Liu-Xu for some intersection numbers on the Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces. We also generalize our results to some three-dimensional orbifolds.
