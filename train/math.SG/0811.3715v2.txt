Let (M,\omega) be a geometrically bounded symplectic manifold, N\subseteq M a closed, regular (i.e. "fibering") coisotropic submanifold, and \phi:M\to M a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism. The main result of this article is that the number of leafwise fixed points of \phi is bounded below by the sum of the Z_2-Betti numbers of N, provided that the Hofer distance between \phi and the identity is small enough and the pair (N,\phi) is non-degenerate. The bound is optimal if there exists a Z_2-perfect Morse function on N. A version of the Arnol'd-Givental conjecture for coisotropic submanifolds is also discussed. As an application, I prove a presymplectic non-embedding result.
