We study the moduli space of pseudo pointed holomorphic disks with boundaries mapped in the zero section of the cotangent bundle of a manifold. We define perturbations of the equation for which it is possible to describe explicitly all the solutions of the problem in terms of Morse graphs on the manifold. In particular, this proves that the A_\infty structure of the zero section of the cotangent bundle is equivalent to the Morse A_\infty structure of the base manifold.
