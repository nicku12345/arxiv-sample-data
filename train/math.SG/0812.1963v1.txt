The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First we explain the construction of the canonical model of filtered A_\infty-algebras given in the authors' book [FOOO]. The canonical model plays a crucial role in the study of Lagrangian Floer theory on toric manifolds in our recent papers, arXiv:0802.1703 and arXiv:0810.5654. Then using a variation of the arguments used in that construction, we define a natural filtered A_\infty-structure on the Morse complex of a Morse function and its A_\infty homotopy to the A_\infty-algebras on a Lagrangian submanifold constructed in [FOOO]. The corresponding graphical moduli spaces `summing over trees' involve holomorphic discs connected by the gradient flow lines.
