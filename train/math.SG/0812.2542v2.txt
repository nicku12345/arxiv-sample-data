In this article, we construct the reduced genus-two Gromov-Witten invariants for certain almost K\"{a}hler manifold (X, \omega, J) such that J is integrable and satisfies some regularity conditions. In particular, the standard projective space (\P^n, \omega_0, J_0) of dimension n \le 7 satisfies these conditions. This invariant counts the number of simple genus-two J-holomorphic curves that satisfy appropriate number of constraints.
