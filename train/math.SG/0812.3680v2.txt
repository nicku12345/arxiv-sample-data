For any compact almost complex manifold (M,J), the last two authors defined two subgroups H_J^+(M), H_J^-(M) of the degree 2 real de Rham cohomology group H^2(M, \mathbb{R}) in arXiv:0708.2520. These are the sets of cohomology classes which can be represented by J-invariant, respectively, J-anti-invariant real 2-forms. In this note, it is shown that in dimension 4 these subgroups induce a cohomology decomposition of H^2(M, \mathbb{R}). This is a specifically 4-dimensional result, as it follows from a recent work of Fino and Tomassini. Some estimates for the dimensions of these groups are also established when the almost complex structure is tamed by a symplectic form and an equivalent formulation for a question of Donaldson is given.
