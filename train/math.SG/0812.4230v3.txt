We study symplectic manifolds (M^{2l},\omega) equipped with a symplectic torsion-free affine (also called Fedosov) connection \nabla and admitting a metaplectic structure. Let \mathcal{S} be the so called symplectic spinor bundle and let R^S be the curvature tensor field of the symplectic spinor covariant derivative \nabla^S associated to the Fedosov connection \nabla. It is known that the space of symplectic spinor valued exterior differential 2-forms, \Gamma(M,\bigwedge^2T^*M\otimes {\mathcal{S}}), decomposes into three invariant spaces with respect to the structure group, which is the metaplectic group Mp(2l,\mathbb{R}) in this case. For a symplectic spinor field \phi \in \Gamma(M,\mathcal{S}), we compute explicitly the projections of R^S\phi \in \Gamma(M,\bigwedge^2T^*M \otimes \mathcal{S}) onto the three mentioned invariant spaces in terms of the symplectic Ricci and symplectic Weyl curvature tensor fields of the connection \nabla. Using this decomposition, we derive a complex of first order differential operators provided the Weyl tensor of the Fedosov connection is trivial.
