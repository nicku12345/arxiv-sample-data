This research announcement discusses our results on Gromov-Witten theory of root gerbes. A complete calculation of genus 0 Gromov-Witten theory of \mu_{r}-root gerbes over a smooth base scheme is obtained by a direct analysis of virtual fundamental classes. Our result verifies the genus 0 part of the so-called decomposition conjecture which compares Gromov-Witten theory of \'etale gerbes with that of the bases. We also verify this conjecture in all genera for toric gerbes over toric Deligne-Mumford stacks.
