We study pairs of structures, such as the Poisson-Nijenhuis structures, on the tangent bundle of a manifold or, more generally, on a Lie algebroid or a Courant algebroid. These composite structures are defined by two of the following, a closed 2-form, a Poisson bivector or a Nijenhuis tensor, with suitable compatibility assumptions. We establish the relationships between such composite structures. We then show that the non-degenerate Monge-Amp\`ere structures on 2-dimensional manifolds satisfying an integrability condition provide numerous examples of such structures, while in the case of 3-dimensional manifolds, such Monge-Amp\`ere operators give rise to generalized complex structures or generalized product structures on the cotangent bundle of the manifold.
