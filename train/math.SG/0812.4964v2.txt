In their 2007 paper, Jarvis, Kaufmann, and Kimura defined the full orbifold K-theory of an orbifold {\mathfrak X}, analogous to the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology of {\mathfrak X} in that it uses the obstruction bundle as a quantum correction to the multiplicative structure. We give an explicit algorithm for the computation of this orbifold invariant in the case when {\mathfrak X} arises as an abelian symplectic quotient. Our methods are integral K-theoretic analogues of those used in the orbifold cohomology case by Goldin, Holm, and Knutson in 2005. We rely on the K-theoretic Kirwan surjectivity methods developed by Harada and Landweber. As a worked class of examples, we compute the full orbifold K-theory of weighted projective spaces that occur as a symplectic quotient of a complex affine space by a circle. Our computations hold over the integers, and in the particular case of weighted projective spaces, we show that the associated invariant is torsion-free.
