In the note we study Legendrian and transverse knots in rationally null-homologous knot types. In particular we generalize the standard definitions of self-linking number, Thurston-Bennequin invariant and rotation number. We then prove a version of Bennequin's inequality for these knots and classify precisely when the Bennequin bound is sharp for fibered knot types. Finally we study rational unknots and show they are weakly Legendrian and transversely simple.   This version of the paper corrects the definition of rational self-linking number in the previous and published version of the paper. With this correction all the main results of the paper remain true as originally stated.
