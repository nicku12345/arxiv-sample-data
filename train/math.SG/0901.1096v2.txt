In \cite{confol} Y. Eliashberg and W. Thurston gave a definition of tight confoliations. We give an example of a tight confoliation \xi on T^3 violating the Thurston-Bennequin inequalities. This answers a question from \cite{confol} negatively. Although the tightness of a confoliation does not imply the Thurston-Bennequin inequalities, it is still possible to prove restrictions on homotopy classes of plane fields which contain tight confoliations.   The failure of the Thurston-Bennequin inequalities for tight confoliations is due to the presence of overtwisted stars. Overtwisted stars are particular configurations of Legendrian curves which bound a disc with finitely many punctures on the boundary. We prove that the Thurston-Bennequin inequalities hold for tight confoliations without overtwisted stars and that symplectically fillable confoliations do not admit overtwisted stars.
