We discuss a conjecture of Donaldson on a version of Yau's Theorem for symplectic forms with compatible almost complex structures and survey some recent progress on this problem. We also speculate on some future possible directions, and use a monotonicity formula for harmonic maps to obtain a new local estimate in the setting of Donaldson's conjecture.
