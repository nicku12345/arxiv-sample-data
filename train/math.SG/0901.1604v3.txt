In this short note, we compute the Betti numbers of the moduli stack of flat SU(3)-bundles over a Klein bottle. We also handle the general compact group case over RP^2. In all cases the cohomology is found to be equivariantly formal, supporting a conjecture from the author's doctoral thesis. Our results also verify conjectural formulas obtained by Ho-Liu using Yang-Mills Morse theory.
