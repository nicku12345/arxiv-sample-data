In this article we consider a version of the geography question for simply-connected symplectic 4-manifolds that takes into account the divisibility of the canonical class as an additional parameter. We also find new examples of 4-manifolds admitting several symplectic structures, inequivalent under deformation and self-diffeomorphisms of the manifold.
