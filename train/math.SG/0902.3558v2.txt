We establish a 1:1 correspondence between Poisson-Lie group actions on integrable Poisson manifolds and twisted multiplicative hamiltonian actions on source 1-connected symplectic groupoids. For an action of a Poisson-Lie group G on a Poisson manifold M, we find an explicit description of the lifted hamiltonian action on the symplectic groupoid \Sigma(M). We give applications of these results to the integration of Poisson quotients M/G, Lu-Weinstein quotients \mu^{-1}(e)/G and Poisson homogeneous spaces G/H.
