We relate the version of rational Symplectic Field Theory for exact Lagrangian cobordisms introduced in [5] with linearized Legendrian contact homology. More precisely, if L\subset X is an exact Lagrangian submanifold of an exact symplectic manifold with convex end \Lambda\subset Y, where Y is a contact manifold and \Lambda is a Legendrian submanifold, and if L has empty concave end, then the linearized Legendrian contact cohomology of \Lambda, linearized with respect to the augmentation induced by L, equals the rational SFT of (X,L). Following ideas of P. Seidel, this equality in combination with a version of Lagrangian Floer cohomology of L leads us to a conjectural exact sequence which in particular implies that if X=\C^{n} then the linearized Legendrian contact cohomology of \Lambda\subset S^{2n-1} is isomorphic to the singular homology of L. We outline a proof of the conjecture and show how to interpret the duality exact sequence for linearized contact homology of [6] in terms of the resulting isomorphism.
