This is the first of at least two articles that describe the moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic, multiply punctured spheres in R x (S^1 x S^2) as defined by a certain natural pair of almost complex structure and symplectic form. This article proves that all moduli space components are smooth manifolds. Necessary and sufficient conditions are also given for a collection of closed curves in S^1 x S^2 to appear as the set of |s| --> infinity limits of the constant s in R slices of a pseudoholomorphic, multiply punctured sphere.
