Modifying the method of [21], we compute the perturbed HF^+ for some special classes of fibered three manifolds in the second highest spin^c-structures S_{g-2}. The special classes considered in this paper include the mapping tori of Dehn twists along a single non-separating curve and along a transverse pair of curves.
