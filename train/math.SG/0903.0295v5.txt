We give a possible generalization of Lutz twist to all dimensions. This reproves the fact that every contact manifold can be given a non-fillable contact structure and also shows great flexibility in the manifolds that can be realized as cores of overtwisted families. We moreover show that R^{2n+1} has at least three distinct contact structures.   This version of the paper contains both the texts of the published version of the paper together with an Erratum to the published version appended to the end.
