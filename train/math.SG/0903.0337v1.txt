This is the second of two articles that describe the moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic, multiply punctured spheres in R x (S^1 x S^2) as defined by a certain natural pair of almost complex structure and symplectic form. The first article in this series described the local structure of the moduli spaces and gave existence theorems. This article describes a stratification of the moduli spaces and gives explicit parametrizations for the various strata.
