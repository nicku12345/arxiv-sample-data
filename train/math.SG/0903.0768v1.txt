The Rabinowitz-Floer homology groups RFH_*(M,W) are associated to an exact embedding of a contact manifold (M,\xi) into a symplectic manifold (W,\omega). They depend only on the bounded component V of W\setminus M. We construct a long exact sequence in which symplectic cohomology of V maps to symplectic homology of V, which in turn maps to Rabinowitz-Floer homology RFH_*(M,W), which then maps to symplectic cohomology of V. We compute RFH_*(ST^*L,T^*L), where ST^*L is the unit cosphere bundle of a closed manifold L. As an application, we prove that the image of an exact contact embedding of ST^*L (endowed with the standard contact structure) cannot be displaced away from itself by a Hamiltonian isotopy, provided \dim L\ge 4 and the embedding induces an injection on \pi_1. In particular, ST^*L does not admit an exact contact embedding into a subcritical Stein manifold if L is simply connected. We also prove that Weinstein's conjecture holds in symplectic manifolds which admit exact displaceable codimension 0 embeddings.
