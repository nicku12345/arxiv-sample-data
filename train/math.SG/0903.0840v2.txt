Let (G,K) be a Riemannian symmetric pair of maximal rank, where G is a compact simply connected Lie group and K the fixed point set of an involutive automorphism \sigma. This induces an involutive automorphism \tau of the based loop space \Omega(G). There exists a maximal torus T\subset G such that the canonical action of T\times S^1 on \Omega(G) is compatible with \tau (in the sense of Duistermaat). This allows us to formulate and prove a version of Duistermaat's convexity theorem. Namely, the images of \Omega(G) and \Omega(G)^\tau (fixed point set of \tau) under the T\times S^1 moment map on \Omega(G) are equal. The space \Omega(G)^\tau is homotopy equivalent to the loop space \Omega(G/K) of the Riemannian symmetric space G/K. We prove a stronger form of a result of Bott and Samelson which relates the cohomology rings with coefficients in \mathbb{Z}_2 of \Omega(G) and \Omega(G/K). Namely, the two cohomology rings are isomorphic, by a degree-halving isomorphism (Bott and Samelson had proved that the Betti numbers are equal). A version of this theorem involving equivariant cohomology is also proved. The proof uses the notion of conjugation space in the sense of Hausmann, Holm, and Puppe.
