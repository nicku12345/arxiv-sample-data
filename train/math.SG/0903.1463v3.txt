We introduce an integral structure in orbifold quantum cohomology associated to the K-group and the Gamma-class. In the case of compact toric orbifolds, we show that this integral structure matches with the natural integral structure for the Landau-Ginzburg model under mirror symmetry. By assuming the existence of an integral structure, we give a natural explanation for the specialization to a root of unity in Y. Ruan's crepant resolution conjecture.
