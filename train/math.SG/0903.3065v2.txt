We use the quilt formalism of Mau-Wehrheim-Woodward to give a sufficient condition for a finite collection of Lagrangian submanifolds to split-generate the Fukaya category, and deduce homological mirror symmetry for the standard 4-torus. As an application, we study Lagrangian genus two surfaces of Maslov class zero, deriving numerical restrictions on the intersections of such a surface with linear Lagrangian 2-tori in in the 4-torus.
