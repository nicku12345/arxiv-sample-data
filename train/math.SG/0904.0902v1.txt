For a flag manifold M=G/B with the canonical torus action, the T-equivariant cohomology is generated by equivariant Schubert classes, with one class \tau_u for every element u of the Weyl group W. These classes are determined by their restrictions to the fixed point set M^T \simeq W, and the restrictions are polynomials with nonnegative integer coefficients in the simple roots.   The main result of this article is a positive formula for computing \tau_u(v) in types A, B, and C. To obtain this formula we identify G/B with a generic co-adjoint orbit and use a result of Goldin and Tolman to compute \tau_u(v) in terms of the induced moment map. Our formula, given as a sum of contributions of certain maximal ascending chains from u to v, follows from a systematic degeneration of the moment map, corresponding to degenerating the co-adjoint orbit. In type A we prove that our formula is manifestly equivalent to the formula announced by Billey in \cite{Bi}, but in type C, the two formulas are not equivalent.
