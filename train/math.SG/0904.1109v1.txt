Let (M, g) be a real analytic Kaehler manifold. We say that a smooth map E_p:W\to M from a neighborhood W of the origin of T_pM into M is a {\em diastatic exponential} at p if it satisfies (d \E_p)_0=\id_{T_pM}, D_p(\E_p (v))=g_p(v, v), \forall v\in W, where D_p is Calabi's diastasis function at p (the usual exponential \exp_p obviously satisfied these equations when D_p is replaced by the square of the geodesics distance d^2_p from p). In this paper we prove that for every point p of an Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type M there exists a globally defined diastatic exponential centered in p which is a diffeomorphism and it is uniquely determined by its restriction to polydisks. An analogous result holds true in an open dense neighborhood of every point of M^*, the compact dual of M. We also provide a geometric interpretation of the symplectic duality map in terms of diastatic exponentials. As a byproduct of our analysis we show that the symplectic duality map pulls back the reproducing kernel of M^* to the reproducing kernel of M.
