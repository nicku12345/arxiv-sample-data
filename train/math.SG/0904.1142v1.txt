Let M be a manifold with a volume form \omega and f : M \to M be a diffeomorphism of class \mathcal{C}^1 that preserves \omega. In this paper, we do \textit{not} assume f is \mathcal{C}^1-generic. We have two main themes in the paper: (1) the chain recurrence; (2) relations among recurrence points, homoclinic points, shadowability and hyperbolicity. For (1) (without assuming M is compact), we have the theorem: if f is Lagrange stable, then M is a chain recurrent set. If M is compact, then the Lagrange-stability is automatic. For (2) (assuming the compactness of M), we prove some various implications among notions, such as: (i) the \mathcal{C}^1-stable shadowability equals to the hyperbolicity of M; (ii) if a point p\in M has a recurrence point in the unstable manifold W^u (p, f) and there is no homoclinic point of p, then f is nonshadowable; (iii) if f has the shadowing property and p has a recurrence point in W^u (p, f), then the recurrent point is in the limit set of homoclinic points of p.
