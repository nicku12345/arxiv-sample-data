We prove that the algebra of singular cochains on a smooth manifold, equipped with the cup product, is equivalent to the A-infinity structure on the Lagrangian Floer cochain group associated to the zero section in the cotangent bundle. More generally, given a pair of smooth manifolds of the same dimension with embeddings of a submanifold B with isomorphic normal bundles, we construct a differential graded category from the singular cochains of these spaces, and prove that it is equivalent to the A-infinity category obtained by considering exact Lagrangian embeddings intersecting cleanly along B.
