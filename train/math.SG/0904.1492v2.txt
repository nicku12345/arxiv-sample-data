We establish a product formula for Gromov-Witten invariants for closed, connected, relatively semi-positive Hamiltonian fibrations over any symplectic base. Furthermore, we show that the fibration projection induces a locally trivial (orbi-)fibration map from the moduli space of pseudo-holomorphic maps with marked points in the total space of the Hamiltonian fibration to the corresponding moduli space of pseudo-holomorphic maps with marked points in the base. We use this induced map to recover the product formula by means of integration. Finally, we give applications to c-splitting and symplectic uniruledness.
