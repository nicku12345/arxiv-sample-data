We construct using Lefschetz fibrations a large family of contact manifolds with the following properties: Any bounding contact embedding into an exact symplectic manifold satisfying a mild topological assumption is non-displaceable and generically has infinitely many leaf-wise intersection points. Moreover, any Stein filling has infinite dimensional symplectic homology.
