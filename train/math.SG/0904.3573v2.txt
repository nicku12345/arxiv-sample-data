In this paper, we establish general stratawise higher jet evaluation transversality of J-holomorphic curves for a generic choice of almost complex structures J tame to a given symplectic manifold (M,\omega). Using this transversality result, we prove that there exists a subset \CJ_\omega^{ram} \subset \CJ_\omega of second category such that for every J \in \CJ_\omega^{ram}, the dimension of the moduli space of (somewhere injective) J-holomorphic curves with a given ramification profile goes down by 2n or 2(n-1) depending on whether the ramification degree goes up by one or a new ramification point is created. We also derive that for each J \in \CJ_\omega^{ram} there are only a finite number of ramification profiles of J-holomorphic curves in a given homology class \beta \in H_2(M;\Z) and provide an explicit upper bound on the number of ramification profiles in terms of c_1(\beta) and the genus g of the domain surface.
