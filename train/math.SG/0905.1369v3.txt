We define relative Floer theoretic invariants arising from 'quilted pseudo-holomorphic surfaces': Collections of pseudoholomorphic maps to various target spaces with 'seam conditions' in Lagrangian correspondences. As application we construct a morphism on quantum homology associated to any monotone Lagrangian correspondence.
