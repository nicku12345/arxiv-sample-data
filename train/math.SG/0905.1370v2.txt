We generalize Lagrangian Floer cohomology to sequences of Lagrangian correspondences. For sequences related by the geometric composition of Lagrangian correspondences we establish an isomorphism of the Floer cohomologies. We give applications to calculations of Floer cohomology, displaceability of Lagrangian correspondences, and transfer of displaceability under geometric composition.
