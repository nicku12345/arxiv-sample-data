Let \mathcal{X}_1 and \mathcal{X}_2 be smooth proper Deligne-Mumford stacks with projective coarse moduli spaces. We prove a formula for orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants of the product stack \mathcal{X}_1\times \mathcal{X}_2 in terms of Gromov-Witten invariants of the factors \mathcal{X}_1 and \mathcal{X}_2. As an application, we deduce a decomposition result for Gromov-Witten theory of trivial gerbes.
