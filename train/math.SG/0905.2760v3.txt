We prove that the class of topological knot types that are both Legendrian simple and satisfy the uniform thickness property (UTP) is closed under cabling. An immediate application is that all iterated cabling knot types that begin with negative torus knots are Legendrian simple. We also examine, for arbitrary numbers of iterations, iterated cablings that begin with positive torus knots, and establish the Legendrian simplicity of large classes of these knot types, many of which also satisfy the UTP. In so doing we obtain new necessary conditions for both the failure of the UTP and Legendrian non-simplicity in the class of iterated torus knots, including specific conditions on knot types.
