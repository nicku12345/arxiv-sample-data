Consider a Hamiltonian action of a compact connected Lie group G on an aspherical symplectic manifold (M,\omega). Under some assumptions on (M,\omega) and the action, D. A. Salamon conjectured that counting gauge equivalence classes of symplectic vortices on the plane R^2 gives rise to a quantum deformation Q\kappa_G of the Kirwan map. This article is the first of three, whose goal is to define Q\kappa_G rigorously. Its main result is that the vertical differential of the vortex equations over R^2 (at the level of gauge equivalence) is a Fredholm operator of a specified index. Potentially, the map Q\kappa_G can be used to compute the quantum cohomology of many symplectic quotients. Conjecturally it also gives rise to quantum generalizations of non-abelian localization and abelianization (see [Woodward-Ziltener]).
