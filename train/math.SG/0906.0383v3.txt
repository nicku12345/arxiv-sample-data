Various Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomologies are defined for a closed, oriented 3-manifold; and if it is the mapping torus of an area-preserving surface automorphism, it has an associated periodic Floer homology as defined by Michael Hutchings. We construct an isomorphism between a certain version of Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology and the corresponding periodic Floer homology, and describe some immediate consequences.
