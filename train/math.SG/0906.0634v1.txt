We prove that the Calabi-Yau equation can be solved on the Kodaira-Thurston manifold for all given T^2-invariant volume forms. This provides support for Donaldson's conjecture that Yau's theorem has an extension to symplectic four-manifolds with compatible but non-integrable almost complex structures.
