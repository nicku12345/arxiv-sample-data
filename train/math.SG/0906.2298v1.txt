This is the second of a series of papers dealing with the asymptotic behavior of certain integrals occuring in the description of the spectrum of an invariant elliptic operator on a compact Riemannian manifold carrying the action of a compact, connected Lie group of isometries, and in the study of its equivariant cohomology via the moment map.
