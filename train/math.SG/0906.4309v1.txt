Let k be a field of characteristic not 2 or 3. Let V be the k-space of binary cubic polynomials. The natural symplectic structure on k^2 promotes to a symplectic structure \omega on V and from the natural symplectic action of \textrm{Sl}(2,k) one obtains the symplectic module (V,\omega). We give a complete analysis of this symplectic module from the point of view of the associated moment map, its norm square Q (essentially the classical discriminant) and the symplectic gradient of Q. Among the results are a symplectic derivation of the Cardano-Tartaglia formulas for the roots of a cubic, detailed parameters for all \textrm{Sl}(2,k) and \textrm{Gl}(2,k)-orbits, in particular identifying a group structure on the set of \textrm{Sl}(2,k)-orbits of fixed nonzero discriminant, and a purely symplectic generalization of the classical Eisenstein syzygy for the covariants of a binary cubic. Such fine symplectic analysis is due to the special symplectic nature inherited from the ambient exceptional Lie algebra \mathfrak G_2.
