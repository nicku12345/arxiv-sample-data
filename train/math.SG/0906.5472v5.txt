In this note, genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants are reviewed and then applied in some examples of dimension four and six. It is also proved that the use of genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants in the class of embedded J-holomorphic curves to distinguish the deformation types of symplectic structures on a smooth 6-manifold is restricted in the sense that they can not distinguish the symplectic structures on X_1\times S^2 and X_2\times S^2 for two minimal, simply connected, symplectic 4-manifolds X_1 and X_2 with b_2^+(X_1)>1 and b_2^+(X_2)>1.
