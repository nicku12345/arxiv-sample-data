We consider the suspension operation on Lefschetz fibrations, which takes p(x) to p(x)-y^2. This leaves the Fukaya category of the fibration invariant, and changes the category of the fibre (or more precisely, the subcategory consisting of a basis of vanishing cycles) in a specific way. As an application, we prove part of Homological Mirror Symmetry for the total spaces of canonical bundles over toric del Pezzo surfaces.
