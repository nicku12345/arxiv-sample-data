Let X be a smooth complex projective algebraic variety. Given a line bundle \mathcal{L} over X and an integer r>1 one defines the stack \sqrt[r]{\mathcal{L}/X} of r-th roots of \mathcal{L}. Motivated by Gromov-Witten theoretic questions, in this paper we analyze the structure of moduli stacks of genus 0 twisted stable maps to \sqrt[r]{\mathcal{L}/X}. Our main results are explicit constructions of moduli stacks of genus 0 twisted stable maps to \sqrt[r]{\mathcal{L}/X} starting from moduli stack of genus 0 stable maps to X. As a consequence, we prove an exact formula expressing genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants of \sqrt[r]{\mathcal{L}/X} in terms of those of X.
