We study the dependence of geometric quantization of the standard symplectic torus on the choice of invariant polarization. Real and mixed polarizations are interpreted as degenerate complex structures. Using a weak version of the equations of covariant constancy, and the Weil-Brezin expansion to describe distributional sections, we give a unified analytical description of the quantization spaces for all nonnegative polarizations.   The Blattner-Kostant-Sternberg (BKS) pairing maps between half-form corrected quantization spaces for different polarizations are shown to be transitive and related to an action of Sp(2g,\R). Moreover, these maps are shown to be unitary.
