This paper initiated an investigation on the following question: Suppose a smooth 4-manifold does not admit any smooth circle actions. Does there exist a constant C>0 such that the manifold support no smooth \Z_p-actions of prime order for p>C? We gave affirmative results to this question for the case of holomorphic and symplectic actions, with an interesting finding that the constant C in the holomorphic case is topological in nature while in the symplectic case it involves also the smooth structure of the manifold.
