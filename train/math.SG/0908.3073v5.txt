An asymptotic expansion formula of Riemann sums over lattice polytopes is given. The formula is an asymptotic form of the local Euler-Maclaurin formula due to Berline-Vergne. The proof given here for Delzant lattice polytopes is independent of the local Euler-Maclaurin formula. But we use it for general lattice polytopes. As corollaries, an explicit formula for each term in the expansion over Delzant polytopes in two dimension and an explicit formula for the third term of the expansion for Delzant polytopes in arbitrary dimension are given. Moreover, some uniqueness results are given.
