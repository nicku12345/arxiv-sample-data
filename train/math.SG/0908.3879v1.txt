We generalize a result of Kostant and Wallach concerning the algebraic integrability of the Gelfand-Zeitlin vector fields to the full set of strongly regular elements in gl(n,\mathbb{C}). We use decomposition classes to stratify the strongly regular set by subvarieties X_{D}. We construct an \'{e}tale cover \hat{\mathfrak{g}} of X_{D} and show that X_{D} and \hat{\mathfrak{g}} are smooth and irreducible. We then use Poisson geometry to lift the Gelfand-Zeitlin vector fields on X_{D} to Hamiltonian vector fields on \hat{\mathfrak{g}} and integrate these vector fields to an action of a connected, commutative algebraic group.
