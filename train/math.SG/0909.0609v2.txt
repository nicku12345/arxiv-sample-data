In lines 8-11 of \cite[pp. 2977]{Lu} we wrote: "For integer m\ge 3, if M is C^m-smooth and   C^{m-1}-smooth L:\R\times TM\to\R satisfies the assumptions (L1)-(L3), then the functional {\cal L}_\tau is C^2-smooth, bounded below, satisfies the Palais-Smale condition, and all critical points of it have finite Morse indexes and nullities (see \cite[Prop.4.1, 4.2]{AbF} and \cite{Be})." However, as proved in \cite{AbSc1} the claim that {\cal L}_\tau is C^2-smooth is true if and only if for every (t,q) the function v\mapsto L(t,q,v) is a polynomial of degree at most 2. So the arguments in \cite{Lu} is only valid for the physical Hamiltonian in (1.2) and corresponding Lagrangian therein. In this note we shall correct our arguments in \cite{Lu} with a new splitting lemma obtained in \cite{Lu2}.
