Lagrangian Floer homology in a general case has been constructed by Fukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono, where they construct an \AI-algebra or an \AI-bimodule from Lagrangian submanifolds, and studied the obstructions and deformation theories. But for obstructed Lagrangian submanifolds, standard Lagrangian Floer homology can not be defined.   We explore several well-known cohomology theories on these \AI-objects and explore their properties, which are well-defined and invariant even in the obstructed cases. These are Hochschild and cyclic homology of an \AI-objects and Chevalley-Eilenberg or cyclic Chevalley-Eilenberg homology of their underlying \LI objects. We explain how the existence of m_0 effects the usual homological algebra of these homology theories. We also provide some computations. We show that for an obstructed \AI-algebra with a non-trivial primary obstruction, Chevalley-Eilenberg Floer homology vanishes, whose proof is inspired by the comparison with cluster homology theory of Lagrangian submanifolds by Cornea and Lalonde.   In contrast, we also provide an example of an obstructed case whose cyclic Floer homology is non-vanishing.
