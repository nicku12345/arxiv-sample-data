Let G be a connected compact Lie group, and let M be a connected Hamiltonian G-manifold with equivariant moment map \phi.   We prove that if there is a simply connected orbit G\cdot x, then \pi_1(M)\cong\pi_1(M/G); if additionally \phi is proper, then \pi_1(M)\cong\pi_1(\phi^{-1}(G\cdot a)), where a=\phi(x).   We also prove that if a maximal torus of G has a fixed point x, then \pi_1(M)\cong\pi_1(M/K), where K is any connected subgroup of G; if additionally \phi is proper, then \pi_1(M)\cong\pi_1(\phi^{-1}(G\cdot a))\cong\pi_1(\phi^{-1}(a)), where a=\phi(x).   Furthermore, we prove that if \phi is proper, then \pi_1\big(M/\Gh\big)\cong\pi_1\big(\phi^{-1}(G\cdot a)/\Gh\big) for all a\in\phi(M), where \Gh is any connected subgroup of G which contains the identity component of each stabilizer group. In particular, \pi_1(M/G)\cong\pi_1(\phi^{-1}(G\cdot a)/G) for all a\in\phi(M).
