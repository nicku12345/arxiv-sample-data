We construct families of quilted surfaces parametrized by the multiplihedra, and define moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic quilted disks using the theory of pseudoholomorphic quilts of Wehrheim and Woodward. We prove a gluing theorem for regular, isolated pseudoholomorphic quilted disks. This analytical result is a fundamental ingredient for the construction of A-infinity functors associated to Lagrangian correspondences.
