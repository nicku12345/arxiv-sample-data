Let (V, \Om) be a symplectic vector space and let \phi: M \ra V be a symplectic immersion. We show that \phi(M) \subset V is (locally) an extrinsic symplectic symmetric space (e.s.s.s.) in the sense of \cite{CGRS} if and only if the second fundamental form of \phi is parallel.   Furthermore, we show that any symmetric space which admits an immersion as an e.s.s.s. also admits a {\em full} such immersion, i.e., such that \phi(M) is not contained in a proper affine subspace of V, and this immersion is unique up to affine equivalence.   Moreover, we show that any extrinsic symplectic immersion of M factors through to the full one by a symplectic reduction of the ambient space. In particular, this shows that the full immersion is characterized by having an ambient space V of minimal dimension.
