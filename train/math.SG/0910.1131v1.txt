We consider pairs of Lagrangian submanifolds (L_0,L), (L_1, L) belonging to the class of Lagrangian submanifolds with \emph{conic} ends on \emph{Weinstein manifolds}. The main purpose of the present paper is to define a canonical chain map h_\CL: CF(L_0,L) \to CF(L_1,L) of Lagrangian Floer complex inducing an isomorphism in homology, under the Hamiltonian isotopy \CL=\{L_s\}_{0 \leq s\leq 1} generated by \emph{conic} Hamiltonian functions such that the intersections L \cap L_s do not escape to infinity. The main ingredients of the proof is an a priori bound for general isotopy of the energy \emph{quadratic} at infinity and a C^0-bound for the \emph{C^1-small} isotopy \CL = \{L_s\}, for the associated pseudo-holomorphic map equations with \emph{moving} Lagrangian boundary induced by a conic Hamiltonian isotopy. For the Lagrangian submanifolds with \emph{asymptotically conic} ends, we construct a natural homomorphism h_\LL: HF(L_0,L) \to HF(L_1,L) for which the corresponding chain map may \emph{not} necessarily exist.   This provides a more conventional construction of the chain isomorphism which replaces the sophisticated method using the Lagrangian cobordism via the machinery of \cite{kasturi-oh1,kasturi-oh2} whose details were only outlined in \cite{oh:gokova}.
