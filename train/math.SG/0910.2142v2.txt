Bidouble covers \pi : S \mapsto Q of the quadric Q are parametrized by connected families depending on four positive integers a,b,c,d. In the special case where b=d we call them abc-surfaces.   Such a Galois covering \pi admits a small perturbation yielding a general 4-tuple covering of Q with branch curve \De, and a natural Lefschetz fibration obtained from a small perturbation of the composition of  \pi with the first projection.   We prove a more general result implying that the braid monodromy factorization corresponding to \De determines the three integers a,b,c in the case of abc-surfaces. We introduce a new method in order to distinguish factorizations which are not stably equivalent. This result is in sharp contrast with a previous result of the first and third author, showing that the mapping class group factorizations corresponding to the respective natural Lefschetz pencils are equivalent for abc-surfaces with the same values of a+c, b. This result hints at the possibility that abc-surfaces with fixed values of a+c, b, although diffeomorphic but not deformation equivalent, might be not canonically symplectomorphic.
