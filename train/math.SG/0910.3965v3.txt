In this paper, we show that the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o contact invariant c^+(\xi)\in HF^+(-Y) of a contact 3-manifold (Y,\xi) can be calculated combinatorially if Y is the boundary of a certain type of plumbing X, and \xi is induced by a Stein structure on X. Our technique uses an algorithm of Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o to determine the Heegaard-Floer homology of such 3-manifolds. We discuss two important applications of this technique in contact topology. First, we show that it simplifies the calculation of the Ozsv\'ath-Stipsicz-Szab\'o obstruction to admitting a planar open book. Then we define a numerical invariant of contact manifolds that respects a partial ordering induced by Stein cobordisms. We do a sample calculation showing that the invariant can get infinitely many distinct values.
