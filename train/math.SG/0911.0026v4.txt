The paper is a summary of the results of the authors concerning computations of symplectic invariants of Weinstein manifolds and contains some examples and applications. Proofs are sketched. The detailed proofs will appear in our forthcoming paper. In the Appendix written by S. Ganatra and M. Maydanskiy it is shown that the results of this paper imply P. Seidel's conjecture equating symplectic homology with Hochschild homology of a certain Fukaya category.
