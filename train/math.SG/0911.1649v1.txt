In the context of deformation quantization, there exist various procedures to deal with the quantization of a reduced space M_red. We shall be concerned here mainly with the classical Marsden-Weinstein reduction, assuming that we have a proper action of a Lie group G on a Poisson manifold M, with a moment map J for which zero is a regular value. For the quantization, we follow [BHW] (with a simplified approach) and build a star product *_red on M_red from a strongly invariant star product * on M. The new questions which are addressed in this paper concern the existence of natural *-involutions on the reduced quantum algebra and the representation theory for such a reduced *-algebra. We assume that * is Hermitian and we show that the choice of a formal series of smooth densities on the embedded coisotropic submanifold C = J^{-1}(0), with some equivariance property, defines a *-involution for *_red on the reduced space. Looking into the question whether the corresponding *-involution is the complex conjugation (which is a *-involution in the Marsden-Weinstein context) yields a new notion of quantized unimodular class. We introduce a left *-submodule and a right *_red-submodule C^\infty_cf(C)[[lambda]] of C^\infty(C)[[lambda]]; we define on it a C^\infty(M_red)[[lambda]]-valued inner product and we establish that this gives a strong Morita equivalence bimodule between C^\infty(M_red)[[lambda]] and the finite rank operators on C^\inftycf(C)[[lambda]]. The crucial point is here to show the complete positivity of the inner product. We obtain a Rieffel induction functor from the strongly non-degenerate *-representations of (C^\infty(M_red)[[lambda]], *_red) on pre-Hilbert right D-modules to those of (C^\infty(M)[[lambda]], *), for any auxiliary coefficient *-algebra D over \mathbb{C}[[lambda]].
