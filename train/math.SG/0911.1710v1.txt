In this paper, we prove that the tagent map of the holomorphic k- jet evaluation j^k_{hol} from the mapping space to holomorphic k-jet bundle, when restricted on the universal moduli space of simple J-holomorphic curves with one marked point, is surjective. From this we derive that for generic J, the moduli space of simple J-holomorphic curves in class \beta\in H_2(M) with general jet constraints at marked points is a smooth manifold of expected dimension.
