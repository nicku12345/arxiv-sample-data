We define an algebraic/combinatorial object on the front projection \Sigma of a Legendrian knot called a Morse complex sequence, abbreviated MCS. This object is motivated by the theory of generating families and provides new connections between generating families, normal rulings, and augmentations of the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA. In particular, we place an equivalence relation on the set of MCSs on \Sigma and construct a surjective map from the equivalence classes to the set of chain homotopy classes of augmentations of L_\Sigma, where L_\Sigma is the Ng resolution of \Sigma. In the case of Legendrian knot classes admitting representatives with two-bridge front projections, this map is bijective. We also exhibit two standard forms for MCSs and give explicit algorithms for finding these forms.
