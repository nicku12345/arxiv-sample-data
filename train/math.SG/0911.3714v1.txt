This is the first of a series of papers on foundations of Floer theory. We give an axiomatic treatment of the geometric notion of a semi-infinite cycle. Using this notion, we introduce a bordism version of Floer theory for the cotangent bundle of a compact manifold M. Our construction is geometric and does not require the compactness and gluing results traditionally used to setup Floer theory. Finally, we prove a bordism version of Viterbo's theorem relating Floer bordism of the cotangent bundle to the ordinary bordism groups of the free loop space of M.
