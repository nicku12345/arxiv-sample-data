In these notes, after an introduction to toric Kahler geometry, we present Calabi's family of U(n)-invariant extremal Kahler metrics in symplectic action-angle coordinates and show that it actually contains, as particular cases, many interesting cohomogeneity one examples of constant scalar curvature.
