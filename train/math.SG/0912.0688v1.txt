We extend the Falceto-Zambon version of Marsden-Ratiu Poisson reduction to Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis structures with background on manifolds. We define gauge transformations of Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis structures with background, study some of their properties and show that they are compatible with reduction procedure. We use gauge transformations to construct Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis structures with background.
