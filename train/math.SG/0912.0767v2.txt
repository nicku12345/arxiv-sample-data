We give a quick method of constructing strong homotopy associative algebra, namely, the higher derived product construction. This method is associative analogue of classical higher derived bracket construction in the category of Loday algebras. We introduce a new type of algebra "Loday pair" which is noncommutative analogue of classical Leibniz pair. We study strong homotopy Loday pairs and the higher derived brackets on the Loday pairs.
