A presymplectic structure on odd dimensional manifold is given by a closed 2-form which is nondegenerate, i.e., of maximal rank. We investigate geometry of presymplectic manifolds. Some basic theorems analogous to those in symplectic and contact topology are given and applied to study constructions of presymplectic manifolds. In particular, we describe how to glue presymplectic manifolds along a presymplectic submanifold, including surgery along a presymplectic circles.
