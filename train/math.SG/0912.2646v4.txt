The main purpose of the present paper is a study of orientations of the moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic discs with boundary lying on a \emph{real} Lagrangian submanifold, i.e., the fixed point set of an anti-symplectic involutions \tau on a symplectic manifold. We introduce the notion of \tau-relatively spin structure for an anti-symplectic involution \tau, and study how the orientations on the moduli space behave under the involution \tau. We also apply this to the study of Lagrangian Floer theory of real Lagrangian submanifolds. In particular, we study unobstructedness of the \tau-fixed point set of symplectic manifolds and in particular prove its unobstructedness in the case of Calabi-Yau manifolds. And we also do explicit calculation of Floer cohomology of \R P^{2n+1} over \Lambda_{0,nov}^{\Z} which provides an example whose Floer cohomology is not isomorphic to its classical cohomology. We study Floer cohomology of the diagonal of the square of a symplectic manifold, which leads to a rigorous construction of the quantum Massey product of symplectic manifold in complete generality.
