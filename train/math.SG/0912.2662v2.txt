A survey of finite group actions on symplectic 4-manifolds is given with a special emphasis on results and questions concerning smooth or symplectic classification of group actions, group actions and exotic smooth structures, and homological rigidity and boundedness of group actions. We also take this opportunity to include several results and questions which did not appear elsewhere.
