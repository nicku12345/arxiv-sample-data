We compute, by two methods, the genus one degree zero orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants with non-stacky insertions which are exceptional cases of the dilaton and divisor equations. One method involves a detailed analysis of the relevant moduli spaces. The other method, valid in the presence of torus actions with isolated fixed points, is virtual localization. These computations verify the conjectural evaluations of these invariants. Some genus one twisted orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants are also computed.
