We introduce the concept of twisted contact groupoids, as an extension either of contact groupoids or of twisted symplectic ones, and we discuss the integration of twisted Jacobi manifolds by twisted contact groupoids. We also investigate the very close relationships which link homogeneous twisted Poisson manifolds with twisted Jacobi manifolds and homogeneous twisted symplectic groupoids with twisted contact ones. Some examples for each structure are presented.
