This (partially expository) paper discusses Lagrangian Floer cohomology in the context of Lefschetz fibrations, with emphasis on the algebraic structures encountered there. In addition to the well-known directed A_infinity algebras which appear in this situation, one has additional information encoded in a certain bimodule homomorphism. There are two approaches to constructing this homomorphism: in terms of the (noncompact) Lefschetz thimbles in the total space, or else in terms of vanishing cycle in the fibre. We prove a comparison result, which shows that (up to a certain remaining ambiguity) the two approaches are equivalent.
