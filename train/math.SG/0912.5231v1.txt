We prove that there is a unique real tight contact structure on the 3-ball with convex boundary up to isotopy through real tight contact structures. We also give a partial classification of the real tight solid tori with the real structure being antipodal map along longitudinal and the identity along meridional direction. For the proofs, we use the real versions of contact neighborhood theorems and the invariant convex surface theory in real contact manifolds.
