In this article, we study the rational cohomology rings of Voisin's punctual Hilbert schemes X^{[n]} associated to a symplectic compact fourfold X. We prove that these rings can be universally constructed from H^*(X,\mathbb{Q}) and c_1(X), and that Ruan's crepant resolution conjecture holds if c_1(X) is a torsion class. Next, we prove that for any almost-complex compact fourfold X, the complex cobordism class of X^{[n]} depends only on the cobordism class of X.
