For the resolved conifold with one outer D-brane in arbitrary framing, we present some results for the open string partition functions obtained by some operator manipulations. We prove some conjectures by Aganagic-Vafa and Aganagic-Klemm-Vafa that relates such invariants to the mirror curve of the resolved conifold. This establishes local mirror symmetry for the resolved confolds for holomorphic disc invariants. We also verify an integrality conjecture of such invariants by Ooguri-Vafa in this case and present closed formulas for some Ooguri-Vafa type invariants in genus 0 and arbitrary genera.
