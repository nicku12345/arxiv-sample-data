Let G be a connected reductive group acting on an irreducible normal algebraic variety X. We give a slightly improved version of local structure theorems obtained by F.Knop and D.A.Timashev that describe an action of some parabolic subgroup of G on an open subset of X. We also extend various results of E.B.Vinberg and D.A.Timashev on the set of horospheres in X.   We construct a family of nongeneric horospheres in X and a variety \Hor parameterizing this family, such that there is a rational G-equivariant symplectic covering of cotangent vector bundles T^*\Hor \dashrightarrow T^*X. As an application we get a description of the image of the moment map of T^*X obtained by F.Knop by means of geometric methods that do not involve differential operators.
