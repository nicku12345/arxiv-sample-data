We consider contact structures on simply-connected 5-manifolds which arise as circle bundles over simply-connected symplectic 4-manifolds and show that invariants from contact homology are related to the divisibility of the canonical class of the symplectic structure. As an application we find new examples of inequivalent contact structures in the same equivalence class of almost contact structures with non-zero first Chern class.
