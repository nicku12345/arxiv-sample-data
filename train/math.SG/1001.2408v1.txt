These notes of a course given at IRMA in April 2009 cover some aspects of the representation theory of fundamental groups of manifolds of dimension at most 3 in compact Lie groups, mainly \su. We give detailed examples, develop the techniques of twisted cohomology and gauge theory. We review Chern-Simons theory and describe an integrable system for the representation space of a surface. Finally, we explain some basic ideas on geometric quantization. We apply them to the case of representation spaces by computing Bohr-Sommerfeld orbits with metaplectic correction.
