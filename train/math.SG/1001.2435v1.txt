We present reformulation of Mathieu's result on representing cohomology classes of symplectic manifold with symplectically harmonic forms. We apply it to the case of foliated manifolds with transversally symplectic structure and to symplectic orbifolds. We obtain in particular that such representation is always possible for compact K\"{a}hler orbifolds.
