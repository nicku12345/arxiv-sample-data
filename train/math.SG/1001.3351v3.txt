We study the local symplectic algebra of curves. We use the method of algebraic restrictions to classify symplectic T_7 singularities. We define discrete symplectic invariants - the Lagrangian tangency orders. We use these invariants to distinguish symplectic singularities of classical A-D-E singularities of planar curves, S_5 singularity and T_7 singularity. We also give the geometric description of these symplectic singularities.
