We introduce the notion of a tropical coamoeba which gives a combinatorial description of the Fukaya category of the mirror of a toric Fano stack. We show that the polyhedral decomposition of a real n-torus into (n + 1) permutohedra gives a tropical coamoeba for the mirror of the projective space, and prove a torus-equivariant version of homological mirror symmetry for the projective space. As a corollary, we obtain homological mirror symmetry for toric orbifolds of the projective space.
