Consider the cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold (M,g) of dimension 2 or more, endowed with a twisted symplectic structure defined by a closed weakly exact 2-form \sigma on M whose lift to the universal cover of M admits a bounded primitive. We compute the Rabinowitz Floer homology of energy hypersurfaces \Sigma_{k}=H^{-1}(k) of mechanical (kinetic energy + potential) Hamiltonians H for the case when the energy value k is greater than the Mane critical value c.   Under the stronger condition that k>c_{0}, where c_{0} denotes the strict Mane critical value, Abbondandolo and Schwarz recently computed the Rabinowitz Floer homology of such hypersurfaces, by means of a short exact sequence of chain complexes involving the Rabinowitz Floer chain complex and the Morse (co)chain complex associated to the free time action functional. We extend their results to the weaker case k>c, thus covering cases where \sigma is not exact.   As a consequence, we deduce that the hypersurface corresponding to the energy level k is never displaceable for any k>c. Moreover, we prove that if dim M > 1, the homology of the free loop space of M is infinite dimensional, and if the metric is chosen generically, a generic Hamiltonian diffeomorphism has infinitely many leaf-wise intersection points in \Sigma_{k}.
