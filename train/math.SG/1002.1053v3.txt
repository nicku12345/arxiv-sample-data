We study various aspects of the metaplectic Howe duality realized by Fischer decomposition for the metaplectic representation space of polynomials on \mathbb{R}^{2n} valued in the Segal-Shale-Weil representation. As a consequence, we determine symplectic monogenics, i.e., the space of polynomial solutions of the symplectic Dirac operator.
