In this paper, we generalize construction of Seidel's long exact sequence of Lagrangian Floer cohomology to that of compact Lagrangian submanifolds with vanishing Malsov class on general Calabi-Yau manifolds. We use the framework of anchored Lagrangian submanifolds developed in \cite{fooo:anchor} and some compactness theorem of \emph{smooth} J-holomorphic sections of Lefschetz Hamiltonian fibration for a generic choice of J. The proof of the latter compactness theorem involves a study of proper pseudoholomorphic curves in the setting of noncompact symplectic manifolds with cylindrical ends.
