In 1997, Chekanov gave the first example of a Legendrian nonsimple knot type: the m(5_2) knot. Epstein, Fuchs, and Meyer extended his result by showing that there are at least n different Legendrian representatives with maximal Thurston--Bennequin number of the twist knot K_{-2n} with crossing number 2n+1. In this paper we give a complete classification of Legendrian and transverse representatives of twist knots. In particular, we show that K_{-2n} has exactly \lceil\frac{n^2}2\rceil Legendrian representatives with maximal Thurston--Bennequin number, and \lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil transverse representatives with maximal self-linking number. Our techniques include convex surface theory, Legendrian ruling invariants, and Heegaard Floer homology.
