We propose a definition of Jacobi quasi-Nijenhuis algebroid and show that any such Jacobi algebroid has an associated quasi-Jacobi bialgebroid. Therefore, also an associated Courant-Jacobi algebroid is obtained. We introduce the notions of quasi-Jacobi bialgebroid morphism and Courant-Jacobi algebroid morphism providing also some examples of Courant-Jacobi algebroid morphisms.
