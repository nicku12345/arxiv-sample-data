In her PhD thesis Milin developed an equivariant version of the contact homology groups constructed by Eliashberg, Kim and Polterovich and used it to prove an equivariant contact non-squeezing theorem. In this article we re-obtain the same result in the setting of generating functions, starting from the homology groups studied in arXiv:0901.3112. As Milin showed, this result implies orderability of lens spaces.
