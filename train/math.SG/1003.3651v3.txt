In this article, we consider the Floer cohomology (with \Z_2 coefficients) between torus fibers and the real Lagrangian in Fano toric manifolds. We first investigate the conditions under which the Floer cohomology is defined, and then develop a combinatorial description of the Floer complex based on the polytope of the toric manifold. We show that if the Floer cohomology is defined, and the Floer cohomology of the torus fiber is non-zero, then the Floer cohomology of the pair is non-zero. We use this result to develop some applications to non-displaceability and the minimum number of intersection points under Hamiltonian isotopy.
