In this article we study the differential graded algebra (DGA) invariant associated to Legendrian knots in tight lens spaces. Given a grid number one diagram for a knot in L(p, q), we show how to construct a special Lagrangian diagram suitable for computing the DGA invariant for the Legendrian knot specified by the diagram. We then specialize to L(p, p - 1) and show that for two families of knots, the existence of an augmentation of the DGA depends solely on the value of p.
