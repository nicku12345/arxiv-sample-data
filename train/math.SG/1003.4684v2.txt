We consider Open Gromov-Witten invariants for noncompact Calabi-Yau in the case the Lagrangian has the topology of \R^2 \times S^1. The definition of the invariant involves the choice of a frame for the Lagrangian, in accord with string theory.   Our result applies to the examples arising from Large N-duality. In particular it leads to knot and link invariants counting holomorphic curves.
