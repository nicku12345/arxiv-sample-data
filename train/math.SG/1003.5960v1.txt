We construct monotone Lagrangian tori in the standard symplectic vector space, in the complex projective space and in products of spheres. We explain how to classify these Lagrangian tori up to symplectomorphism and Hamiltonian isotopy, and how to show that they are not displaceable by Hamiltonian isotopies.
