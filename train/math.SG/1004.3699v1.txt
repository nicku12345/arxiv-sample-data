The aim of the present paper is to investigate new classes of symplectically fat fibre bundles. We prove a general existence theorem for fat vectors with respect to the canonical invariant connections. Based on this result we give new proofs of some constructions of symplectic structures. This includes twistor bundles and locally homogeneous complex manifolds. The proofs are conceptually simpler and allow for obtaining more general results.
