This paper and its sequel prove that every Legendrian knot in a closed three-manifold with a contact form has a Reeb chord. The present paper deduces this result from another theorem, asserting that an exact symplectic cobordism between contact 3-manifolds induces a map on (filtered) embedded contact homology satisfying certain axioms. The latter theorem will be proved in the sequel using Seiberg-Witten theory.
