Let (M,\omega) be a symplectic manifold admitting a metaplectic structure (a symplectic analogue of the Riemannian spin structure) and a torsion-free symplectic connection \nabla. Symplectic Killing spinor fields for this structure are sections of the symplectic spinor bundle satisfying a certain first order partial differential equation and they are the main topic of this paper.   We derive a necessary condition satisfied by a symplectic Killing spinor field. The advantage of this condition consists in the fact that it is expressed by a zeroth order operator. This condition helps us substantionally to compute the symplectic Killing spinor fields for the standard symplectic vector spaces and the round sphere S^2 equipped with the volume form of the round metric.
