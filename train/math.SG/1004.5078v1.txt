This paper is devoted to the study of Morita equivalence for twisted Poisson manifolds. We review some Morita invariants and prove that integrable twisted Poisson manifolds which are gauge equivalent are Morita equivalent. Moreover, we introduce the notion of weak Morita equivalence and show that if two twisted Poisson manifolds are weak Morita equivalent, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between their twisted symplectic leaves.
