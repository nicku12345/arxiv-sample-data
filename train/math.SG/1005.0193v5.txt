Let (M, \omega) be a 6-dimensional closed symplectic manifold with a symplectic S^1-action with M^{S^1} \neq \emptyset and \dim M^{S^1} \leq 2. Assume that \omega is integral with a generalized moment map \mu. We first prove that the action is Hamiltonian if and only if b_2^+(M_{\red})=1, where M_{\red} is any reduced space with respect to \mu. It means that if the action is non-Hamiltonian, then b_2^+(M_{\red}) \geq 2. Secondly, we focus on the case when the action is semifree and Hamiltonian. We prove that if M^{S^1} consists of surfaces, then the number k of fixed surfaces with positive genera is at most four. In particular, if the extremal fixed surfaces are spheres, then k is at most one. Finally, we prove that k \neq 2 and we construct some examples of 6-dimensional semifree Hamiltonian S^1-manifolds such that M^{S^1} contains k surfaces of positive genera for k = 0 and 4. Examples with k=1 and 3 were given in \cite{L2}.
