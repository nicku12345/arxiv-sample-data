In this note we complete the discussion of minimality of symplectic fiber sums. We find, that for fiber sums along spheres the minimality of the sum is determined by the cases discussed by M. Usher and one additional case: If the sum is the result of the rational blow-down of a symplectic -4-sphere in X, then it is non-minimal if X contains a certain configuration of exceptional spheres in relation to this -4-sphere.
