In this paper we show that any good toric contact manifold has well defined cylindrical contact homology and describe how it can be combinatorially computed from the associated moment cone. As an application we compute the cylindrical contact homology of a particularly nice family of examples that appear in the work of Gauntlett-Martelli-Sparks-Waldram on Sasaki-Einstein metrics. We show in particular that these give rise to a new infinite family of non-equivalent contact structures on S^2 \times S^{3} in the unique homotopy class of almost contact structures with vanishing first Chern class.
