We prove the bounded isometry conjecture of F. Lalonde and L. Polterovich for a special class of closed symplectic manifolds. As a byproduct, it is shown that the flux group of a product of these special symplectic manifold is isomorphic to the direct sum of the flux group of each symplectic manifold.
