Rabinowitz Floer homology has been investigated on a submanifold of contact type. The contact condition, however, is quite restrictive. For example, a product of contact hypersurfaces is rarely of contact type. In this article, we study Rabinowitz Floer homology for a class of non-contact submanifolds. We show for this example that there are infinitely many leafwise intersection points by proving a K\"unneth formula for Rabinowitz Floer homology.
