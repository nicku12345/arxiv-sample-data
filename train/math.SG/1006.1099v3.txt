There is a classical relationship in algebraic geometry between a hyperelliptic curve and an associated pencil of quadric hypersurfaces. We investigate symplectic aspects of this relationship, with a view to applications in low-dimensional topology. We construct a derived equivalence between the Fukaya category of a curve and the nilpotent summand of the Fukaya category of the associated complete intersection of two quadrics. This essentially determines the instanton Floer homology of a 3-manifold fibred by genus two curves.
