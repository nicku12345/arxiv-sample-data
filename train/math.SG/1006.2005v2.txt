The Runge approximation theorem for holomorphic maps (U -> C) is a fundamental result in complex analysis. The aim of this article is to prove such a result for (pseudo-)holomorphic maps from a compact Riemann surface to a compact (almost-)complex manifold M under certain assumptions. Though the setting is definitively that of pseudo-holomorphic maps it also covers some complex varieties.
