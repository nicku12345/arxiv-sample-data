We study symplectic geometry of rationally connected 3-folds. The first result shows that rationally connectedness is a symplectic deformation invariant in dimension 3. If a rationally connected 3-fold X is Fano or b_2(X)=2, we prove that it is symplectic rationally connected, i.e. there is a non-zero Gromov-Witten invariant with two insertions being the class of a point. Finally we prove that many rationally connected 3-folds are birational to a symplectic rationally connected variety.
