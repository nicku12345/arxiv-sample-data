The quantum homology of the monotone complex quadric surface splits into the sum of two fields. We outline a proof of the following statement: The unities of these fields give rise to distinct symplectic quasi-states defined by asymptotic spectral invariants. In fact, these quasi-states turn out to be "supported" on disjoint Lagrangian submanifolds. Our method involves a spectral sequence which starts at homology of the loop space of the 2-sphere and whose higher differentials are computed via symplectic field theory, in particular with the help of the Bourgeois-Oancea exact sequence.
