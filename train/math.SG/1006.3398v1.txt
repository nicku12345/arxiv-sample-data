We establish a new version of Floer homology for monotone Lagrangian submanifolds and apply it to prove the following (generalized) version of Audin's conjecture : if L is an aspherical manifold which admits a monotone Lagrangian embedding in {\bf C^{n}}, then its Maslov number equals 2. We also prove other results on the topology of monotone Lagrangian submanifolds L\subset M of maximal Maslov number under the hypothesis that they are displaceable through a Hamiltonian isotopy.
