We prove that open Gromov-Witten invariants for semi-Fano toric manifolds of the form X=\mathbb{P}(K_Y\oplus\mathcal{O}_Y), where Y is a toric Fano manifold, are equal to certain 1-pointed closed Gromov-Witten invariants of X. As applications, we compute the mirror superpotentials for these manifolds. In particular, this gives a simple proof for the formula of the mirror superpotential for the Hirzebruch surface \mathbb{F}_2.
