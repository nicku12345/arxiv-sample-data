We investigate mirror symmetry for toric Calabi-Yau manifolds from the perspective of the SYZ conjecture. Starting with a non-toric special Lagrangian torus fibration on a toric Calabi-Yau manifold X, we construct a complex manifold \check{X} using T-duality modified by quantum corrections. These corrections are encoded by Fourier transforms of generating functions of certain open Gromov-Witten invariants. We conjecture that this complex manifold \check{X}, which belongs to the Hori-Iqbal-Vafa mirror family, is inherently written in canonical flat coordinates. In particular, we obtain an enumerative meaning for the (inverse) mirror maps, and this gives a geometric reason for why their Taylor series expansions in terms of the K\"ahler parameters of X have integral coefficients. Applying the results in \cite{Chan10} and \cite{LLW10}, we compute the open Gromov-Witten invariants in terms of local BPS invariants and give evidences of our conjecture for several 3-dimensional examples including K_{\proj^2} and K_{\proj^1\times\proj^1}.
