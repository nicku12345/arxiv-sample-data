We calculate the sutured version of cylindrical contact homology of a sutured contact solid torus (S^1\times D^2,\Gamma, \xi), where \Gamma consists of 2n parallel sutures of arbitrary slope and \xi is a universally tight contact structure. In particular, we show that it is non-zero. This computation is one of the first computations of the sutured version of cylindrical contact homology and does not follow from computations in the closed case.
