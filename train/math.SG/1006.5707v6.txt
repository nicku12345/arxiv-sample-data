In this note we introduce the notion of a smooth structure on a conical pseudomanifold M in terms of C^\infty-rings of smooth functions on M. For a finitely generated smooth structure C^\infty (M) we introduce the notion of the Nash tangent bundle, the Zariski tangent bundle, the tangent bundle of M, and the notion of characteristic classes of M. We prove the vanishing of a Nash vector field at a singular point for a special class of Euclidean smooth structures on M. We introduce the notion of a conical symplectic form on M and show that it is smooth with respect to a Euclidean smooth structure on M. If a conical symplectic structure is also smooth with respect to a compatible Poisson smooth structure C^\infty (M), we show that its Brylinski-Poisson homology groups coincide with the de Rham homology groups of M. We show nontrivial examples of these smooth conical symplectic-Poisson pseudomanifolds.
