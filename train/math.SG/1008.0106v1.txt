We present a geometric construction of central extensions of covering groups of the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms, integrating central extensions of the Lie algebra of divergence free vector fields defined by Lichnerowicz cocycles. Certain covering spaces of non-linear Grassmannians can be realized as prequantizable coadjoint orbits in these Lie group extensions.
