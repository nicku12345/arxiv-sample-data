We show that the pre-order defined on the category of contact manifolds by arbitrary symplectic cobordisms is considerably less rigid than its counterparts for exact or Stein cobordisms: in particular, we exhibit large new classes of contact 3-manifolds which are symplectically cobordant to something overtwisted, or to the tight 3-sphere, or which admit symplectic caps containing symplectically embedded spheres with vanishing self-intersection. These constructions imply new and simplified proofs of several recent results involving fillability, planarity and non-separating contact type embeddings. The cobordisms are built from generalized symplectic handles which have cores that are arbitrary symplectic surfaces with boundary and co-cores that are symplectic disks or annuli; these can be attached to contact 3-manifolds along sufficiently large neighborhoods of transverse links or pre-Lagrangian tori. We also sketch a construction of J-holomorphic foliations in these cobordisms and formulate a conjecture regarding maps induced on Embedded Contact Homology with twisted coefficients.
