This is the first of a series of papers devoted to proving the equivalence of Heegaard Floer homology and embedded contact homology (abbreviated ECH). In this paper we prove that, given a closed, oriented, contact 3-manifold, there is an equivalence between ECH of the closed 3-manifold and a version of ECH, defined on the complement of the binding of an adapted open book decomposition. In the appendix we give a full proof of the Morse-Bott gluing result that we need in this article and in the subsequent ones of the series proving the isomorphism between Heegaard Floer homology and ECH. V.7: minor errors fixed and exposition improved in the appendix.
