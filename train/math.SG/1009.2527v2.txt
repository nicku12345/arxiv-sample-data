We extend the Local-to-Global-Principle used in the proof of convexity theorems for momentum maps to not necessarily closed maps whose target space carries a convexity structure which need not be based on a metric. Using a new factorization of the momentum map, convexity of its image is proved without local fiber connectedness, and for almost arbitrary spaces of definition. Geodesics are obtained by straightening rather than shortening of arcs, which allows a unified treatment and extension of previous convexity results.
