We discuss a symplectic counterpart of the theory of stacky fans. First, we define a stacky polytope and construct the symplectic Deligne-Mumford stack associated to the stacky polytope. Then we establish a relation between stacky polytopes and stacky fans: the stack associated to a stacky polytope is equivalent to the stack associated to a stacky fan if the stacky fan corresponds to the stacky polytope.
