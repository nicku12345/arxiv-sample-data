In this note we study two index questions. In the first we establish the relationship between the Morse indices of the free time action functional and the fixed time action functional. The second is related to Rabinowitz Floer homology. Our index computations are based on a correction term which is defined as follows: around a non-degenerate Hamiltonian orbit lying in a fixed energy level a well-known theorem says that one can find a whole cylinder of orbits parametrized by the energy. The correction term is determined by whether the periods of the orbits are increasing or decreasing as one moves up the orbit cylinder. We also provide an example to show that, even above the Ma\~n\'e critical value, the periods may be increasing thus producing a jump in the Morse index of the free time action functional in relation to the Morse index of the fixed time action functional.
