We investigate a two-cocycle on the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms of an exact symplectic manifolds defined by Ismagilov, Losik, and Michor and investigate its properties. We provide both vanishing and non-vanishing results and applications to foliated symplectic bundles and to Hamiltonian actions of finitely generated groups.
