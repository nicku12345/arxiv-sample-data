In the first part of this paper, we obtain mirror formulas for twisted genus 0 two-point Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants of projective spaces and for the genus 0 two-point GW-invariants of Fano and Calabi-Yau complete intersections. This extends previous results for projective hypersurfaces, following the same approach, but we also completely describe the structure coefficients in both cases and obtain relations between these coefficients that are vital to the applications to mirror symmetry in the rest of this paper. In the second and third parts of this paper, we confirm Walcher's mirror symmetry conjectures for the annulus and Klein bottle GW-invariants of Calabi-Yau complete intersection threefolds; these applications are the main results of this paper. In a separate paper, the genus~0 two-point formulas are used to obtain mirror formulas for the genus~1 GW-invariants of all Calabi-Yau complete intersections.
