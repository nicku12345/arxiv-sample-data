Let the circle act effectively in a Hamiltonian fashion on a compact symplectic manifold (M, \omega). Assume that the fixed point set M^{S^1} has exactly two components, X and Y, and that \dim(X) + \dim(Y) +2 = \dim(M). We first show that X, Y and M are simply connected. Then we show that, up to S^1-equivariant diffeomorphism, there are finitely many such manifolds in each dimension. Moreover, we show that in low dimensions, the manifold is unique in a certain category. We use techniques from both areas of symplectic geometry and geometric topology.
