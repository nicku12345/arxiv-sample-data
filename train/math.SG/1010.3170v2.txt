We prove that a bounded domain \Omega in \R^n with smooth boundary has a periodic billiard trajectory with at most n+1 bounce times and of length less than C_n r(\Omega), where C_n is a positive constant which depends only on n, and r(\Omega) is the supremum of radius of balls in \Omega. This result improves the result by C.Viterbo, which asserts that \Omega has a periodic billiard trajectory of length less than C'_n \vol(\Omega)^{1/n}. To prove this result, we study symplectic capacity of Liouville domains, which is defined via symplectic homology.
