Using the Atiyah class we give a criterion for a vector bundle on a coisotropic subvariety, Y, of an algebraic Poisson variety X to admit a first and second order noncommutative deformation. We also show noncommutative deformations of a vector bundle are governed by a curved dg Lie algebra which reduces to the classical relative Hochschild complex when the Poisson structure on X is trivial.
