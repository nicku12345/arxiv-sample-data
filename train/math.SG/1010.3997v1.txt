We present an atlas of Legendrian knots in standard contact three-space. This gives a conjectural Legendrian classification for all knots with arc index at most 9, including alternating knots through 7 crossings and nonalternating knots through 9 crossings. Our method involves a computer search of grid diagrams and applies to transverse knots as well. The atlas incorporates a number of new, small examples of phenomena such as transverse nonsimplicity and non-maximal non-destabilizable Legendrian knots, and gives rise to new infinite families of transversely nonsimple knots.
