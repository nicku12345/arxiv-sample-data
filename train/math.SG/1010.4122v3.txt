It is known that every compact Stein 4-manifolds can be embedded into a simply connected, minimal, closed, symplectic 4-manifold. By using this property, we discuss a new method of constructing corks. This method generates a large class of new corks including all the previously known ones. We prove that every one of these corks can knot infinitely many different ways in a closed smooth manifold, by showing that cork twisting along them gives different exotic smooth structures. We also give an example of infinitely many disjoint embeddings of a fixed cork into a non-compact 4-manifold which produce infinitely many exotic smooth structures. Furthermore, we construct arbitrary many simply connected compact codimension zero submanifolds of S^4 which are mutually homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic.
