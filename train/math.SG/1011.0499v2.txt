Given a link in the three-sphere, Z. Szab\'o and the second author constructed a spectral sequence starting at the Khovanov homology of the link and converging to the Heegaard Floer homology of its branched double-cover. The aim of this paper and its sequel is to explicitly calculate this spectral sequence, using bordered Floer homology. There are two primary ingredients in this computation: an explicit calculation of filtered bimodules associated to Dehn twists and a pairing theorem for polygons. In this paper we give the first ingredient, and so obtain a combinatorial spectral sequence from Khovanov homology to Heegaard Floer homology; in the sequel we show that this spectral sequence agrees with the previously known one.
