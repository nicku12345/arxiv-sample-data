In this paper we prove a symmetry result on submanifolds of codimension one in a n + 1-dimensional space form, related to the geodesic distance function and to the normal curvature of some fixed vector field. As applications we will prove sphere characterization type theorems for Kahler manifolds endowed with a toric group action.
