The Local-to-Global-Principle used in the proof of convexity theorems for momentum maps has been extracted as a statement of pure topology enriched with a structure of convexity. We extend this principle to not necessarily closed maps f\colon X\ra Y where the convexity structure of the target space Y need not be based on a metric. Using a new factorization of f, convexity of the image is proved without local fiber connectedness, and for arbitrary connected spaces X.
