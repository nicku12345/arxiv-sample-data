For a Fedosov manifold (symplectic manifold equipped with a symplectic torsion-free affine connection \nabla) admitting a metaplectic structure, we shall investigate two sequences of first order differential operators acting on sections of certain bundles over this manifold. The operators are symplectic analogues of the twistor operators known from Riemannian spin geometry. Therefore we call the mentioned sequences symplectic twistor sequences. These sequences are complexes if the connection \nabla is of Ricci type. We shall prove that the so called truncated parts of these complexes are elliptic. This establishes a background for a future analytic study.
