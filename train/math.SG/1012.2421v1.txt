We define a differential graded algebra associated to Legendrian knots in Seifert fibered spaces with transverse contact structures. This construction is distinguished from other combinatorial realizations of contact homology invariants by the existence of orbifold points in the Reeb orbit space of the contact manifold. These orbifold points are images of the exceptional fibers of the Seifert fibered manifold, and they play a key role in the definitions of the differential and the grading, as well as the proof of invariance. We apply the invariant to distinguish Legendrian knots whose homology is torsion and whose underlying topological knot types are isotopic; such examples exist in any sufficiently complicated contact Seifert fibered space.
