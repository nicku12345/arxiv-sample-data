We derive symmetries and adjunction inequalities of the knot Floer homology groups which appear to be especially interesting for homologically essential knots. Furthermore, we obtain an adjunction inequality for cobordism maps in knot Floer homologies. We demonstrate the adjunction inequalities and symmetries in explicit calculations which recover some of the main results from [1] on longitude Floer homology and also give rise to vanishing results on knot Floer homologies. Furthermore, using symmetries we prove that the knot Floer homology of a fiber distinguishes \stwo\times\sone from other \sone-bundles over surfaces.
