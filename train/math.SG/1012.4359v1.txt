This note explains how to relate some contact geometric operations, such as surgery, to operations on an underlying contact open book. In particular, we shall give a simple proof of the fact that stabilizations of contact open books yield contactomorphic manifolds. Let us remark that the results in this note are all well known to experts. This note just aims to provide some references for these results.
