We define a new variant of Rabinowitz Floer homology that is particularly well suited to studying the growth rate of leaf-wise intersections. We prove that for closed manifolds M whose loop space is "complicated", if \Sigma is a non-degenerate fibrewise starshaped hypersurface in T^*M and \phi is a generic Hamiltonian diffeomorphism then the number of leaf-wise intersection points of \phi in \Sigma grows exponentially in time. Concrete examples of such manifolds M are the connected sum of two copies of S^2 \times S^2, the connected sum of T^4 and CP^2, or any surface of genus greater than one.
