We study the local symplectic algebra of the 1-dimensional isolated complete intersection singularity of type S{\mu}. We use the method of algebraic restrictions to classify symplectic S{\mu} singularities. We distinguish these symplectic singularities by discrete symplectic invariants. We also give the geometric description of them.
