An f-structure on a manifold M is an endomorphism field \phi\in\Gamma(M,\End(TM)) such that \phi^3+\phi=0. Any f-structure \phi determines an almost CR structure E_{1,0}\subset T_\C M given by the +i-eigenbundle of \phi. Using a compatible metric g and connection \nabla on M, we construct an odd first-order differential operator D, acting on sections of \S=\Lambda E_{0,1}^*, whose principal symbol is of the type considered in arXiv:0810.0338. In the special case of a CR-integrable almost \S-structure, we show that when \nabla is the generalized Tanaka-Webster connection of Lotta and Pastore, the operator D is given by D = \sqrt{2}(\dbbar+\dbbar^*), where \dbbar is the tangential Cauchy-Riemann operator.   We then describe two "quantizations" of manifolds with f-structure that reduce to familiar methods in symplectic geometry in the case that \phi is a compatible almost complex structure, and to the contact quantization defined in \cite{F4} when \phi comes from a contact metric structure. The first is an index-theoretic approach involving the operator D; for certain group actions D will be transversally elliptic, and using the results in arXiv:0810.0338, we can give a Riemann-Roch type formula for its index. The second approach uses an analogue of the polarized sections of a prequantum line bundle, with a CR structure playing the role of a complex polarization.
