This paper is about the rigidity of compact group actions in the Poisson context. The main resut is that Hamiltonian actions of compact semisimple type are rigid. We prove it via a Nash-Moser normal form theorem for closed subgroups of SCI-type. This Nash-Moser normal form has other applications to stability results that we will explore in a future paper. We also review some classical rigidity results for differentiable actions of compact Lie groups and export it to the case of symplectic actions of compact Lie groups on symplectic manifolds.
