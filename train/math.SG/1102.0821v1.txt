Let M be a closed 4-manifold with a free circle action. If the orbit manifold N^3 satisfies an appropriate fibering condition, then we show how to represent a cone in H^2(M;\R) by symplectic forms. This generalizes earlier constructions by Thurston, Bouyakoub and Fern\'andez-Gray-Morgan. In the case that M is the product 4-manifold S^1\times N our construction complements the results of \cite{FV08} (arXiv:0805:1234 [math.GT]) and allows us to completely determine the symplectic cone of such 4-manifolds. The content of this paper partly overlaps with the content of the unpublished preprint "Symplectic 4-manifolds with a free circle action" (arXiv:0801.1313 [math.GT]).
