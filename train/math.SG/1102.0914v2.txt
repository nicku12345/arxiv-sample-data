For g>0, we construct g+1 Legendrian embeddings of a surface of genus g into J^1(R^2)=R^5 which lie in pairwise distinct Legendrian isotopy classes and which all have g+1 transverse Reeb chords (g+1 is the conjecturally minimal number of chords). Furthermore, for g of the g+1 embeddings the Legendrian contact homology DGA does not admit any augmentation over Z/2Z, and hence cannot be linearized. We also investigate these surfaces from the point of view of the theory of generating families. Finally, we consider Legendrian spheres and planes in J^1(S^2) from a similar perspective.
