We investigate the equivariant cohomology of the natural torus action on a K-contact manifold and its relation to the topology of the Reeb flow. Using the contact moment map, we show that the equivariant cohomology of this action is Cohen-Macaulay, which is a generalization of equivariant formality for torus actions without fixed points. As a consequence, a generic component of the contact moment map is a perfect Morse-Bott function for the basic cohomology of the orbit foliation F of the Reeb flow. Assuming that the closed Reeb orbits are isolated, we show that the basic cohomology of F is trivial in odd degrees, and its dimension equals the number of closed Reeb orbits. We characterize the K-contact manifolds with minimal number of closed Reeb orbits as real cohomology spheres. We also prove a GKM type theorem for K-contact manifolds, which allows us to calculate the equivariant cohomology algebra of K-contact manifolds in presence of the nonisolated GKM condition.
