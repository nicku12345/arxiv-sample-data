To every closed subset X of a symplectic manifold (M,\omega) we associate a natural group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms Ham(X,\omega). We equip this group with a semi-norm \Vert\cdot\Vert^{X,\omega}, generalizing the Hofer norm. We discuss Ham(X,\omega) and \Vert\cdot\Vert^{X,\omega} if X is a symplectic or isotropic submanifold. The main result involves the relative Hofer diameter of X in M. Its first part states that for the unit sphere in R^{2n} this diameter is bounded below by \frac\pi2, if n\geq2. Its second part states that for n\geq2 and d\geq n+1 there exists a compact set in R^{2n} of Hausdorff dimension at most d, with relative Hofer diameter bounded below by \pi/k(n,d), where k(n,d) is an explicitly defined integer.
