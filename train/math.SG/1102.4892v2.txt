Let (M,\omega) be a symplectic manifold and U\subseteq M an open subset. I study the natural inclusion of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of U into the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of M. The main result is an upper bound for this map in terms of the Hofer norms for U and M. Applications are upper bounds on the relative Hofer diameter of U and the asymptotic Hofer-Lipschitz constant, which are often sharp up to constant factors. As another consequence, the relative Hofer diameter of certain symplectic submanifolds vanishes.
