We study holomorphic supercurves, which are motivated by supergeometry as a natural generalisation of holomorphic curves. We prove that, upon perturbing the defining equations by making them depend on a connection, the corresponding linearised operator is generically surjective. By this transversality result, we show that the resulting moduli spaces are oriented finite dimensional smooth manifolds. Finally, we examine how they depend on the choice of generic data.
