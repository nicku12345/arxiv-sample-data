We show that the generalized K\"ahler-Ricci soliton equation on 4-dimensional toric K\"ahler orbifolds reduces to ODEs assuming there is a Hamiltonian 2-form. This leads to an explicit resolution of this equation on labeled triangles and convex labeled quadrilaterals. In particular, we give the explicit expression of the K\"ahler-Ricci solitons of weighted projective planes as well as new examples.
