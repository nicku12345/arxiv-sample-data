We prove homological mirror symmetry for the quintic Calabi-Yau 3-fold. The proof follows that for the quartic surface by Seidel (arXiv:math/0310414) closely, and uses a result of Sheridan (arXiv:1012.3238). In contrast to Sheridan's approach (arXiv:1111.0632), our proof gives the compatibility of homological mirror symmetry for the projective space and its Calabi-Yau hypersurface.
