For a compact almost complex 4-manifold (M,J), we study the subgroups H^{\pm}_J of H^2(M, \mathbb{R}) consisting of cohomology classes representable by J-invariant, respectively, J-anti-invariant 2-forms. If b^+ =1, we show that for generic almost complex structures on M, the subgroup H^-_J is trivial. Computations of the subgroups and their dimensions h^{\pm}_J are obtained for almost complex structures related to integrable ones. We also prove semi-continuity properties for h^{\pm}_J.
