Let G be a Lie group, and let (M,\omega) be a symplectic manifold. If G admits a Hamiltonian action on (M,\omega) with momentum map \mu, then M, the zero-level set of \mu, the orbit space, and the corresponding symplectic quotient all have induced stratifications. We push this setting into the language of differential spaces, and as a consequence we find that the stratifications are intrinsic to the ring of smooth functions on each space.
