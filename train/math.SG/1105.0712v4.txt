We use quasimap Floer cohomology for varying symplectic quotients to resolve several puzzles regarding displaceability of toric moment fibers. For example, we (i) present a compact Hamiltonian torus action containing an {\em open} subset of non-displaceable orbits and a codimension four singular set, partly answering a question of McDuff, and (ii) determine displaceability for most of the moment fibers of a symplectic ellipsoid.
