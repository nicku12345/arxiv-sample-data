In this paper we construct a family of complex structures on a complex flag manifold that converge to the real polarization coming from the Gelfand-Cetlin integrable system, in the sense that holomorphic sections of a prequantum line bundle converge to delta-function sections supported on the Bohr-Sommerfeld fibers. Our construction is based on a toric degeneration of flag varieties and a deformation of K\"ahler structure on toric varieties by symplectic potentials.
