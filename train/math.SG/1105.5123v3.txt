In this paper we first develop various enhancements of the theory of spectral invariants of Hamiltonian Floer homology and of Entovi-Polterovich theory of spectral symplectic quasi-states and quasimorphisms by incorporating \emph{bulk deformations}, i.e., deformations by ambient cycles of symplectic manifolds, of the Floer homology and quantum cohomology. Essentially the same kind of construction is independently carried out by Usher [Us4] in a slightly less general context. Then we explore various applications of these enhancements to the symplectic topology, especially new construction of symplectic quasi-states, quasimorphisms and new Lagrangian intersection results on toric manifolds. The most novel part of this paper is to use open-closed Gromov-Witten theory (operator \frak q in [FOOO1] and its variant involving closed orbits of periodic Hamiltonian system) to connect spectral invariants (with bulk deformation), symplectic quasi-states, quasimorphism to the Lagrangian Floer theory (with bulk deformation). We use this open-closed Gromov-Witten theory to produce new examples. Especially using the calculation of Lagrangian Floer homology with bulk deformation in [FOOO3,FOOO4], we produce examples of compact toric manifolds (M,\omega) which admits uncountably many independent quasimorphisms \widetilde{\operatorname{Ham}}(M,\omega) \to \mathbb R. We also obtain a new intersection result of Lagrangian submanifolds on S^2 \times S^2 discovered in [FOOO6]. Many of these applications were announced in [FOOO3,FOOO4,FOOO6].
