The moduli spaces of stable quasimaps unify various moduli appearing in the study of Gromov-Witten Theory. This note is a survey article on the moduli of stable quasimaps, based on joint papers with Ciocan-Fontanine and Maulik as well as the author's talk at Kinosaki Algebraic Geometry Symposium 2010.
