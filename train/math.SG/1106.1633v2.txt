We describe the structure of mirror formulas for genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants of projective complete intersections with any number of marked points and provide an explicit algorithm for obtaining the relevant structure coefficients. The structural description alone suffices for some qualitative applications, such as vanishing results and the bounds on the growth of these invariants predicted by R. Pandharipande.
