Consider a Hamiltonian action of a compact connected Lie group G on an aspherical symplectic manifold (M,\omega). Under suitable assumptions, counting gauge equivalence classes of (symplectic) vortices on the plane R^2 conjecturally gives rise to a quantum deformation Qk_G of the Kirwan map.   This is the second of a series of articles, whose goal is to define Qk_G rigorously. The main result is that every sequence of vortices with uniformly bounded energies has a subsequence that converges to a genus 0 stable map of vortices on R^2 and holomorphic spheres in the symplectic quotient.   Potentially, the map Qk_G can be used to compute the quantum cohomology of many symplectic quotients. Conjecturally it also gives rise to quantum generalizations of non-abelian localization and abelianization.
