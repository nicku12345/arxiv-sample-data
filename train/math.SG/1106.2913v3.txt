Let \Delta be a Delzant polytope in {\mathbb R}^n and {\mathbf b}\in{\mathbb Z}^n. Let E denote the symplectic fibration over S^2 determined by the pair (\Delta,\,{\mathbf b}). Under certain hypotheses, we prove the equivalence between the fact that (\Delta,\,{\mathbf b}) is a mass linear pair (D. McDuff, S. Tolman, {\em Polytopes with mass linear functions. I.} Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN 8 (2010) 1506-1574.) and the vanishing of a characteristic number of E. Denoting by {\rm Ham}(M_{\Delta}) the Hamiltonian group of the symplectic manifold defined by \Delta, we determine loops in {\rm Ham}(M_{\Delta}) that define infinite cyclic subgroups in \pi_1({\rm Ham}(M_{\Delta})), when \Delta satisfies any of the following conditions: (i) it is the trapezium associated with a Hirzebruch surface, (ii) it is a \Delta_p bundle over \Delta_1, (iii) \Delta is the truncated simplex associated with the one point blow up of {\mathbb C}P^n.
