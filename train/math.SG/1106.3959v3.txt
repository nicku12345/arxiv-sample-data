We compute the classical and quantum cohomology rings of the twistor spaces of 6-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds and the eigenvalues of quantum multiplication by the first Chern class. Given a half-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold we associate, after Reznikov, a monotone Lagrangian submanifold of the twistor space. In the case of a 3-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold of a hyperbolic 6-manifold we compute the obstruction term m_0 in the Fukaya-Floer A_{\infty}-algebra of a Reznikov Lagrangian and calculate the Lagrangian quantum homology. There is a well-known correspondence between the possible values of m_0 for a Lagrangian with nonvanishing Lagrangian quantum homology and eigenvalues for the action of c_1 on quantum cohomology by quantum cup product. Reznikov's Lagrangians account for most of these eigenvalues but there are four exotic eigenvalues we cannot account for.
