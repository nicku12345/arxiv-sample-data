Let M be the total space of a negative line bundle over a closed symplectic manifold. We prove that the quotient of quantum cohomology by the kernel of a power of quantum cup product by the first Chern class of the line bundle is isomorphic to symplectic cohomology. We also prove this for negative vector bundles and the top Chern class. We explicitly calculate the symplectic and quantum cohomologies of O(-n) over P^m. For n=1, M is the blow-up of C^{m+1} at the origin and symplectic cohomology has rank m. The symplectic cohomology vanishes if and only if the first Chern class of the line bundle is nilpotent in quantum cohomology. We prove a Kodaira vanishing theorem and a Serre vanishing theorem for symplectic cohomology. In general, we construct a representation of \pi_1(Ham(X,\omega)) on the symplectic cohomology of symplectic manifolds X conical at infinity.
