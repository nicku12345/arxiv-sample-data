We study the Ext-algebra of the direct sum of all parabolic Verma modules in the principal block of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category O for the hermitian symmetric pair (\mathfrak{gl}_{n+m}, \mathfrak{gl}_{n} \oplus \mathfrak{gl}_m) and present the corresponding quiver with relations for the cases n=1, 2. The Kazhdan-Lusztig combinatorics is used to deduce a general vanishing result for the higher multiplications in the A infinity-structure of a minimal model. An explicit example of the higher multiplications with non-vanishing m_3 is included.
