Consider a Stein manifold M obtained by plumbing cotangent bundles of manifolds of dimension greater than or equal to 3 at points. We prove that the Fukaya category of closed exact Lagrangians with vanishing Maslov class in M is generated by the compact cores of the plumbing. As applications, we classify exact Lagrangian spheres in A2-Milnor fibres of arbitrary dimension, derive constraints on exact Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian unknots in disk cotangent bundles, and prove that the categorical equivalence given by the spherical twist in a homology sphere is typically not realised by any compactly supported symplectomorphism.
