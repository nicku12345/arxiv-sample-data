We study smooth projective varieties with small dual variety using methods from symplectic topology. We prove the affine parts of such varieties are subcritical, and that the hyperplane class is invertible in their quantum cohomology. We derive several topological and algebraic geometric consequences from that. The main tool in our work is the Seidel representation associated to Hamiltonian fibrations.
