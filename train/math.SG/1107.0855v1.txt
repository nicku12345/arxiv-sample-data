In this article we obtain a classification of special Lagrangian submanifolds in complex space forms subject to an SO(2)\rtimes S_3-symmetry on the second fundamental form. The algebraic structure of this form has been obtained by Marianty Ionel. However, the classification of special Lagrangian submanifolds in \mathbb{C}^4 having this SO(2)\rtimes S_3 symmetry in that paper is incomplete. In the present paper we give a complete classification of such submanifolds, and extend the classification to special Lagrangian submanifolds of arbitrary complex space forms with SO(2)\rtimes S_3-symmetry.
