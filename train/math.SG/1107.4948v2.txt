We describe a necessary and sufficient condition for a principal circle bundle over an even-dimensional manifold to carry an invariant contact structure. As a corollary it is shown that all circle bundles over a given base manifold carry an invariant contact structure, only provided the trivial bundle does. In particular, all circle bundles over 4-manifolds admit invariant contact structures. We also discuss the Bourgeois construction of contact structures on odd-dimensional tori in this context, and we relate our results to recent work of Massot, Niederkrueger and Wendl on weak symplectic fillings in higher dimensions.
