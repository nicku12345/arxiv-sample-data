We use monopole Floer homology for sutured manifolds to construct invariants of Legendrian knots in a contact 3-manifold. These invariants assign to a knot K in Y elements of the monopole knot homology KHM(-Y,K), and they strongly resemble the knot Floer homology invariants of Lisca, Ozsv\'ath, Stipsicz, and Szab\'o. We prove several vanishing results, investigate their behavior under contact surgeries, and use this to construct many examples of non-loose knots in overtwisted 3-manifolds. We also show that these invariants are functorial with respect to Lagrangian concordance.
