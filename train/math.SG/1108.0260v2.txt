In this paper we calculate the Lagrangian Floer homology HF(L_0, L_1 : {\mathbb Z}_2) of a pair of real forms (L_0,L_1) in a monotone Hermitian symmetric space M of compact type in the case where L_0 is not necessarily congruent to L_1. In particular, we have a generalization of the Arnold-Givental inequality in the case where M is irreducible. As its application, we prove that the totally geodesic Lagrangian sphere in the complex hyperquadric is globally volume minimizing under Hamiltonian deformations.
