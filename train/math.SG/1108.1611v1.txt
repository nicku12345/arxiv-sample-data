Let G be a complex semisimple Lie group and {G}_{\mathbb R} a real form that contains a compact Cartan subgroup T_{\mathbb R}. Let \pi be a discrete series representation of G_{\mathbb R}. We present geometric interpretations in terms of concepts associated with the manifold M:=G_{\mathbb R}/T_{\mathbb R} of the constant \pi(g), for g\in Z(G_{\mathbb R}). For some relevant particular cases, we prove that this constant is the action integral around a loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphims of M. As a consequence of these interpretations, we deduce lower bounds for the cardinal of the fundamental group of some subgroups of {\rm Diff}(M). We also geometrically interpret the values of the infinitesimal character of the differential representation of \pi.
