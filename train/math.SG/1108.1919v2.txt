Kotschick and Morita recently discovered factorisations of characteristic classes of transversally symplectic foliations that yield new characteristic classes in foliated cohomology. We describe an alternative construction of such factorisations and construct examples of topologically trivial foliated vector bundles for which these characteristic classes are non-trivial. This shows that the foliated cohomology classes of Kotschick and Morita carry information that is not merely topological.
