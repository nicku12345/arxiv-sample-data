In this note we define the notion of collarable slices of Lagrangian submanifolds. Those are slices of Lagrangian submanifolds which can be isotoped through Lagrangian submanifolds to a cylinder over a Legendrian embedding near a contact hypersurface. Such a notion arises naturally when studying intersections of Lagrangian submanifolds with contact hypersurfaces. We then give two explicit examples of Lagrangian disks in \mathbb{C}^2 transverse to S^3 whose slices are non-collarable.
