The Floer homology of a cotangent bundle is isomorphic to loop space homology of the underlying manifold, as proved by Abbondandolo-Schwarz, Salamon-Weber, and Viterbo. In this paper we show that in the presence of a Dirac magnetic monopole which admits a primitive with sublinear growth on the universal cover, the Floer homology in atoroidal free homotopy classes is again isomorphic to loop space homology. As a consequence we prove that for any atoroidal free homotopy class and any sufficiently small T>0, any magnetic flow associated to the Dirac magnetic monopole has a closed orbit of period T belonging to the given free homotopy class. In the case where the Dirac magnetic monopole admits a bounded primitive on the universal cover we also prove the Conley conjecture for Hamiltonians that are quadratic at infinity, i.e., we show that such Hamiltonians have infinitely many periodic orbits.
