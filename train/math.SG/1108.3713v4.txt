Log Gromov-Witten invariants have recently been defined separately by Gross and Siebert and Abramovich and Chen. This paper provides a dictionary between log geometry and holomorphic exploded manifolds in order to compare Gromov-Witten invariants defined using exploded manifolds or log schemes. The gluing formula for Gromov-Witten invariants of exploded manifolds suggests an approach to proving analogous gluing formulas for log Gromov-Witten invariants.
