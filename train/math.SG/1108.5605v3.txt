We study the Lagrangian quantum homology of real parts of Fano toric manifolds of minimal Chern number at least 2, using coefficients in a ring of Laurent polynomials over Z/2Z. We show that these Lagrangians are wide, in the sense that their quantum homology is isomorphic as a module to their classical homology tensored with this ring. Moreover, we show that the quantum homology is isomorphic as a ring to the quantum homology of the ambient symplectic manifold.
