Given an integer b and a finitely presented group G we produce a compact symplectic six-manifold with c_1 = 0, b_2 > b, b_3 > b and fundamental group G. In the simply-connected case we can also arrange for b_3 = 0; in particular these examples are not diffeomorphic to K\"ahler manifolds with c_1 = 0. The construction begins with a certain orientable four-dimensional hyperbolic orbifold assembled from right-angled 120-cells. The twistor space of the hyperbolic orbifold is a symplectic Calabi-Yau orbifold; a crepant resolution of this last orbifold produces a smooth symplectic manifold with the required properties.
