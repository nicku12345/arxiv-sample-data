To each simplicial reflexive polytope in Z^(n+1), we attach an n-dimensional space, Lambda^\infty. It is the Legendrian boundary of a conic Lagrangian considered in work of the authors, Fang and Liu, and because of this it carries a sheaf of dg categories called the "Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf." We discuss some conjectures and results about the role that Lambda^\infty and the Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf should play in homological mirror symmetry.
