This paper discusses the cobordism of Lagrangian submanifolds (in the monotone setting) and structures it as a category that is related in a functorial way to an appropriate (derived) Fukaya category. Are also discussed obstructions to cobordism based on properties of Lagrangian quantum homology, relations to Lagrangian surgery, as well as examples of non-isotopic but cobordant Lagrangians. This is a revision of our earlier preprint from September 2011.
