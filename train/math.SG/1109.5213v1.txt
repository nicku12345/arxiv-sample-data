We will quickly explore the derived geometry of zero loci of sections of vector bundles, with particular emphasis on derived critical loci. In particular we will single out many of the derived geometric structures carried by derived critical loci: the homotopy Batalin-Vilkovisky structure, the action of the 2-monoid of the self-intersection of the zero section, and the derived symplectic structure of degree -1, and show how this structure exists, more generally, on derived lagrangian intersections inside a symplectic manifold. These are just applications of a small part of a much larger project - joint with Pantev, To\"en and Vaqui\'e - investigating quantization of derived moduli spaces.
