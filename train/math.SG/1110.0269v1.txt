For the sake of hyperk{\"a}hler SYZ conjecture, finding holomorphic Lagrangian fibrations becomes an important issue. Toric hyperk{\"a}hler manifolds are real dimension 4n non-compact hyperk{\"a}hler manifolds which are quaternion analog of toric varieties. The n dimensional residue circle action on it admitting a hyperk{\"a}hler moment map. We use the complex part of this moment map to construct a holomorphic Lagrangian fibration with generic fiber diffeomorphic to (\mathbb{C}^*)^n, and study the singular fibers.
