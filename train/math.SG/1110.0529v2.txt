We establish a version of the Arnold conjecture, both the degenerate and non-degenerate case, for target manifolds equipped with Clifford pencils of symplectic structures and the domains (time-manifolds) equipped with frames of divergence-free vector fields. This result generalizes the original work on the hyperkahler Arnold conjecture by Hohloch, Noetzel and Salamon for three-dimensional time and also the previous work by the authors.
