A point q in a contact manifold is called a translated point for a contactomorphism \phi, with respect to some fixed contact form, if \phi(q) and q belong to the same Reeb orbit and the contact form is preserved at q. In this article we discuss a version of the Arnold conjecture for translated points of contactomorphisms and, using generating functions techniques, we prove it in the case of spheres (under a genericity assumption) and projective spaces.
