A classical theorem of Drinfel'd states that the category of simply connected Poisson Lie groups H is isomorphic to the category of Manin triples (d, g, h), where h is the Lie algebra of H. In this paper, we consider Dirac Lie groups, that is, Lie groups H endowed with a multiplicative Courant algebroid A and a Dirac structure E /subset A for which the multiplication is a Dirac morphism. It turns out that the simply connected Dirac Lie groups are classified by so-called Dirac Manin triples. We give an explicit construction of the Dirac Lie group structure defined by a Dirac Manin triple, and develop its basic properties.
