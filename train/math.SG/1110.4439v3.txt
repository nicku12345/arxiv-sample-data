We prove that the inverse of a mirror map for a toric Calabi-Yau manifold of the form K_Y, where Y is a compact toric Fano manifold, can be expressed in terms of generating functions of genus 0 open Gromov-Witten invariants defined by Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono \cite{FOOO10}. Such a relation between mirror maps and disk counting invariants was first conjectured by Gross and Siebert \cite[Conjecture 0.2 and Remark 5.1]{GS11} as part of their program, and was later formulated in terms of Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono's invariants in the toric Calabi-Yau case in \cite[Conjecture 1.1]{CLL12}.
