Let (N,c_N) be a complex vector bundle equipped with a real structure over a real curve (\Sigma,c_\Sigma) of genus g \geq 0. We compute the sign of the action of the automorphisms of (N,c_N) lifting the identity of \Sigma on the orientations of the determinant line bundle over the space of real Cauchy-Riemann operators on (N,c_N). This sign can be obtained as the product of two terms. The first one computes the signature of the permutations induced by the automorphisms acting on the Pin^\pm structures of the real part of (N,c_N). The second one comes from the action of the automorphisms of (N,c_N) on the bordism classes of real Spin structures on (\Sigma,c_\Sigma).
