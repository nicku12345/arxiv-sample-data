We classify positive tight contact structures, up to isotopy fixing the boundary, on the manifolds N=M(D^{2}; r_1, r_2) with minimal convex boundary of slope s and Giroux torsion 0 along \partial N, where r_1,r_2\in (0,1)\cap\mathbb{Q}, in the following cases:   (1) s\in(-\infty, 0)\cup[2, +\infty);   (2) s\in[0, 1) and r_1,r_2\in [1/2,1);   (3) s\in[1, 2) and r_1,r_2\in(0,1/2);   (4) s=\infty and r_1=r_2=1/2.   We also classify positive tight contact structures, up to isotopy fixing the boundary, on M(D^2;1/2,1/2) with minimal convex boundary of arbitrary slope and Giroux torsion greater than 0 along the boundary.
