In "Proof of the Arnold chord conjecture in three dimensions I", we deduced the Arnold chord conjecture in three dimensions from another result, which asserts that an exact symplectic cobordism between contact three-manifolds induces a map on (filtered) embedded contact homology satisfying certain axioms. The present paper proves the latter result, thus completing the proof of the three-dimensional chord conjecture. We also prove that filtered embedded contact homology does not depend on the choice of almost complex structure used to define it.
