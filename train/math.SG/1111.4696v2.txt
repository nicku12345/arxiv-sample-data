This article addresses the problem of developing an extension of the Marsden- Weinstein reduction process to symplectic Lie algebroids, and in particular to the case of the symplectic cover of a fiberwise linear Poisson structure, whose reduction process is the analogue to cotangent bundle reduction in the context of Lie algebroids.
