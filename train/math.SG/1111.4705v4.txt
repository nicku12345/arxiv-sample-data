We study contact structures on nonnegatively-graded manifolds equipped with homological contact vector fields. In the degree 1 case, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between such structures (with fixed contact form) and Jacobi manifolds. This correspondence allows us to reinterpret the Poissonization procedure, taking Jacobi manifolds to Poisson manifolds, as a supergeometric version of symplectization.
