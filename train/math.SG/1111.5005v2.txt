In [29], Plebanski reformulated the anti-self-dual Einstein equations with non-zero scalar curvature as a first order PDE for a connection in an SO(3)-bundle over the four-manifold. The aim of this article is to place this differential equation in a new framework, in which it is both elliptic and a stationary point of a parabolic flow. To do this, we exploit a link with definite connections (introduced in [12]) to draw an analogy with instantons and the Yang-Mills flow. This picture leads to a natural conjecture, analogous to one made by Donaldson concerning hyperk\"ahler 4-manifolds [9]. It also provides a moment-map description of the anti-self-dual Einstein equations with non-zero scalar curvature.
