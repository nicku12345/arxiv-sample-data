Let k > 2. We show that if a closed orientable 2k-manifold K, with Euler characteristic not equal to -2, admits an exact Lagrangian immersion into complex Euclidean 2k-space with one transverse double point and no other self-intersections, then K is diffeomorphic to the standard sphere. The proof combines Floer homological arguments with a detailed study of moduli spaces of holomorphic disks with boundary in a monotone Lagrangian submanifold obtained by Lagrange surgery on K.
