We show that every 4-dimensional torus with a linear symplectic form can be fully filled by one symplectic ball. If such a torus is not symplectomorphic to a product of 2-dimensional tori with equal sized factors, then it can also be fully filled by any finite collection of balls provided only that their total volume is less than that of the 4-torus with its given linear symplectic form.
