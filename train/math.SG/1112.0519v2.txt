We show that if a contact open book (\Sigma,h) on a (2n+1)-manifold M (n\geq1) is induced by a Lefschetz fibration \pi:W \to D^2, then there is a one-to-one correspondence between positive stabilizations of (\Sigma,h) and \emph{positive stabilizations} of \pi. More precisely, any positive stabilization of (\Sigma,h) is induced by the corresponding positive stabilization of \pi, and conversely any positive stabilization of \pi induces the corresponding positive stabilization of (\Sigma,h). We define \emph{exact open books} as boundary open books of compatible exact Lefschetz fibrations, and show that any exact open book carries a contact structure. Moreover, we prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence (similar to the one above) between \emph{convex stabilizations} of an exact open book and \emph{convex stabilizations} of the corresponding compatible exact Lefschetz fibration. We also show that convex stabilization of compatible exact Lefschetz fibrations produces symplectomorphic completions.
