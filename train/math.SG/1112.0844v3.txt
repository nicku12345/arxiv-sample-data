We study Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) for A_n-resolutions from the SYZ viewpoint. Let X\to\bC^2/\bZ_{n+1} be the crepant resolution of the A_n-singularity. The mirror of X is given by a smoothing \check{X} of \bC^2/\bZ_{n+1}. Using SYZ transformations, we construct a geometric functor from a derived Fukaya category of \check{X} to the derived category of coherent sheaves on X. We show that this is an equivalence of triangulated categories onto a full triangulated subcategory of D^b(X), thus realizing Kontsevich's HMS conjecture by SYZ.
