In this article, we initiate a geometric measure theoretic approach to symplectic Hodge theory. In particular, we apply one of the central results in geometric measure theory, the Federer-Fleming deformation theorem, together with the cohomology theory of normal cur- rents on a differential manifold, to establish a fundamental property on symplectic Harmonic forms. We show that on a closed symplectic manifold, every real primitive cohomology class of positive degrees admits a symplectic Harmonic representative not supported on the entire mani- fold. As an application, we use it to investigate the support of symplectic Harmonic representatives of Thom classes, and give a complete solution to an open question asked by Guillemin.
