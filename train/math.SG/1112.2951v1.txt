In this paper, we show the existence of (co-oriented) contact structures on certain classes of G_2-manifolds, and that these two structures are compatible in certain ways. Moreover, we prove that any seven-manifold with a spin structure (and so any manifold with G_2-structure) admits an almost contact structure. We also construct explicit almost contact metric structures on manifolds with G_2-structures.
