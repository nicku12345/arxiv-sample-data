Let (M,\omega) be an aspherical symplectic manifold, which is closed or convex. Let U be an open set in M, which admits a circle action generated by an autonomous Hamiltonian H \in C^\infty(U), such that each orbit of the circle action is not contractible in M. Under these assumptions, we prove that the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of U is bounded by the Hofer norm of H. The proof uses a variant of the energy-capacity inequality, which is proved by the theory of action selectors.
