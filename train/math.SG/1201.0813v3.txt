We show that the Gromov-Witten theory of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces matches, in genus zero and after an analytic continuation, the quantum singularity theory (FJRW theory) recently introduced by Fan, Jarvis and Ruan following ideas of Witten. Moreover, on both sides, we highlight two remarkable integral local systems arising from the common formalism of Gamma-integral structures applied to the derived category of the hypersurface {W=0} and to the category of graded matrix factorizations of W. In this setup, we prove that the analytic continuation matches Orlov equivalence between the two above categories.
