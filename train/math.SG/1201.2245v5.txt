We give an h--principle type result for a class of Legendrian embeddings in contact manifolds of dimension at least 5. These Legendrians, referred to as loose, have trivial pseudo-holomorphic invariants. We demonstrate they are classified up to Legendrian isotopy by their smooth isotopy class equipped with an almost complex framing. This result is inherently high dimensional: analogous results in dimension 3 are false.
