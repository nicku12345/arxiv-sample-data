Let L be a closed orientable Lagrangian submanifold of a closed symplectic six-manifold (X, \omega). We assume that the first homology group H_1 (L ; A) with coefficients in a commutative ring A injects into the group H_1 (X ; A) and that X contains no Maslov zero pseudo-holomorphic disc with boundary on L. Then, we prove that for every generic choice of a tame almost-complex structure J on X, every relative homology class d \in H_2 (X, L ; \Z) and adequate number of incidence conditions in L or X, the weighted number of J-holomorphic discs with boundary on L, homologous to d, and either irreducible or reducible disconnected, which satisfy the conditions, does not depend on the generic choice of J, provided that at least one incidence condition lies in L. These numbers thus define open Gromov-Witten invariants in dimension six, taking values in the ring A.
