We build the wrapped Fukaya category W(E) for any monotone symplectic manifold, convex at infinity. We define the open-closed and closed open-string maps. We study their algebraic properties and prove that the string maps are compatible with the eigenvalue splitting of W(E). We extend Abouzaid's generation criterion from the exact to the monotone setting. We construct an acceleration functor from the compact Fukaya category which on Hochschild (co)homology commutes with the string maps and the canonical map from quantum cohomology QH(E) to symplectic cohomology SH(E). We define the QH(E)- and SH(E)-module structure on the Hochschild (co)homology of W(E) which is compatible with the string maps. The module and unital algebra structures, and the generation criterion, also hold for the compact Fukaya category F(E), and also hold for closed monotone symplectic manifolds. As an application, we show that the wrapped category of any monotone negative line bundle over any projective space is proper (cohomologically finite). For any monotone negative line bundle E over a toric Fano variety, we show that SH(E) is non-trivial and that W(E) contains an essential non-displaceable monotone Lagrangian torus.
