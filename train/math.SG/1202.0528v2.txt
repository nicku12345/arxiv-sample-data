Let Q be a Riemannian manifold such that the Betti numbers of its free loop space with respect to some coefficient field are unbounded. We show that every contact form on its unit contangent bundle supporting the natural contact structure has infinitely many simple Reeb orbits. This is an extension of a theorem by Gromoll and Meyer. We also show that if a compact manifold admits a Stein fillable contact structure then there is a possibly different such structure which also has infinitely many simple Reeb orbits for every supporting contact form. We use local Floer homology along with symplectic homology to prove these facts.
