We consider classes of algebraic manifolds \mathcal{A}, of symplectic manifolds \mathcal{S}, of symplectic manifolds with the hard Lefschetz property \mathcal{HS} and the class of cohomologically symplectic manifolds \mathcal{CS}. For every class of manifolds \mathcal{C} we denote by \mathcal{EC}(\pi,n) a subclass of n-dimensional essential manifolds with fundamental group \pi. In this paper we prove that for all the above classes with symplectically aspherical form the condition \mathcal{EC}(\pi,2n)\ne \emptyset implies that \mathcal{EC}(\pi,2n-2)\ne\emptyset  for every n>2. Also we prove that all the inclusions \mathcal{EA}\subset\mathcal{EHS}\subset\mathcal{ES}\subset\mathcal{ECS} are proper.
