We introduce a local version of contact homology for an isolated periodic orbit of the Reeb flow and prove that its rank is uniformly bounded for isolated iterations. Several applications are obtained, including a generalization of Gromoll-Meyer's theorem on the existence of infinitely many simple periodic orbits, resonance relations and conditions for the existence of non-hyperbolic periodic orbits.
