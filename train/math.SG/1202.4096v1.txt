Let (X, \omega) be a compact symplectic manifold and L be a Lagrangian submanifold. Suppose (X, L) has a Hamiltonian S^1 action with moment map \mu. Take an invariant \omega-compatible almost complex structure, we consider tuples (C, P, A, \varphi) where C is a smooth bordered Riemann surface of fixed topological type, P\to C is an S^1-principal bundle, A is a connection on P and \varphi is a section of P\times_{S^1} X satisfying \ov\partial_A \varphi=0,\ \iota_\nu F_A+ \mu(\varphi)=c with boundary condition \varphi(\partial C) \subset P \times_{S^1} L. Here F_A is the curvature of A and \nu is a volume form on C and c\in i{\mb R} is a constant.   We compactify the moduli space of isomorphism classes of such objects with energy \leq K, where the energy is defined to be the Yang-Mills-Higgs functional \| F_A\|_{L^2}^2+ \| d_A\varphi \|_{L^2}^2+ \| \mu(\varphi)-c \|_{L^2}^2. This generalizes the compactness theorem of Mundet-Tian \cite{Mundet_Tian_2009} in the case of closed Riemann surfaces.
