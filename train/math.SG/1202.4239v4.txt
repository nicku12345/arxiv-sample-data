We build compact moduli spaces of Grassmannian framed bundles over a Riemann surface, essentially replacing a group by its bi-invariant compactification. We do this both in the algebraic and symplectic settings, and prove a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence between the two. The spaces are universal spaces for parabolic bundles, and the reduction to parabolic bundles commutes with the correspondence. An analogous correspondence is outlined for the generalized parabolic bundles of Bhosle.
