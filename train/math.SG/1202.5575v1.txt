We propose to study deformation quantizations of Whitney functions. To this end, we extend the notion of a deformation quantization to algebras of Whitney functions over a singular set, and show the existence of a deformation quantization of Whitney functions over a closed subset of a symplectic manifold. Under the assumption that the underlying symplectic manifold is analytic and the singular subset subanalytic, we determine that the Hochschild and cyclic homology of the deformed algebra of Whitney functions over the subanalytic subset coincide with the Whitney--de Rham cohomology. Finally, we note how an algebraic index theorem for Whitney functions can be derived.
