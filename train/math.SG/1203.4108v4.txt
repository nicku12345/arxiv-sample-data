We determine the one point genus zero correlators of compactly supported forms of a subcritical Stein filling whose first Chern class vanishes. This is a step towards determining the full potential function of the filling. As an application, we proved that if a K\"{a}hler manifold M^{2n} admits a subcritical polarization and c_1 vanishes in the subcritical complement, then M is uniruled.
