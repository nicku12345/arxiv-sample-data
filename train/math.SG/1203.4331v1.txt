Let J be an almost complex structure on a 4-dimensional and unimodular Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. We show that there exists a symplectic form taming J if and only if there is a symplectic form compatible with J. We also introduce groups H^+_J(\mathfrak{g}) and H^-_J(\mathfrak{g}) as the subgroups of the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology classes which can be represented by J-invariant, respectively J-anti-invariant, 2-forms on \mathfrak{g}. and we prove a cohomological J-decomposition theorem following \cite{DLZ}: H^2(\mathfrak{g})=H^+_J(\mathfrak{g})\oplus H^-_J(\mathfrak{g}). We discover that tameness of J can be characterized in terms of the dimension of H^{\pm}_J(\mathfrak{g}), just as in the complex surface case. We also describe the tamed and compatible symplectic cones respectively. Finally, two applications to homogeneous J on 4-manifolds are obtained.
