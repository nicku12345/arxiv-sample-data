This sequel to our previous paper [MS11b] continues the study of topological contact dynamics and applications to contact dynamics and topological dynamics. We provide further evidence that the topological automorphism groups of a contact structure and a contact form are the appropriate transformation groups of contact dynamical systems. The article includes an examination of the groups of time-one maps of topological contact and strictly contact isotopies, and the construction of a bi-invariant metric on the latter. Moreover, every topological contact or strictly contact dynamical system is arbitrarily close to a continuous contact or strictly contact dynamical system with the same end point. In particular, the above groups of time-one maps are independent of the choice of norm in the definition of the contact distance. On every contact manifold we construct topological contact dynamical systems with time-one maps that fail to be Lipschitz continuous, and smooth contact vector fields whose flows are topologically conjugate but not conjugate by a contact C^1-diffeomorphism.
