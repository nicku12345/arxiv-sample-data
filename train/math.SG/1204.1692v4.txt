We study constructions of contact forms on closed manifolds. A notion of strong symplectic fold structure is defined and we prove that there is a contact form on M \x X provided that M admits such a structure and X is contact. This result is extended to fibrations satisfying certain natural conditions. Some examples and applications are given.
