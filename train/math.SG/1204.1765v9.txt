This is the first in a sequence of papers in which we construct a quantum version of the Kirwan map from the equivariant quantum cohomology QH_G(X) of a smooth complex projective variety X with the action of a connected complex reductive group G to the orbifold quantum cohomology QH(X//G) of its geometric invariant theory quotient X//G, and prove that it intertwines the genus zero gauged Gromov-Witten potential of X with the genus zero Gromov-Witten graph potential of X//G.
