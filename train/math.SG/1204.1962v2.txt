Sivek proves a "van Kampen" decomposition theorem for the combinatorial Legendrian contact algebra (also known as the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra) of knots in standard contact \R^3 . We prove an analogous result for the holomorphic curve version of the Legendrian contact algebra of certain Legendrians submanifolds in standard contact J^1(M). This includes all 1- and 2-dimensional Legendrians, and some higher dimensional ones. We present various applications including a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for linearized contact homology similar to Sivek's and a connect sum formula for the augmentation variety introduced by Ng. The main tool is the theory of gradient flow trees developed by Ekholm.
