In this paper, we describe explicit relations in the symplectomorphism groups of toric hypersurfaces. To define the elements involved, we construct a proper stack of toric hypersurfaces with compactifying boundary representing toric hypersurface degenerations. Our relations arise through the study of the one dimensional strata of this stack. The results are then examined from the perspective of homological mirror symmetry where we view sequences of relations as maximal degenerations of Landau-Ginzburg models. We then study the B-model mirror to these degenerations, which gives a new mirror symmetry approach to the minimal model program.
