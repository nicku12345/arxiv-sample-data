Let \gamma be a non-degenerate Ustilovsky geodesic in Ham (M, \omega) generated by H. We give a simple proof of a generalization of the conjecture stated in \cite{virtmorse}, relating the Morse index of  \gamma, as a critical point of the Hofer length functional, with the Conley Zehnder index of the extremizers of H, considered as periodic orbits.
