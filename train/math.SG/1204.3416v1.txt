A classical result of D. McDuff asserts that a simply-connected complete Kaehler manifold (M,g,\omega) with non positive sectional curvature admits global symplectic coordinates through a symplectomorphism \Psi: M\rightarrow R^{2n} (where n is the complex dimension of M), satisfying the following property (proved by E. Ciriza): the image \Psi (T) of any complex totally geodesic submanifold T\subset M through the point p such that \Psi(p)=0, is a complex linear subspace of C^n \simeq R^{2n}. The aim of this paper is to exhibit, for all positive integers n, examples of n-dimensional complete Kaehler manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature globally symplectomorphic to R^{2n} through a symplectomorphism satisfying Ciriza's property.
