We show that an infinite family of contractible 4-manifolds have the same boundary as a special type of plumbing. Consequently their Ozsvath--Szabo invariants can be calculated algorithmically. We run this algorithm for the first few members of the family and list the resulting Heegaard--Floer homologies. We also show that the rank of the Heegaard--Floer homology can get arbitrary large values in this family by using its relation with the Casson invariant. For comparison, we list the ranks of Floer homologies of all the examples of Briekorn spheres that are known to bound contractible manifolds.
