A generalized complex manifold which satisfies the \partial \overline{\partial}-lemma admits a Hodge decomposition in twisted cohomology. Using a Courant algebroid theoretic approach we study the behavior of the Hodge decomposition in smooth and holomorphic families of generalized complex manifolds. In particular we define period maps, prove a Griffiths transversality theorem and show that for holomorphic families the period maps are holomorphic. Further results on the Hodge decomposition for various special cases including the generalized K\"ahler case are obtained.
