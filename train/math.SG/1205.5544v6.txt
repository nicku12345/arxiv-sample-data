Let L \subset Y be a Legendrian submanifold of a contact manifold, S\subset L a framed embedded sphere bounding an isotropic disc D_S \subset Y \setminus L, and use L_S to denote the manifold obtained from L by a surgery on S. Given some additional conditions on D_S we describe how to obtain a Legendrian embedding of L_S into an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of L \cup D_S \subset Y by a construction that we call Legendrian ambient surgery. In the case when the disc is subcritical, we produce an isomorphism of the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra of L_S with a version of the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra of L whose differential is twisted by a count of pseudo-holomorphic discs with boundary-point constraints on S. This isomorphism induces a one-to-one correspondence between the augmentations of the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebras of L and L_S.
