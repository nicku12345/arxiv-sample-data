Let M^{2n} be a Poisson manifold with Poisson bivector field \Pi. We say that M is b-Poisson if the map \Pi^n:M\to\Lambda^{2n}(TM) intersects the zero section transversally on a codimension one submanifold Z\subset M. This paper will be a systematic investigation of such Poisson manifolds. In particular, we will study in detail the structure of (M,\Pi) in the neighbourhood of Z and using symplectic techniques define topological invariants which determine the structure up to isomorphism. We also investigate a variant of de Rham theory for these manifolds and its connection with Poisson cohomology.
