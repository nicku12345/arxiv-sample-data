Early in 2011 Sam Evens acting on behalf of the organizers of the summer school on quantization at Notre Dame asked me to give a short series of lectures on geometric quantization. These lectures were meant to prepare a group of graduate mathematics students for talks at the conference on quantization which were to follow the summer school. The notes that follow resulted from this request. They are a mostly faithful record of four one-hour lectures (except lecture 4) plus two appendices: the first one recalls bits and pieces of category theory; the second discusses densities.
