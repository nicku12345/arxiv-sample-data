We find new obstructions on the topology of monotone Lagrangian submanifolds of C^{n} under some hypothesis on the homology of their universal cover. In particular we show that nontrivial connected sums of manifolds of odd dimensions do not admit monotone Lagrangian embeddings into \C^{n} whereas some of these examples are known to admit usual Lagrangian embeddings. In dimension three we get as a corollary that the only orientable Lagrangians in {\bf C}^{3} are products S^{1}\times \Sigma.
