We identify the canonical contact structure on the link of a simple elliptic or cusp singularity by drawing a Legendrian handlebody diagram of one of its Stein fillings. We also show that the canonical contact structure on the link of a numerically Gorenstein surface singularity is trivial considered as a real plane bundle.
