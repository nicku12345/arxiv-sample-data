Partially motivated by the study of topological Hamiltonian dynamics, we prove various C^0-aspects of the Lagrangian spectral invariants and the basic phase functions f_H, that is, a natural graph selector constructed by Lagrangian Floer homology of H (relative to the zero section o_N). In particular, we prove that  \gamma^{lag}(\phi_H^1(o_N)): = \rho^{lag}(H;1) - \rho^{lag}(H;[pt]^\#) \to 0  as \phi_H^1 \to id, \emph{provided} H's satisfy \supp X_H \subset D^R(T^*N) \setminus o_B for some R > 0 and a closed subset B \subset N with nonempty interior. We also study the relationship between f_H and \rho^{lag}(H;1) and prove a structure theorem of the micro-support of the singular locus \Sing(\sigma_H) of the function f_H. Based on this structure theorem and a classification theorem of generic Lagrangian singularity in \dim N = 2 obtained by Arnold's school, we define the notion of cliff-wall surgery when \dim N = 2: the surgery replaces a multi-valued Lagrangian graph \phi_H^1(o_N) by a piecewise-smooth Lagrangian cycle that is canonically constructed out of the single valued branch \Sigma_H: = \Graph df_H \subset \phi_H^1(o_N) defined on an open dense subset of N \setminus \Sing(\sigma_H) of codimension 1.
