Making use of theory of differentiable stacks, we study symplectic vortex equations over a compact orbifold Riemann surface. We discuss the category of representable morphisms from a compact orbifold Riemann surface to a quotient stack. After that we define symplectic vortex equations over a compact orbifold Riemann surface. We also discuss the moduli space of solutions to the equations for linear actions of the circle group on the complex plane.
