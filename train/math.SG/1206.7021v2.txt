The projective Finsler metrizability problem deals with the question whether a projective-equivalence class of sprays is the geodesic class of a (locally or globally defined) Finsler function. In this paper we use Hilbert-type forms to state a number of different ways of specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for this to be the case, and we show that they are equivalent. We also address several related issues of interest including path spaces, Jacobi fields, totally-geodesic submanifolds of a spray space, and the equivalence of path geometries and projective-equivalence classes of sprays.
