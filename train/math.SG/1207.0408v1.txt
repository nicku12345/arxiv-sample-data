A Maslov cycle is a singular variety in the lagrangian grassmannian L(V) of a symplectic vector space V consisting of all lagrangian subspaces having nonzero intersection with a fixed one. Givental has shown that a Maslov cycle is a Legendre singularity, i.e. the projection of a smooth conic lagrangian submanifold S in the cotangent bundle of L(V). We show here that S is the wavefront set of a Fourier integral distribution which is "evaluation at 0 of the quantizations".
