In the framework of geometric quantization we extend the Bohr-Sommerfeld rules to a full quantization theory which resembles Heisenberg's matrix theory. This extension is possible because Bohr-Sommerfeld rules not only provide an orthogonal basis in the space of quantum states, but also give a lattice structure to this basis. This permits the definition of appropriate shifting operators. As examples, we discuss the 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the coadjoint orbits of the rotation group.
