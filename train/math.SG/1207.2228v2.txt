We obtain estimates showing that on monotone symplectic manifolds (asymptotic) spectral invariants of Hamiltonians which vanish on a non-empty open set, U, descend to Ham_c(M\setminus U) from its universal cover. Furthermore, we show these invariants and are continuous with respect to the C^0-topology on Ham_c(M\setminus U). We apply these results to Hofer geometry and establish unboundedness of the Hofer diameter of Ham_c(M\setminus U) for stably displaceable U. We also answer a question of F. Le Roux about C^0-continuity properties of the Hofer metric.
