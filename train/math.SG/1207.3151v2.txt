For certain contact manifolds admitting a 1-periodic Reeb flow we construct a conjugation-invariant norm on the universal cover of the contactomorphism group. With respect to this norm the group admits a quasi-isometric monomorphism of the real line. The construction involves the partial order on contactomorphisms and symplectic intersections. This norm descends to a conjugation-invariant norm on the contactomorphism group. As a counterpoint, we discuss conditions under which conjugation-invariant norms for contactomorphisms are necessarily bounded.
