In the present paper we describe compatible open books for the fibre connected sum along binding components of open books, as well as for the fibre connected sum along multi-sections of open books. As an application the first description provides simple ways of constructing open books supporting all tight contact structures on T^3, recovering a result by van Horn-Morris, as well as an open book supporting the result of a Lutz twist along a binding component of an open book, recovering a result by Ozbagci--Pamuk.
