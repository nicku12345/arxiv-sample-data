Let (\X,\omega) be a compact symplectic orbifold. We define \pi_1(Ham(\X, \omega)), the fundamental group of the 2-group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of (\X, \omega), and construct a group homomorphism from \pi_1(Ham(\X, \omega)) to the group QH_{orb}^*(\X,\Lambda)^{\times} of multiplicatively invertible elements in the orbifold quantum cohomology ring of (\X, \omega). This extends the Seidel representation ([Se], [M]) to symplectic orbifolds.
