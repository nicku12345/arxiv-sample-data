Symplectic Field Theory studies J-holomorphic curves in almost complex manifolds with cylindrical ends. One natural generalization is to replace 'cylindrical' by 'asymptotically cylindrical'. In this article, we generalize the asymptotic results about the behavior of J-holomorphic curves near infinity to the asymptotically cylindrical setting. We also sketch how these asymptotic results allow the main compactness theorems in Symplectic Field Theory proved by Bourgeois, Eliashberg, Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder to be extended to the asymptotically cylindrical case.
