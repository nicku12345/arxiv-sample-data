This article studies the abelian analytic torsion on a closed, oriented, Sasakian three-manifold and identifies this quantity as a specific multiple of the natural unit symplectic volume form on the moduli space of flat abelian connections. This identification computes the analytic torsion explicitly in terms of Seifert data.
