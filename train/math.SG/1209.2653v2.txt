Let M denote the total space of a Lefschetz fibration, obtained by blowing up a Lefschetz pencil on an algebraic surface. We consider the n-fold fibre sum M(n), generalizing the construction of the elliptic surfaces E(n). For a Lefschetz pencil on a simply-connected minimal surface of general type we partially calculate the Seiberg-Witten invariants of the fibre sum M(n) using a formula of Morgan-Szabo-Taubes. As an application we derive an obstruction for self-diffeomorphisms of the boundary of the tubular neighbourhood of a general fibre in M(n) to extend over the complement of the neighbourhood. Similar obstructions are known in the case of elliptic surfaces.
