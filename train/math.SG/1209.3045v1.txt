We show that, for any two orientable smooth open 4-manifolds X_0,X_1 which are homeomorphic, their cotangent bundles T^*X_0,T^*X_1 are symplectomorphic with their canonical symplectic structure. In particular, for any smooth manifold R homeomorphic to \mathbb{R}^4, the standard Stein structure on T^*R is Stein homotopic to the standard Stein structure on T^*\mathbb{R}^4 = \mathbb{R}^8. We use this to show that any exotic \mathbb{R}^4 embeds in the standard symplectic \mathbb{R}^8 as a Lagrangian submanifold. As a corollary, we show that \mathbb{R}^8 has uncountably many smoothly distinct foliations by Lagrangian \mathbb{R}^4s with their standard smooth structure.
