We give an equivalent definition of the Fredholm property for linear operators on scale Banach spaces and introduce a (nonlinear) scale Fredholm property with respect to a splitting of the domain. The latter implies the Fredholm property introduced by Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder in terms of contraction germs, but is easier to check in practice and holds in applications to holomorphic curve moduli spaces. We demonstrate this at the example of trajectory breaking in Hamiltonian Floer theory.
