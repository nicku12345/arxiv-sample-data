We prove that any Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a closed symplectic manifold equipped with an atoroidal symplectic form has simple non-contractible periodic orbits of arbitrarily large period, provided that the diffeomorphism has a non-degenerate (or even isolated and homologically non-trivial) periodic orbit with non-zero homology class and the set of one-periodic orbits in that class is finite.
