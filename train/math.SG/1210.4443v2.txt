We show that the path construction integration of Lie algebroids by Lie groupoids is an actual equivalence from the category of integrable Lie algebroids and complete Lie algebroid comorphisms to the category of source 1-connected Lie groupoids and Lie groupoid comorphisms. This allows us to construct an actual symplectization functor in Poisson geometry. We include examples to show that the integrability of comorphisms and Poisson maps may not hold in the absence of a completeness assumption.
