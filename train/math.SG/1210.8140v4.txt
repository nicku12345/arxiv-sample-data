In this paper we introduce a notion of front S^m-spinning for Legendrian submanifolds of R^{2n+1}. It generalizes the notion of front S^1-spinning which was invented by Ekholm, Etnyre and Sullivan. We use it to prove that there are infinitely many pairs of exact Lagrangian cobordant and not pairwise Legendrian isotopic Legendrian S^1 x S^{i_1} x ... x S^{i_k} in the standard contact Euclidean space which have the same classical invariants if one of i_j's is odd.
