Let the circle act holomorphically on a compact K\"ahler manifold M of complex dimension n with moment map \phi\colon M\to\R. Assume the critical set of \phi consists of 3 connected components, the extrema being isolated points. We show that M is equivariantly biholomorphic to \CP^n, where n\geq 2, or to \Tilde G_2(\R^{n+2}), the Grassmannian of oriented 2-planes in \R^{n+2}, where n\geq 3, with a standard circle action; we also show that M is equivariantly symplectomorphic to \CP^n, where n\geq 2, or to \Tilde G_2(\R^{n+2}), where n\geq 3, with a standard circle action.
