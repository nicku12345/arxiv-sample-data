Let V be a bounded domain with smooth boundary in \R^n, and D^*V denote its disc cotangent bundle. We compute symplectic homology of D^*V, in terms of relative homology of loop spaces on the closure of V. We use this result to show that Floer-Hofer capacity of D^*V is between 2r(V) and 2(n+1)r(V), where r(V) denotes inradius of V. As an application, we study periodic billiard trajectories on V.
