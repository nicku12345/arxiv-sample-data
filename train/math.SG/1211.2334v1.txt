T.-J. Li and W. Zhang defined an almost complex structure J on a manifold X to be {\em \Cpf}, if the second de Rham cohomology group can be decomposed as a direct sum of the subgroups whose elements are cohomology classes admitting J-invariant and J-anti-invariant representatives. It turns out (see T. Draghici, T.-J. Li and W. Zhang) that any almost complex structure on a 4-dimensional compact manifold is \Cpf. We study the J-invariant and J-anti-invariant cohomology subgroups on almost complex manifolds, possibly non compact. In particular, we prove an analytic continuation result for anti-invariant forms on almost complex manifolds.
