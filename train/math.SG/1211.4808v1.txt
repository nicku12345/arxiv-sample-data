In this paper we prove a recursion relation between the the one-point genus-0 gravitational descendants of a Stein domain (M,\partial M). This relation is best described by the degree -2 map D in the linearized contact homology of \partial M, arising from the Bourgeois--Oancea exact sequence between symplectic homology of M and linearized contact homology of \partial M. All one-point genus-0 gravitational descendants can be reduce to the one-point Gromov--Witten invariants via iterates of D.
