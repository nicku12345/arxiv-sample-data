In this paper, we study compact convex Lefschetz fibrations on compact convex symplectic manifolds (i.e., Liouville domains) of dimension 2n+2 which are introduced by Seidel and later also studied by McLean. By a result of Akbulut-Arikan, the open book on \partial W, which we call \emph{convex open book}, induced by a compact convex Lefschetz fibration on W carries the contact structure induced by the convex symplectic structure (i.e., Liouville structure) on W. Here we show that, up to a Liouville homotopy and a deformation of compact convex Lefschetz fibrations on W, any simply connected embedded Lagrangian submanifold of a page in a convex open book on \partial W can be assumed to be Legendrian in \partial W with the induced contact structure. This can be thought as the extension of Giroux's Legendrian realization (which holds for contact open books) for the case of convex open books. Moreover, a result of Akbulut-Arikan implies that there is a one-to-one correspondence between convex stabilizations of a convex open book and convex stabilizations of the corresponding compact convex Lefschetz fibration. We also show that the convex stabilization of a compact convex Lefschetz fibration on W yields a compact convex Lefschetz fibration on a Liouville domain W' which is exact symplectomorphic to a \emph{positive expansion} of W. In particular, with the induced structures \partial W and \partial W' are contactomorphic.
