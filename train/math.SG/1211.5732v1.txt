Let M be a closed symplectic manifold with a compatible almost complex structure J. We prove that for a point p in M and E>0, if v is a non-constant J-holomorphic curve with symplectic area smaller than E, then the number of the pre-images of p is bounded, and the bound is independent of v. We also provide a uniform Hofer's energy bound for J-holomorphic curves in M\p based on the symplectic area. Using these two results we compactify the moduli space of J-holomorphic curves in M by adding holomorphic buildings at the point p.
