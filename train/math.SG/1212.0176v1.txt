In this paper we introduce multiplicative Dirac structures on Lie groupoids, providing a unified framework to study both multiplicative Poisson bivectors (i.e., Poisson group(oid)s) and multiplicative closed 2-forms (e.g., symplectic groupoids). We prove that for every source simply connected Lie groupoid G with Lie algebroid AG, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between multiplicative Dirac structures on G and Dirac structures on AG, which are compatible with both the linear and algebroid structures of AG. We explain in what sense this extends the integration of Lie bialgebroids to Poisson groupoids carried out in \cite{MX2} and the integration of Dirac manifolds of \cite{BCWZ}. We also explain the connection between multiplicative Dirac structures and higher geometric structures such as \mathcal{LA}-groupoids and \mathcal{CA}-groupoids.
