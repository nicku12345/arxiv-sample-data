We consider Hamiltonian systems restricted to the hypersurfaces of contact type and obtain a partial version of the Arnold-Liouville theorem: the system not need to be integrable on the whole phase space, while the invariant hypersurface is foliated on an invariant Lagrangian tori. In the second part of the paper we consider contact systems with constraints. As an example, the Reeb flows on Brieskorn manifolds are considered.
