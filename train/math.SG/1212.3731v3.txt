We present three equivalent definitions of S^1-equivariant symplectic homology. We show that, using rational coefficients, the positive part of S^1-equivariant symplectic homology is isomorphic to linearized contact homology, when the latter is defined. We present several computations and applications, and introduce a rigorously defined substitute for cylindrical/linearized contact homology based on an S^1-equivariant construction.
