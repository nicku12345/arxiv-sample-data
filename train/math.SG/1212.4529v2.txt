Bordered Heegaard Floer homology is an invariant for 3-manifolds, which associates to a surface F an algebra A(Z), and to a 3-manifold Y with boundary, together with an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism \phi from F to \bdy Y, a module over A(Z). We study the Grothendieck group of modules over A(Z), and define an invariant lying in this group for every bordered 3-manifold. We prove that this invariant recovers the kernel of the inclusion of H_1(\bdy Y; Z) into H_1(Y; Z) if H_1(Y, \bdy Y; Z) is finite, and is 0 otherwise. We also study the properties of this invariant corresponding to gluing. As one application, we show that the pairing theorem for bordered Floer homology categorifies the classical Alexander polynomial formula for satellites.
