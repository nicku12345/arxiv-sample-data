We introduce a canonical affine connection on the contact manifold (Q,\xi), which is associated to each contact triad (Q,\lambda,J) where \lambda is a contact form and J:\xi \to \xi is an endomorphism with J^2 = -id compatible to d\lambda. We call it the \emph{contact triad connection} of (Q,\lambda,J) and prove its existence and uniqueness. The connection is canonical in that the pull-back connection \phi^*\nabla of a triad connection \nabla becomes the triad connection of the pull-back triad (Q, \phi^*\lambda, \phi^*J) for any diffeomorphism \phi:Q \to Q satisfying \phi^*\lambda = \lambda (sometimes called a strict contact diffeomorphism). It also preserves both the triad metric  g_{(\lambda,J)} = d\lambda(\cdot, J\cdot) + \lambda \otimes \lambda  and J regarded as an endomorphism on TQ = \mathbb R\{X_\lambda\}\oplus \xi, and is characterized by its torsion properties and the requirement that the contact form \lambda be holomorphic in the CR-sense. In particular, the connection restricts to a Hermitian connection \nabla^\pi on the Hermitian vector bundle (\xi,J,g_\xi) with g_\xi = d\lambda(\cdot, J\cdot)|_{\xi}, which we call the \emph{contact Hermitian connection} of (\xi,J,g_\xi). These connections greatly simplify tensorial calculations in the sequels \cite{oh-wang1}, \cite{oh-wang2} performed in the authors' analytic study of the map w, called contact instantons, which satisfy the nonlinear elliptic system of equations \overline{\partial}^\pi w = 0, \, d(w^*\lambda \circ j) = 0 in the contact triad (Q,\lambda,J).
