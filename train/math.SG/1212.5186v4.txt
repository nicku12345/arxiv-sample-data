In the present article, we develop the analysis of the following nonlinear elliptic system of equations  \bar\partial^\pi w = 0, \, d(w^*\lambda \circ j) = 0  first introduced by Hofer, associated to each given contact triad (M,\lambda,J) on a contact manifold (M,\xi). We directly work with this elliptic system on the contact manifold without involving the symplectization process. We establish the local a priori C^k coercive pointwise estimates for all k \geq 2 in terms of \|dw\|_{C^0} by doing tensorial calculations on contact manifold itself using the contact triad connection introduced by present the authors. Equipping the punctured Riemann surface (\dot \Sigma,j) with a cylindrical K\"ahler metric and isothermal coordinates near every puncture, we prove the asymptotic (subsequence) convergence to the `spiraling' instantons along the `rotating' Reeb orbit for any solution w, not necessarily for w^*\lambda \circ j being exact (i.e., allowing non-zero `charge' Q \neq 0), with bounded gradient \|d w\|_{C^0} < C and finite \pi-harmonic energy. For nondegenerate contact forms, we employ the `three-interval method' to prove the exponential convergence to a closed Reeb orbit when Q = 0. (The Morse-Bott case using this method is treated in a sequel (arXiv:1311.6196).)
