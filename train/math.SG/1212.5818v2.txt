Let M be a manifold and \Lambda a compact exact connected Lagrangian submanifold of T^*M. We can associate with \Lambda a conic Lagrangian submanifold \Lambda' of T^*(M\times R). We prove that there exists a canonical sheaf F on M\times R whose microsupport is \Lambda' outside the zero section. We deduce the already known results that the Maslov class of \Lambda is 0 and that the projection from \Lambda to M induces isomorphisms between the homotopy groups.
