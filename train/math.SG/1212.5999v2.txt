We study the relationship between several constructions of symplectic realizations of a given Poisson manifold. Our main result is a general formula for a formal symplectic realization in the case of an arbitrary Poisson structure on \R^n. This formula is expressed in terms of rooted trees and elementary differentials, building on the work of Butcher, and the coefficients are shown to be a generalization of Bernoulli numbers appearing in the linear Poisson case. We also show that this realization coincides with a formal version of the original construction of Weinstein, when suitably put in global Darboux form, and with the realization coming from tree-level part of Kontsevich's star product. We provide a simple iterated integral expression for the relevant coefficients and show that they coincide with underlying Kontsevich weights.
