We provide an explicit example of a non trivial Legendrian knot \Lambda such that there exists a Lagrangian concordance from \Lambda_0 to \Lambda where \Lambda_0 is the trivial Legendrian knot. We then use the map induced in Legendrian contact homology by a concordance and the augmentation category of \Lambda to show that no Lagrangian concordance exists in the other direction. This proves that the relation of Lagrangian concordance is not symmetric.
