For any stable curve f in an exploded manifold, this paper constructs a family of curves \hat f with universal tropical structure which contains f. Such a family has the property that any other family of curves containing f is locally a small modification of a family which factors through \hat f. As such, families of curves with universal tropical structure play an important role in the analysis of the moduli stack of curves and the construction of Gromov-Witten invariants of exploded manifolds.
