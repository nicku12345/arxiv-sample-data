In this paper we revisit a Poincare lemma for foliated forms, with respect to a regular foliation, and compute the foliated cohomology for local models of integrable systems with singularities of nondegenerate type. A key point in this computation is the use of some analytical tools for integrable systems with nondegenerate singularities, including a Poincare lemma for the deformation complex associated to this singular foliation.
