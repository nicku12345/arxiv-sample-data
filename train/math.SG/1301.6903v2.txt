We provide in this note two relevant examples of Lagrangian cobordisms. The first one gives an example of two exact Lagrangian submanifolds which cannot be composed in an exact fashion. The second one is an example of an exact Lagrangian cobordism on which all primitive of the Liouville form is not constant on the negative end and such that the positive end is a stabilisation whereas the negative end admits augmentations. These examples emphasise point (i) of the definition of exact Lagrangian cobordisms in [6]. In order to provide such examples we construct Lagrangian immersions with single double points using an explicit model and interpret such Lagrangians as cobordisms from the Hopf link.
