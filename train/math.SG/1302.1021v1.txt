We study the space of pseudo-holomorphic spheres in compact symplectic manifolds with convex boundary. We show that the theory of Gromov-Witten invariants can be extended to the class of semi-positive manifolds with convex boundary. This leads to a deformation of intersection products on the absolute and relative singular homologies. As a result, absolute and relative quantum homology algebras are defined analogously to the case of closed symplectic manifolds. In addition, we prove the Poincar\'{e}-Lefschetz duality for the absolute and relative quantum homology algebras.
