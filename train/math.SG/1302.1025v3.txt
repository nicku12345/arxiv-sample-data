We construct absolute and relative versions of Hamiltonian Floer homology algebras for strongly semi-positive compact symplectic manifolds with convex boundary, where the ring structures are given by the appropriate versions of the pair-of-pants products. We establish the absolute and relative Piunikhin-Salamon-Schwarz isomorphisms between these Floer homology algebras and the corresponding absolute and relative quantum homology algebras. As a result, the absolute and relative analogues of the spectral invariants on the group of compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms are defined.
