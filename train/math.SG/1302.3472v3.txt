We describe a program for proving that the Gromov-Witten moduli spaces of compact symplectic manifolds carry a unique virtual fundamental class that satisfies certain naturality conditions. The virtual fundamental class is constructed using only Ruan-Tian perturbations by introducing stabilizing divisors, using Cech homology, and systematically applying naturality conditions. In high dimensions or low genus, no gluing theorems are needed.
