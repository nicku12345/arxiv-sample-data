Let G be a Lie group, H a closed subgroup and M the homogeneous space G/H. Each representation \Psi of H determines a G-equivariant principal bundle {\mathcal P} on M endowed with a G-invariant connection. We consider subgroups {\mathcal G} of the diffeomorphism group {\rm Diff}(M), such that, each vector field Z\in{\rm Lie}({\mathcal G}) admits a lift to a preserving connection vector field on {\mathcal P}. We prove that #\,\pi_1({\mathcal G})\geq #\,\Psi(Z(G)). This relation is applicable to subgroups {\mathcal G} of the Hamiltonian groups of the flag varieties of a semisimple group G.   Let M_{\Delta} be the toric manifold determined by the Delzant polytope \Delta. We put \varphi_{\bf b} for the the loop in the Hamiltonian group of M_{\Delta} defined by the lattice vector {\bf b}. We give a sufficient condition, in terms of the mass center of \Delta, for the loops \varphi_{\bf b} and \varphi_{\bf\tilde b} to be homotopically inequivalent.
