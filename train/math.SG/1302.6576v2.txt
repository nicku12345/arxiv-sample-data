We study Liouville fillable contact manifolds (\Sigma,\xi) with non-zero Rabinowitz Floer homology and assign spectral numbers to paths of contactomorphisms. As a consequence we prove that \widetilde{\mathrm{Cont}_0}(\Sigma,\xi) is orderable in the sense of Eliashberg and Polterovich. This provides a new class of orderable contact manifolds. If the contact manifold is in addition periodic or a prequantization space M \times S^1 for M a Liouville manifold, then we construct a contact capacity. This can be used to prove a general non-squeezing result, which amongst other examples in particular recovers the beautiful non-squeezing results from [EKP06].
