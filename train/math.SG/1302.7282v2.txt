Assume M is a closed connected smooth manifold and H:T^*M->R a smooth proper function bounded from below. Suppose the sublevel set {H<d} contains the zero section and \alpha is a non-trivial homotopy class of free loops in M. Then for almost every s>=d the level set {H=s} carries a periodic orbit z of the Hamiltonian system (T^*M,\omega_0,H) representing \alpha.   Examples show that the condition that {H<d} contains M is necessary and almost existence cannot be improved to everywhere existence.
