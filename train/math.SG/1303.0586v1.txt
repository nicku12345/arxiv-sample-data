We establish an h-principle for exact Lagrangian embeddings with concave Legendrian boundary. We prove, in particular, that in the complement of the unit ball B in the standard symplectic \R^{2n}, 2n\geq 6, there exists an embedded Lagrangian n-disc transversely attached to B along its Legendrian boundary.
