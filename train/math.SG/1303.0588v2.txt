We establish an h-principle for exact Lagrangian immersions with transverse self-intersections and the minimal, or near-minimal number of double points. One corollary of our result is that any orientable closed 3-manifold admits an exact Lagrangian immersion into standard symplectic 6-space \R^6_\st with exactly one transverse double point. Our construction also yields a Lagrangian embedding S^1\times S^2\to\R^6_\st with vanishing Maslov class.
