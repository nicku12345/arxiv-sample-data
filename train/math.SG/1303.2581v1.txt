Fintushel and Stern defined the rational blow-down construction [FS] for smooth 4-manifolds, where a linear plumbing configuration of spheres C_n is replaced with a rational homology ball B_n, n \geq 2. Subsequently, Symington [Sy] defined this procedure in the symplectic category, where a symplectic C_n (given by symplectic spheres) is replaced by a symplectic copy of B_n to yield a new symplectic manifold. As a result, a symplectic rational blow-down can be performed on a manifold whenever such a configuration of symplectic spheres can be found. In this paper, we define the inverse procedure, the rational blow-up in the symplectic category, where we present the symplectic structure of B_n as an entirely standard symplectic neighborhood of a certain Lagrangian 2-cell complex. Consequently, a symplectic rational blow-up can be performed on a manifold whenever such a Lagrangian 2-cell complex is found.
