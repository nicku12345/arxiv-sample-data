Let G \subset GL(V) be a reductive algebraic subgroup acting on the symplectic vector space W=(V \oplus V^*)^{\oplus m}, and let \mu:\ W \rightarrow Lie(G)^* be the corresponding moment map. In this article, we use the theory of invariant Hilbert schemes to construct a canonical desingularization of the symplectic reduction \mu^{-1}(0)/\!/G for classes of examples where G=GL(V), O(V), or Sp(V). For these classes of examples, \mu^{-1}(0)/\!/G is isomorphic to the closure of a nilpotent orbit in a simple Lie algebra, and we compare the Hilbert-Chow morphism with the (well-known) symplectic desingularizations of \mu^{-1}(0)/\!/G.
