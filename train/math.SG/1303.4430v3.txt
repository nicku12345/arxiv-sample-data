In this paper, we provide a bound for the generalized Hofer energy of punctured J-holomorphic curves in almost complex manifolds with asymptotically cylindrical ends. As an application, we prove a version of Gromov's Monotonicity Theorem with multiplicity. Namely, for a closed symplectic manifold (M,\omega) with a compatible almost complex structure J and a ball B in M, there exists a constant \hbar>0, such that any J-holomorphic curve \tilde{u} passing through the center of B for k times (counted with multiplicity) with boundary mapped to \partial B has symplectic area \int_{\tilde{u}^{-1}(B)}\tilde{u}^{*}\omega>k\hbar, where the constant \hbar depends only on (M,\omega,J) and the radius of B. As a consequence, the number of times that any closed J-holomorphic curve in M passes through a point is bounded by a constant depending only on (M,\omega,J) and the symplectic area of \tilde{u}. Here J is any \omega-compatible smooth almost complex structure on M. In particular, we do not require J to be integrable.
