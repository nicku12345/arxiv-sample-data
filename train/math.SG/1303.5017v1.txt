In this paper we study a subspace of the space of Legendrian loops and we show that the injection of this space into the full loop space is an S1-equivariant homotopy equivalence. This space can be also seen as the space of zero Maslov index Legendrian loops and it shows up as a suitable space of variations in contact form geometry.
