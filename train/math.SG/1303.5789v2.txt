These notes give an introduction to embedded contact homology (ECH) of contact three-manifolds, gathering together many basic notions which are scattered across a number of papers. We also discuss the origins of ECH, including various remarks and examples which have not been previously published. Finally, we review the recent application to four-dimensional symplectic embedding problems. This article is based on lectures given in Budapest and Munich in the summer of 2012, a series of accompanying blog postings at floerhomology.wordpress.com, and related lectures at UC Berkeley in Fall 2012. There is already a brief introduction to ECH in the 2010 ICM proceedings, but the present notes give much more background and detail.
