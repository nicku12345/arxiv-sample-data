In this paper, we prove that there exist at least n geometrically distinct brake orbits on every C^2 compact convex symmetric hypersurface \Sg in \R^{2n} satisfying the reversible condition N\Sg=\Sg with N=\diag (-I_n,I_n). As a consequence, we show that if the Hamiltonian function is convex and even, then Seifert conjecture of 1948 on the multiplicity of brake orbits holds for any positive integer n.
