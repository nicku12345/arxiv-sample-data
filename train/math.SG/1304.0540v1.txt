Let (X,\sigma,J) be a compact K\"{a}hler Calabi-Yau manifold equipped with a symplectic circle action. By Frankel's theorem \cite{F}, the action on X is non-Hamiltonian and X does not have any fixed point. In this paper, we will show that a symplectic circle action on a compact non-K\"{a}hler symplectic Calabi-Yau manifold may have a fixed point. More precisely, we will show that the symplectic S^1-manifold constructed by D. McDuff \cite{McD} has the vanishing first Chern class. This manifold has the Betti numbers b_1 = 3, b_2 = 8, and b_3 = 12. In particular, it does not admit any K\"{a}hler structure.
