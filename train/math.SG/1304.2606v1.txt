This article is a standalone introduction to sutured Floer homology for graduate students in geometry and topology. It is divided into three parts. The first part is an introductory level exposition of Lagrangian Floer homology. The second part is a construction of Heegaard Floer homology as a special, and slightly modified, case of Lagrangian Floer homology. The third part covers the background on sutured manifolds, the definition of sutured Floer homology, as well as a discussion of its most basic properties and implications (it detects the product, behaves nicely under surface decompositions, defines an asymmetric polytope, its Euler characteristic is computable using Fox calculus).
