We study the existence of positive loops of contactomorphisms on a Liouville-fillable contact manifold (\Sigma,\xi=\ker(\alpha)). Previous results show that a large class of Liouville-fillable contact manifolds admit contractible positive loops. In contrast, we show that for any Liouville-fillable (\Sigma,\alpha) with \dim(\Sigma) \geq 7, there exists a Liouville-fillable contact structure \xi' on \Sigma which admits no positive loop at all. Further, \xi' can be chosen to agree with \xi on the complement of a Darboux ball.
