Let Z be a hypersurface of a manifold M. The b-tangent bundle of (M, Z), whose sections are vector fields tangent to Z, is used to study pseudodifferential operators and stable Poisson structures on M. In this paper we introduce the b^k-tangent bundle, whose sections are vector fields with "order k tangency" to Z. We describe the geometry of this bundle and its dual, generalize the celebrated Mazzeo-Melrose theorem of the de Rham theory of b-manifolds, and apply these tools to classify certain Poisson structures on compact oriented surfaces.
