We define hypersymplectic structures on Lie algebroids recovering, as particular cases, all the classical results and examples of hypersymplectic structures on manifolds. We prove a 1-1 correspondence theorem between hypersymplectic structures and (pseudo-)hyperk\"{a}hler structures. We show that the hypersymplectic framework is very rich in already known compatible pairs of tensors such as Poisson-Nijenhuis, \Omega N and P \Omega structures.
