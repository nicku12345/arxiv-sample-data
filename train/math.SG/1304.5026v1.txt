This paper is a rigorous study of two dual pairs of momentum maps arising in the context of fluid equations whose configuration Lie group is the group of automorphism of a trivial principal bundle, generically called here non-abelian fluids. It is shown that the actions involved are mutually completely orthogonal, which directly implies the dual pair property.
