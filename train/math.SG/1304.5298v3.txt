This article studies the symplectic cohomology of affine algebraic surfaces that admit a compactification by a normal crossings anticanonical divisor. Using a toroidal structure near the compactification divisor, we describe the complex computing symplectic cohomology, and compute enough differentials to identify a basis for the degree-zero part of the symplectic cohomology. This basis is indexed by integral points in a certain integral affine manifold, providing a relationship to the theta functions of Gross--Hacking--Keel. Included is a discussion of wrapped Floer cohomology of Lagrangian submanifolds and a description of the product structure in a special case. We also show that, after enhancing the coefficient ring, the degree--zero symplectic cohomology defines a family degenerating to a singular surface obtained by gluing together several affine planes.
