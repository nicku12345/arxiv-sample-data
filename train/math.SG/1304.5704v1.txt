We introduce a Hilbert A-module structure on the higher oscillatory module, where A denotes the C^*-algebra of bounded endomorphisms of the basic oscillatory module. We also define the notion of an exterior covariant derivative in an A-Hilbert bundle and use it for a construction of an A-elliptic complex of differential operators for certain symplectic manifolds equipped with a symplectic connection.
