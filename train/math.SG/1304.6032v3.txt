Given a symplectic manifold M, we consider a category with objects finite ordered families of Lagrangian submanifolds of M (subject to certain additional constraints) and with morphisms Lagrangian cobordisms relating them. We construct a functor that maps this category to a variant of the derived Fukaya category of M in a way that takes into account the triangulated structure of the latter.
