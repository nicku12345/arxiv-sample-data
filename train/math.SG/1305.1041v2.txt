In this note we prove that the symplectic homology of a Liouville domain W displaceable in the symplectic completion vanishes. Nevertheless if the Euler characteristic of (W,\p W) is odd, the filtered symplectic homologies of W do not vanish and give rise to leafwise intersection points on the symplectic completion of W for a perturbation displacing W from itself. In contrast to the existing results we can find a leafwise intersection point for a given period but its energy varies by period instead.
