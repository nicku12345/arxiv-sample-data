We classify nonabelian extensions of Lie algebroids in the holomorphic category. Moreover we study a spectral sequence associated to any such extension. This spectral sequence generalizes the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for Lie algebras to the holomorphic Lie algebroid setting. As an application, we show that the hypercohomology of the Atiyah algebroid of a line bundle has a natural Hodge structure.
