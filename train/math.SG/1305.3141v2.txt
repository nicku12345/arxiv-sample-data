In this article we define and compute the Novikov Floer homology associated to a non-resonant magnetic field and a mechanical Hamiltonian on a flat torus T^{2N}. As a result, we deduce that this Hamiltonian system always has 2N+1 contractible solutions, and generically even 2^{2N} contractible solutions. Moreover if there exists a non-degenerate non-contractible solution then there necessarily exists another.
