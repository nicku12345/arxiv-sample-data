In this paper, we prove there exist at least four geometrically distinct closed characteristics on every compact convex hypersurface \Sg in \R^8. This gives a confirmed answer in the case n=4 to a long standing conjecture in Hamiltonian analysis since the time of A. M. Liapounov in 1892 (cf. P. 235 of \cite{Eke3}).
