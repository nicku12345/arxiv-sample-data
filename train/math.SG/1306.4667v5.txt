We make the elementary observation that the Lagrangian submanifolds of \mathbb{C}^n, for each n \ge 3, constructed by Ekholm, Eliashberg, Murphy and Smith are non-uniruled and moreover have infinite relative Gromov width. The construction of these submanifolds use exact Lagrangian caps, which obviously are non-uniruled in themselves. This property is also used to show that if a Legendrian submanifold inside a 1-jet space admits an exact Lagrangian cap then its Legendrian contact homology DGA is acyclic.
