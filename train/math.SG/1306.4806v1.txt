In [GM], a family of parabolic Higgs bundles on CP^1 has been constructed and identified with a moduli space of hyperpolygons. Our aim here is to give a canonical alternative construction of this family. This enables us to compute the Higgs symplectic form for this family and show that the isomorphism of [GM] is a symplectomorphism.
