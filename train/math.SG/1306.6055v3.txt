We prove a normal form theorem for Poisson structures around Poisson transversals (also called cosymplectic submanifolds), which simultaneously generalizes Weinstein's symplectic neighborhood theorem from symplectic geometry and Weinstein's splitting theorem. Our approach turns out to be essentially canonical, and as a byproduct, we obtain an equivariant version of the latter theorem.
