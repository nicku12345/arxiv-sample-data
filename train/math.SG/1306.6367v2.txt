In this note we study several aspects of coisotropic submanifolds of a contact manifold. In particular we give a structure theorem for the singularity of the characteristic foliation of a coisotropic submanifold. Moreover we establish the existence and uniqueness results of germs of contact structures near Legendrian foliations, which is a special case of coisotropic submanifold. This note can be thought of as an attempt to generalize the study of surfaces in three-dimensional contact geometry to higher dimensions.
