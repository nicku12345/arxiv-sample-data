In this paper, we investigate the relationship between J-anti-invariant cohomology of a closed symplectic 4-manifold introduced by T.-J. Li and W. Zhang and new symplectic cohomologies introduced by L.-S. Tseng and S.-T. Yau. We also prove that the dimension of J-anti-invariant cohomology is constant for almost structures J which are compatible with a fixed symplectic form.
