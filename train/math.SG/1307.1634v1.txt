We prove that the kernels of the restrictions of symplectic Dirac or symplectic Dirac-Dolbeault operators on natural subspaces of polynomial valued spinor fields are finite dimensional on a compact symplectic manifold. We compute those kernels for the complex projective spaces. We construct injections of subgroups of the symplectic group (the pseudo-unitary group and the stabilizer of a Lagrangian subspace) in the group Mpc and classify G-invariant Mpc-structures on symplectic spaces with a G-action. We prove a variant of Parthasarathy's formula for the commutator of two symplectic Dirac-type operators on a symmetric symplectic space.
