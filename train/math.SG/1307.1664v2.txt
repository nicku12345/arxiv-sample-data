In this work we study homeomorphisms of closed orientable surfaces homotopic to the identity, focusing on the existence of non-contractible periodic orbits. We show that, if g is such a homeomorphism, and if \hat g is its lift to the universal covering of S that commutes with the deck transformations, then one of the following three conditions must be satisfied: (1) The set of fixed points for \hat g projects to a closed subset F which contains an essential continuum, (2) g has non-contratible periodic points of every sufficiently large period, or (3) there exists an uniform bound M such that, if \hat x projects to a contractible periodic point then the \hat g orbit of \hat x has diameter less or equal to M. Some consequences for homeomorphisms of surfaces whose rotation set is a singleton are derived.
