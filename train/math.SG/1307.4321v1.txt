The rational homology balls B_n appeared in Fintushel and Stern's rational blow-down construction [FS2]. Later, Symington [Sy1], defined this operation in the symplectic category. In [Kh2], the author defined the inverse procedure, the symplectic rational blow-up. In this paper, we study the obstructions to symplectically rationally blowing up a symplectic 4-manifold, i.e. the obstructions to symplectically embedding the rational homology balls B_n into a symplectic 4-manifold. We prove a theorem and give additional examples which suggest that in order to symplectically embed the rational homology balls B_n, for high n, a symplectic 4-manifold must at least have a high enough c_1^2 as well.
