It is shown that non-negative Legendrian isotopy defines a partial order on the universal cover of the Legendrian isotopy class of the fibre of the spherical cotangent bundle of any manifold. This result is applied to Lorentz geometry in the spirit of the authors' earlier work on the Legendrian Low conjecture.
