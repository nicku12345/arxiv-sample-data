Two natural symplectic constructions, the Lagrangian suspension and Seidel's quantum representation of the fundamental group of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, Ham(M), with (M,\omega) a monotone symplectic manifold, admit categorifications as actions of the fundamental groupoid \Pi(Ham(M)) on a cobordism category recently introduced in \cite{Bi-Co:cob2} and, respectively, on a monotone variant of the derived Fukaya category. We show that the functor constructed in \cite{Bi-Co:cob2} that maps the cobordism category to the derived Fukaya category is equivariant with respect to these actions.
