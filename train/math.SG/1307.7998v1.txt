We construct infinitely many Legendrian links in the standard contact \mathbb{R}^3 with arbitrarily many topologically distinct Lagrangian fillings. The construction is used to find links in S^3 that bound topologically distinct pieces of algebraic curves in B^4 \subset \mathbb{C}^2, is applied to find contact 3-manifolds with topologically distinct symplectic fillings, and is generalized to higher dimensions.
