Suppose G is a connected complex Lie group and \Gamma is a discrete subgroup such that X := G/\Gamma is K\"ahler and the codimension of the top non--vanishing homology group of X with coefficients in \mathbb Z_2 is less than or equal to two. We show that G is solvable and a finite covering of X is biholomorphic to a product C\times A, where C is a Cousin group and A is \{e \}, \mathbb C, \mathbb C^*, or \mathbb C^*\times\mathbb C^*.
