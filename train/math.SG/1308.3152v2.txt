We define a homology \mathcal{H}_N for closed braids by applying Khovanov and Rozansky's matrix factorization construction with potential ax^{N+1}. Up to a grading shift, \mathcal{H}_0 is the HOMFLYPT homology defined in arXiv:math/0505056. We demonstrate that, for N \geq 1, \mathcal{H}_N is a \mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}^{\oplus 3}-graded \mathbb{Q}[a]-module that is invariant under transverse Markov moves, but not under negative stabilization/de-stabilization. Thus, for N\geq 1, this homology is an invariant for transverse links in the standard contact S^3, but not for smooth links. We also discuss the decategorification of \mathcal{H}_N and the relation between \mathcal{H}_N and the \mathfrak{sl}(N) Khovanov-Rozansky homology defined in arXiv:math/0401268.
