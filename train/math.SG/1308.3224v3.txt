We build homogeneous quasi-morphisms on the universal cover of the contactomorphism group for certain prequantizations of monotone symplectic toric manifolds. This is done using Givental's nonlinear Maslov index and a contact reduction technique for quasi-morphisms. We show how these quasi-morphisms lead to a hierarchy of rigid subsets of contact manifolds. We also show that the nonlinear Maslov index has a vanishing property, which plays a key role in our proofs. Finally we present applications to orderability of contact manifolds and Sandon-type metrics on contactomorphism groups.
