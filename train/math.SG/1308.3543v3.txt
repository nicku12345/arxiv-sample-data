Resonance relations among periodic orbits on given energy hypersurfaces are very important for getting deeper understanding of the dynamics of the corresponding Hamiltonian systems. In this paper, we establish two new resonance identities for closed characteristics on every compact star-shaped hypersurface \Sigma in {\bf R}^{2n} when the number of geometrically distinct closed characteristics on \Sigma is finite, which extend those identities established by C. Viterbo in 1989 for star-shaped hypersurfaces assuming in addition that all the closed characteristics and their iterates are non-degenerate, and that by W. Wang, X. Hu and Y. Long in 2007 for strictly convex hypersurfaces in {\bf R}^{2n}.
