The graph of a real symplectic linear transformation is an R-Lagrangian subspace of a complex symplectic vector space. The restriction of the complex symplectic form is thus purely imaginary and may be expressed in terms of the generating function of the transformation. We provide explicit formulas; moreover, as an application, we give an explicit general formula for the metaplectic representation of the real symplectic group.
