We embed triangulated categories defined by quivers with potential arising from ideal triangulations of marked bordered surfaces into Fukaya categories of quasi-projective 3-folds associated to meromorphic quadratic differentials. Together with previous results, this yields non-trivial computations of spaces of stability conditions on Fukaya categories of symplectic 6-manifolds.
