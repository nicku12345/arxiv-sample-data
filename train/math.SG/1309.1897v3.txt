We study Hamiltonian actions on b-symplectic manifolds with a focus on the effective case of half the dimension of the manifold. In particular, we prove a Delzant-type theorem that classifies these manifolds using polytopes that reside in a certain enlarged and decorated version of the dual of the Lie algebra of the torus.
