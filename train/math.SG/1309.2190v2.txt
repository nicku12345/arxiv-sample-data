For a finite dimensional symplectic manifold (M,\omega) with a symplectic form \omega, corresponding loop space (LM=C^\infty(S^1,M)) admits a weak symplectic form \Omega^\omega. We prove that the loop space over \mbr^n admits Darboux chart for the weak symplectic structure \Omega^\omega. Further, we show that inclusion map from the symplectic cohomology (as defined by Kriegl and Michor \cite{KM}) of the loop space over \mathbb R^n to the De Rham cohomology of the loop space is an isomorphism.
