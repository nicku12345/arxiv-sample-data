We study the existence of symplectic resolutions of quotient singularities V/G where V is a symplectic vector space and G acts symplectically. Namely, we classify the symplectically irreducible and imprimitive groups, excluding those of the form K \rtimes S_2 where K < \SL_2(\C), for which the corresponding quotient singularity admits a projective symplectic resolution. As a consequence, for \dim V \neq 4, we classify all quotient singularities V/G admitting a projective symplectic resolution which do not decompose as a product of smaller-dimensional quotient singularities, except for at most four explicit singularities, that occur in dimensions at most 10, for whom the question of existence remains open.
