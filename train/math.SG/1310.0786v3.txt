In this article we prove that the Weinstein conjecture holds for contact manifolds (\Sigma,\xi) for which \mathrm{Cont}_0(\Sigma,\xi) is non-orderable in the sense of Eliashberg-Polterovich [EP00]. More precisely, we establish a link between orderable and hypertight contact manifolds. In addition, we prove for certain contact manifolds a conjecture by Sandon [San13b] on the existence of translated points in the non-degenerate case.
