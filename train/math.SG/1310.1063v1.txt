We prove that any perturbation of the symplectic part of the derivative of a Poisson diffeomorphism can be realized as the derivative of a C^1-close Poisson diffeomorphism. We also show that a similar property holds for the Poincar\'e map of a Hamiltonian on a Poisson manifold. These results are the conservative counterparts of the Franks lemma, a perturbation tool used in several contexts most notably in the theory of smooth dynamical systems.
