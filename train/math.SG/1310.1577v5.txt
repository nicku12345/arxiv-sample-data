We show that an exact Lagrangian cobordism L\subset \mathbb R \times P \times \mathbb R from a Legendrian submanifold \Lambda\subset P\times \mathbb R to itself satisfies H_i(L;\mathbb F)=H_i(\Lambda;\mathbb F) for any field \mathbb F in the case when \Lambda admits a spin exact Lagrangian filling and the concatenation of any spin exact Lagrangian filling of \Lambda and L is also spin. The main tool used is Seidel's isomorphism in wrapped Floer homology. In contrast to that, for loose Legendrian submanifolds of \mathbb{C}^n \times \mathbb R, we construct examples of such cobordisms whose homology groups have arbitrary high ranks. In addition, we prove that the front S^m-spinning construction preserves looseness, which implies certain forgetfulness properties of it.
