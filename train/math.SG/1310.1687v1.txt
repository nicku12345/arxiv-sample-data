Let M be a smooth manifold and G a compact connected Lie group acting on M by isometries. In this paper, we study the equivariant cohomology of {\bf X}=T^\ast M, and relate it to the cohomology of the Marsden-Weinstein reduced space via certain residue formulae. In case that \bf X is a compact symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian G-action, similar residue formulae were derived by Jeffrey, Kirwan et al.
