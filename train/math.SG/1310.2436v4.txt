Let X be a toric Fano manifold and denote by Crit(f_X) \subset (\mathbb{C}^{\ast})^n the solution scheme of the corresponding Landau-Ginzburg system of equations. For toric Del-Pezzo surfaces and various toric Fano threefolds we define a map L : Crit(f_X) \rightarrow Pic(X) such that \mathcal{E}_L(X) : = L(Crit(f_X)) \subset Pic(X) is a full strongly exceptional collection of line bundles. We observe the existence of a natural monodromy map  M : \pi_1(L(X) \setminus R_X,f_X) \rightarrow Aut(Crit(f_X)) where L(X) is the space of all Laurent polynomials whose Newton polytope is equal to the Newton polytope of f_X, the Landau-Ginzburg potential of X, and R_X \subset L(X) is the space of all elements whose corresponding solution scheme is reduced. We show that monodromies of Crit(f_X) admit non-trivial relations to quiver representations of the exceptional collection \mathcal{E}_L(X). We refer to this property as the M-aligned property of the maps L: Crit(f_X) \rightarrow Pic(X). We discuss possible applications of the existence of such M-aligned exceptional maps to various aspects of mirror symmetry of toric Fano manifolds.
