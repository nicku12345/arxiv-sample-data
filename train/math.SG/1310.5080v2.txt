The main goal of this paper is to give a unified treatment to many known cuplength estimates. As the base case, we prove that for C^0-perturbations of a function which is Morse-Bott along a closed submanifold, the number of critical points is bounded below in terms of the cuplength of that critical submanifold. As we work with rather general assumptions the proof also applies in a variety of Floer settings. For example, this proves lower bounds for the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, Hamiltonian chords for Lagrangian submanifolds, translated points of contactomorphisms, and solutions to a Dirac-type equation.
