Let T be a compact torus and (M,\omega) a Hamiltonian T-space. We give a new proof of the K-theoretic analogue of the Kirwan surjectivity theorem in symplectic geometry by using the equivariant version of the Kirwan map introduced in one of R. Goldin's papers. We compute the kernel of this equivariant Kirwan map, and hence give a computation of the kernel of the Kirwan map. As an application, we find the presentation of the kernel of the Kirwan map for the T-equivariant K-theory of flag varieties G/T where G is a compact, connected and simply-connected Lie group. In the last section, we find explicit formulae for the K-theory of weight varieties.
