In order to establish Fredholm theory on stratified topological Banach manifolds in Gromov-Witten theory, we have introduced flat structures on such manifolds in [L4]. Such a structure is obtained from local flat coordinate charts. The transformations between these charts are only continuous in general. The purpose of this paper is two-fold : firstly to show that on the topological Banach manifolds and bundles appeared in Gromov-Witten and Floer type theories, there are enough smooth functions and sections viewed in any admissible charts and trivializations; secondly to demonstrate some finer aspects about the weakly smooth sections.
