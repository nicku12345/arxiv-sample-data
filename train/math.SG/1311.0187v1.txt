The Gromov-Eliashberg theorem says that the group of symplectomorphisms of a symplectic manifold is C^0-closed in the group of diffeomorphisms. This can be translated into a statement about the Lagrangian submanifolds which are graphs of symplectomorphisms. It is also known that such Lagrangian submanifolds are locally microsupports of sheaves. We explain how we can deduce the Gromov-Eliashberg theorem from the involutivity theorem of Kashiwara and Schapira which says that the microsupport of a sheaf is coisotropic.
