In this paper we address what generalized geometric structures are possible on products of spaces that each admit generalized geometries. In particular we consider, first, the product of two odd dimensional spaces that each admit a generalized almost contact structure, and then subsequently, the product of an odd dimensional space that admits a generalized almost contact structure and an even dimensional space that admits a generalized almost complex structure. We also draw attention to the relationship of the Courant bracket to the classical notion of normality for almost contact structures.
