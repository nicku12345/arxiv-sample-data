The aim of the paper is three-fold. We begin by proving a formula, both global and local versions, relating the number of periodic orbits of an iterated map and the Lefschetz numbers, or indices in the local case, of its iterations. This formula is then used to express the mean Euler characteristic (MEC) of a contact manifold in terms of local, purely topological, invariants of closed Reeb orbits, without any non-degeneracy assumption on the orbits. Finally, turning to applications of the local MEC formula to dynamics, we use it to reprove a theorem asserting the existence of at least two closed Reeb orbits on the standard contact three-sphere (by Cristofaro-Gardiner and Hutchings in the most general form) and the existence of at least two closed geodesics for a Finsler metric on the two-sphere (Bangert and Long).
