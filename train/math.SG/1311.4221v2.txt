We consider a 3-manifold M equipped with nondegenerate contact form \lambda and compatible almost complex structure J. We show that if the data (M, \lambda, J) admits a stable finite energy foliation, then for a generic choice of distinct points p, q\in M, the manifold M' formed by taking the connected sum at p and q admits a nondegenerate contact form \lambda' and compatible almost complex structure J' so that the data (M', \lambda', J') also admits a stable finite energy foliation. Along the way, we develop some general theory for the study of finite energy foliations.
