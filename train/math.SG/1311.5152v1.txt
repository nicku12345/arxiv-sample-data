We consider various constructions of monotone Lagrangian submanifolds of C P^n, S^2\times S^2, and quadric hypersurfaces of C P^n. In S^2\times S^2 and C P^2 we show that several different known constructions of exotic monotone tori yield results that are Hamiltonian isotopic to each other, in particular answering a question of Wu by showing that the monotone fiber of a toric degeneration model of C P^2 is Hamiltonian isotopic to the Chekanov torus. Generalizing our constructions to higher dimensions leads us to consider monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (typically not tori) of quadrics and of C P^n which can be understood either in terms of the geodesic flow on T^*S^n or in terms of the Biran circle bundle construction. Unlike previously-known monotone Lagrangian submanifolds of closed simply connected symplectic manifolds, many of our higher-dimensional Lagrangian submanifolds are provably displaceable.
