For a Hamiltonian, proper and free action of a Lie group G on a Dirac manifold (M,L), with a regular moment map \mu:M\to \mathfrak{g}^*, the manifolds M/G, \mu^{-1}(0) and \mu^{-1}(0)/G all have natural induced Dirac structures. If (M,L) is an integrable Dirac structure, we show that M/G is always integrable, but \mu^{-1}(0) and \mu^{-1}(0)/G may fail to be integrable, and we describe the obstructions to their integrability.
