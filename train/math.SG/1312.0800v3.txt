We give an introduction to the physics and mathematics involved in the recently observed relation between topological string theory and knot contact homology and then discuss this relation. The note is based on two lectures given at the Gokova Geometry and Topology Conference, 2013 and reports on joint work by Aganagic, Ng, Vafa, and the author.
