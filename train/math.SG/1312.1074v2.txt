We consider Riemann surfaces obtained from nodal curves with infinite cylinders in the place of nodal and marked points, and study the space of finite energy vortices defined on these surfaces. To compactify the space of vortices, we need to consider stable vortices - these incorporate breaking of cylinders and sphere bubbling in the fibers. In this paper, we prove that the space of gauge equivalence classes of stable vortices representing a fixed equivariant homology class is compact and Hausdorff under the Gromov topology. We also show that this space is homeomorphic to the moduli space of quasimaps defined by Ciocan-Fontanine, Kim and Maulik.
