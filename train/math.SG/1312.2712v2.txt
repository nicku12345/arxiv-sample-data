Given a contact manifold M_# together with a transversal infinitesimal automorphism \xi, we show that any local leaf space M for the foliation determined by \xi naturally carries a conformally symplectic (cs-) structure. Then we show that the Rumin complex on M_# descends to a complex of differential operators on M, whose cohomology can be computed. Applying this construction locally, one obtains a complex intrinsically associated to any manifold endowed with a cs-structure, which recovers the generalization of the so-called Rumin-Seshadri complex to the conformally symplectic setting. The cohomology of this more general complex can be computed using the push-down construction.
