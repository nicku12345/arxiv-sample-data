The degeneracy locus of a generically symplectic Poisson structure on a Fano manifold is always a singular hypersurface. We prove that there exists just one family of generically symplectic Poisson structures in Fano manifold with cyclic Picard group having a reduced simple normal crossing degeneracy locus.
