We define the S^1-equivariant Rabinowitz-Floer homology of a bounding contact hypersurface \Sigma in an exact symplectic manifold, and show by a geometric argument that it vanishes if \Sigma is displaceable.   In the appendix we describe an approach to transversality for Floer homologies for which the moduli space \widehat M_J of all gradient flow lines is compact for some almost complex structure J. This approach uses a large set of perturbations, namely vector fields on the loop space, and selects from the possibly non-compact perturbed moduli spaces a part near \widehat M_J that turns out to be compact for small enough perturbations.
