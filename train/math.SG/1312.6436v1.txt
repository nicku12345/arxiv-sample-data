We study higher-degree generalizations of symplectic groupoids, referred to as {\em multisymplectic groupoids}. Recalling that Poisson structures may be viewed as infinitesimal counterparts of symplectic groupoids, we describe "higher'' versions of Poisson structures by identifying the infinitesimal counterparts of multisymplectic groupoids. Some basic examples and features are discussed.
