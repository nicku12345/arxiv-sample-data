Let (M,\omega) be a 2n-dimensional smooth compact symplectic manifold equipped with a Hamiltonian circle action with only isolated fixed points and let \mu : M \rightarrow \R be a corresponding moment map. Let \Lambda_{2k} be the set of all fixed points of index 2k. In this paper, we will show that if \mu is constant on \Lambda_{2k} for each k, then (M,\omega) satisfies the hard Lefschetz property. In particular, if (M,\omega) admits a self-indexing moment map, i.e. \mu(p) = 2k for every p \in \Lambda_{2k} and k=0,1,\cdots,n, then (M,\omega) satisfies the hard Lefschetz property.
