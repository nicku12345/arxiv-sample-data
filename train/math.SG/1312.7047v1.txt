In this paper, we first study the Poisson reductions of controlled Hamiltonian (CH) system and symmetric CH system by controllability distributions. These reductions are the extension of Poisson reductions by distribution for Poisson manifolds to that for phase spaces of CH systems with external force and control. We give Poisson reducible conditions of CH system by controllability distribution, and prove that the Poisson reducible property for CH systems leaves invariant under the CH-equivalence. Moreover, we study the Poisson reduction of symmetric CH system by G-invariant controllability distribution. Next, we consider the singular Poisson reduction and SPR-CH-equivalence for CH system with symmetry, and prove the singular Poisson reduction theorem of CH system. We also study the relationship between Poisson reduction for singular Poisson reducible CH systems by G-invariant controllability distribution and that for associated reduced CH system by reduced controllability distribution. At last, some examples are given to state the theoretical results.
