A Poisson manifold (M^{2n},\p) is b-symplectic if \bigwedge^n\p is transverse to the zero section. In this paper we apply techniques native to Symplectic Topology to address questions pertaining to b-symplectic manifolds. We provide constructions of b-symplectic structures on open manifolds by Gromov's h-principle, and of b-symplectic manifolds with a prescribed singular locus, by means of surgeries.
