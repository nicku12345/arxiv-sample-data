We introduce the notion of a symplectic capacity relative to a coisotropic submanifold of a symplectic manifold, and we construct two examples of such capacities through modifications of the Hofer-Zehnder capacity. As a consequence, we obtain a non-squeezing theorem for symplectic embeddings relative to coisotropic constraints and existence results for leafwise chords on energy surfaces.
