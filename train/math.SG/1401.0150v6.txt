We incorporate pearly Floer trajectories into the transversality scheme for pseudoholomorphic maps introduced by Cieliebak-Mohnke. By choosing generic domain-dependent almost complex structures we obtain zero and one-dimensional moduli spaces with the structure of cell complexes with rational fundamental classes. This gives a definition of Floer cohomology over Novikov rings via stabilizing divisors for compact symplectic manifolds with rational symplectic classes and Lagrangians that are fixed point sets of anti-symplectic involutions satisfying certain Maslov index conditions, in particular, Hamiltonian Floer cohomology.
