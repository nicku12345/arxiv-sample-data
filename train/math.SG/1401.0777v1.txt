We examine symplectic topological features of certain family of monotone Lagrangian submanifolds in CP^n. Firstly, we give a cohomological restriction for Lagrangian submanifolds in CP^n whose first integral homologies are 3-torsion. In particular, in the case where n=5,8, we prove the cohomologies with coefficients in Z_2 of such Lagrangian submanifolds are isomorphic to that of SU(3)/(SO(3) Z_3) and SU(3)/Z_3, respectively. Secondly, we calculate the Floer cohomology of a monotone Lagrangian submanifold SU(p)/Z_p in CP^{p^2-1} with coefficients in Z_2 by using Biran-Cornea's theory.
