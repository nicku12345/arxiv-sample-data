We prove a remarkable generalization of a convexity theorem for semisimple symmetric spaces G/H established earlier in 1986 by the second named author. The latter result generalized Kostant's non-linear convexity theorem for the Iwasawa decomposition of a real semisimple Lie group.   The present generalization involves Iwasawa decompositions related to minimal parabolic subgroups of G of arbitrary type instead of the particular type relative to H considered in 1986.
