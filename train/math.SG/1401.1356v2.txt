A real Liouville domain is a Liouville domain together with an exact anti-symplectic involution. We call a real Liouville domain uniruled if there exists an invariant finite energy plane through every real point. Asymptotically an invariant finite energy plane converges to a symmetric periodic orbit. In this note we work out a criterion which guarantees uniruledness for real Liouville domains.
