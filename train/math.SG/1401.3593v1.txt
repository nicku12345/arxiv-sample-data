Given an integer \kappa\geq2, we introduce a class of nearly integrable systems on \mathbb{A}^3, of the form  H_n(\theta,r)=\frac12 \Vert r\Vert ^2+\tfrac{1}{n} U(\theta_2,\theta_3)+f_n(\theta,r)  where U\in C^\kappa(\mathbb{T}^2) is a generic potential function and f_n a C^{\kappa-1} additional perturbation such that \Vert f_n\Vert_{C^{\kappa-1}(\mathbb{A}^3)}\leq \tfrac{1}{n}, so that H_n is a perturbation of the completely integrable system h(r)=\frac12\Vert r\Vert ^2.   Let \Pi:\mathbb{A}^3\to\mathbb{R}^3 be the canonical projection. We prove that for each \delta>0, there exists n_0 such that for n\geq n_0, the system H_n admits an orbit \Gamma_n at energy \frac12 whose projection \Pi(\Gamma_n) is \delta-dense in \Pi(H_n^{-1}(\tfrac{1}{2})), in the sense that the \delta-neighborhood of \Pi(\Gamma_n) in \mathbb{R}^3 covers \Pi(H_n^{-1}(\frac{1}{2})).
