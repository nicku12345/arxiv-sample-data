Let M be a Calabi-Yau m-fold, and consider compact, graded Lagrangians L in M. Thomas and Yau math.DG/0104196, math.DG/0104197 conjectured that there should be a notion of "stability" for such L, and that if L is stable then Lagrangian mean curvature flow \{L^t:t\in[0,\infty)\} with L^0=L should exist for all time, and L^\infty=\lim_{t\to\infty}L^t should be the unique special Lagrangian in the Hamiltonian isotopy class of L. This paper is an attempt to update the Thomas-Yau conjectures, and discuss related issues.   It is a folklore conjecture that there exists a Bridgeland stability condition (Z,\mathcal P) on the derived Fukaya category D^b\mathcal F(M) of M, such that an isomorphism class in D^b\mathcal F(M) is (Z,\mathcal P)-semistable if (and possibly only if) it contains a special Lagrangian, which must then be unique.   We conjecture that if (L,E,b) is an object in an enlarged version of D^b\mathcal F(M), where L is a compact, graded Lagrangian in M (possibly immersed, or with "stable singularities"), E\to M a rank one local system, and b a bounding cochain for (L,E) in Lagrangian Floer cohomology, then there is a unique family \{(L^t,E^t,b^t):t\in[0,\infty)\} such that (L^0,E^0,b^0)=(L,E,b), and (L^t,E^t,b^t)\cong(L,E,b) in D^b\mathcal F(M) for all t, and \{L^t:t\in[0,\infty)\} satisfies Lagrangian MCF with surgeries at singular times T_1,T_2,\dots, and in graded Lagrangian integral currents we have \lim_{t\to\infty}L^t=L_1+\cdots+L_n, where L_j is a special Lagrangian integral current of phase e^{i\pi\phi_j} for \phi_1>\cdots>\phi_n, and (L_1,\phi_1),\ldots,(L_n,\phi_n) correspond to the decomposition of (L,E,b) into (Z,\mathcal P)-semistable objects.   We also give detailed conjectures on the nature of the singularities of Lagrangian MCF that occur at the finite singular times T_1,T_2,\ldots.
