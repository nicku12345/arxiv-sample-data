We investigate the fine structure of the simplectic foliations of Poisson homogeneous spaces. Two general results are proved for weak splittings of surjective Poisson submersions from Heisenberg and Drinfeld doubles. The implications of these results are that the torus orbits of symplectic leaves of the quotients can be explicitly realized as Poisson-Dirac submanifolds of the torus orbits of the doubles. The results have a wide range of applications to many families of real and complex Poisson structures on flag varieties. Their torus orbits of leaves recover important families of varieties such as the open Richardson varieties.
