Using the degeneration formula and absolute/relative correspondence, one studied the change of Gromov-Witten invariants under blow-up for six dimensional symplectic manifolds and obtained closed blow-up formulae for high genus Gromov-Witten invariants. Our formulae also imply some relations among generalized BPS numbers introduced by Pandharipande.
