We prove that for any number r in [2,3], there are spin (resp. non-spin minimal) simply connected complex surfaces of general type X with c_1^2(X)/c_2(X) arbitrarily close to r. In particular, this shows the existence of simply connected surfaces of general type arbitrarily close to the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau line. In addition, we prove that for any r \in [1,3] and any integer q\geq 0, there are minimal complex surfaces of general type X with c_1^2(X)/c_2(X) arbitrarily close to r, and \pi_1(X) isomorphic to the fundamental group of a compact Riemann surface of genus q.
