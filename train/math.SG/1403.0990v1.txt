For each sphere with three orbifold points, we construct an algorithm to compute the open Gromov-Witten potential, which serves as the quantum-corrected Landau-Ginzburg mirror and is an infinite series in general. This gives the first class of general-type geometries whose full potentials can be computed. As a consequence we obtain an enumerative meaning of mirror maps for elliptic curve quotients. Furthermore, we prove that the open Gromov-Witten potential is convergent, even in the general-type cases, and has an isolated singularity at the origin, which is an important ingredient of proving homological mirror symmetry.
