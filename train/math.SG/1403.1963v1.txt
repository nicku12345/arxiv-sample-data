In this paper, we define the generalized Lejmi's P_J operator on a compact almost K\"{a}hler 2n-manifold. We get that J is C^\infty-pure and full if \dim\ker P_J=b^2-1. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between J-anti-invariant cohomology introduced by T.-J. Li and W. Zhang and new symplectic cohomologies introduced by L.-S. Tseng and S.-T. Yau on a closed symplectic 4-manifold.
