In arXiv:1308.3152, the author proved that the Khovanov-Rozansky homology \mathcal{H}_N with potential ax^{N+1} is an invariant for transverse links in the standard contact 3-sphere. In the current paper, we study the \mathbb{Z}_2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}^{\oplus 3}-graded \mathbb{Q}[a]-module structure of \mathcal{H}_N, which leads to better understanding of the effect of stabilization on \mathcal{H}_N. As an application, we compute \mathcal{H}_N for all transverse unknots.
