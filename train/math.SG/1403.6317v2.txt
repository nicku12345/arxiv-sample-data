We compare spectral invariants in periodical orbits and Lagrangian Floer homology case, for closed symplectic manifold P and its closed Lagrangian submanifolds L, when \omega|_{\pi_2(P,L)}=0, and \mu|_{\pi_2(P,L)}=0. From this result, we derive a corollary considering comparison of Hofer's distance in periodic orbits and Lagrangian case. We also define a product HF_*(H)\otimes HF_*(L,\phi^1_H(L))\to HF_*(L,\phi^1_H(L)) and prove subadditivity of invariants with respect to this product.
