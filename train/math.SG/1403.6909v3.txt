A generalized complex manifold is locally gauge-equivalent to the product of a holomorphic Poisson manifold with a real symplectic manifold, but in possibly many different ways. In this paper we show that the isomorphism class of the holomorphic Poisson structure occurring in this local model is independent of the choice of gauge equivalence, and is hence the unique local invariant of generalized complex manifolds. We use this result to prove that the complex locus of a generalized complex manifold naturally inherits the structure of a complex analytic space.
