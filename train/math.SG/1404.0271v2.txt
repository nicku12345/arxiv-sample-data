We prove two main results:   (a) Suppose L is a closed, embedded, exact special Lagrangian m-fold in {\mathbb C}^m for m\ge 3 asymptotic at infinity to the union \Pi_1\cup\Pi_2 of two transverse special Lagrangian planes \Pi_1,\Pi_2 in {\mathbb C}^m. Then L is one of the explicit 'Lawlor neck' family of examples found by Lawlor (Invent. math. 95, 1989).   (b) Suppose L is a closed, embedded, exact Lagrangian mean curvature flow expander in {\mathbb C}^m for m\ge 3 asymptotic at infinity to the union \Pi_1\cup\Pi_2 of two transverse Lagrangian planes \Pi_1,\Pi_2 in {\mathbb C}^m. Then L is one of the explicit family of examples found by Joyce, Lee and Tsui, arXiv:0801.3721.   If instead L is immersed rather than embedded, the only extra possibility in (a),(b) is L=\Pi_1\cup\Pi_2.   Our methods, which are new and can probably be used to prove other similar uniqueness theorems, involve J-holomorphic curves, Lagrangian Floer cohomology, and Fukaya categories from symplectic topology. When m=2, (a) is easy to prove using hyperkahler geometry, and (b) is proved by Lotay and Neves, arXiv:1208.2729.
