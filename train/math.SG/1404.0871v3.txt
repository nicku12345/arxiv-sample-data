We consider the Tarski--Bang problem about covering of convex bodies by planks. The results of this kind give a lower bound on the sum of widths of planks (regions between a pair of parallel hyperplanes) covering a given convex body.   Previously we have applied some notions of symplectic geometry to study convex bodies, and here we show that the symplectic techniques may be useful in this problem as well. We are able to handle some particular cases with the symplectic techniques, and show that the general cases would follow from a certain ``subadditivity conjecture'' in symplectic geometry, motivated by the results of K.~Ball. We also prove several related results by more elementary methods.
