This paper studies the action of symplectic homeomorphisms on smooth submanifolds, with a main focus on the behaviour of symplectic homeomorphisms with respect to numerical invariants like capacities. Our main result is that a symplectic homeomorphism may preserve and squeeze codimension 4 symplectic submanifolds (C^0-flexibility), while this is impossible for codimension 2 symplectic submanifolds (C^0-rigidity). We also discuss C^0-invariants of coistropic and Lagrangian submanifolds, proving some rigidity results and formulating some conjectures. We finally formulate an Eliashberg-Gromov C^0-rigidity type question for submanifolds, which we solve in many cases. Our main technical tool is a quantitative h-principle result in symplectic geometry.
