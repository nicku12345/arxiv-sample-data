Ideas of Fukaya and Kontsevich-Soibelman suggest that one can use Strominger-Yau-Zaslow's geometric approach to mirror symmetry as a torus duality to construct the mirror of a symplectic manifold equipped with a Lagrangian torus fibration as a moduli space of simple objects of the Fukaya category supported on the fibres. In the absence of singular fibres, the construction of the mirror is explained in this framework, and, given a Lagrangian submanifold, a (twisted) coherent sheaf on the mirror is constructed.
