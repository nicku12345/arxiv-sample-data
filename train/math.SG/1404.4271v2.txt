In this note we consider the following conjecture: given any closed symplectic manifold M, there is a sufficiently small real positive number \rho such that the open ball of radius \rho in the Hofer metric centered at the identity on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of M is contractible, where the retraction takes place in that ball -- this is the strong version of the conjecture -- or inside the ambient group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of M -- this is the weak version of the conjecture. We prove several results that support that weak form of the conjecture.
