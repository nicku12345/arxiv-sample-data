We use the hyperK\"aler geometry define an disc-counting invariants with deformable boundary condition on hyperK\"ahler manifolds. Unlike the reduced Gromov-Witten invariants, these invariants can have non-trivial wall-crossing phenomenon and are expected to be the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants in the construction of hyperK\"ahler metric proposed by Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke.
