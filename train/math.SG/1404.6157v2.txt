We establish a parametric extension h-principle for overtwisted contact structures on manifolds of all dimensions, which is the direct generalization of the 3-dimensional result from \cite{Eli89}. It implies, in particular, that any closed manifold admits a contact structure in any given homotopy class of almost contact structures.
