This is a survey about certain "almost homomorphisms" and "almost linear" functionals (called quasi-morphisms and quasi-states) in symplectic topology and their applications to Hamiltonian dynamics, functional-theoretic properties of Poisson brackets and algebraic and metric properties of symplectomorphism groups.
