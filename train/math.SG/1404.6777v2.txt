Relations between the symplectically harmonic cohomology and the coeffective cohomology of a symplectic manifold are obtained. This is achieved through a generalization of the latter, which in addition allows us to provide a coeffective version of the filtered cohomologies introduced by C.-J. Tsai, L.-S. Tseng and S.-T. Yau. We construct closed (simply connected) manifolds endowed with a family of symplectic forms \omega_t such that the dimensions of these symplectic cohomology groups vary with respect to t. A complete study of these cohomologies is given for 6-dimensional symplectic nilmanifolds, and concrete examples with special cohomological properties are obtained on an 8-dimensional solvmanifold and on 2-step nilmanifolds in higher dimensions.
