In this paper we consider special linear Fuchsian systems of rank 2 on a 4-punctured sphere and the corresponding parabolic structures. Through an explicit abelianization procedure we obtain a 2-to-1 correspondence between flat line bundle connections on a torus and these Fuchsian systems. This naturally equips the moduli space of flat SL(2,\mathbb C)-connections on a 4-punctured sphere with a new set of Darboux coordinates. Furthermore, we apply our theory to give a complex analytic proof of Witten's formula for the symplectic volume of the moduli space of unitary flat connections on the 4-punctured sphere.
