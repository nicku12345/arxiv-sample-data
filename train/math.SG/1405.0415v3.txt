In this paper we consider oscillating non-exact magnetic fields on surfaces with genus at least two and show that for almost every energy level k below a certain value \tau_+^*(g,\sigma) less than or equal to the "Ma\~n\'e critical value of the universal cover" there are infinitely many closed magnetic geodesics with energy k.
