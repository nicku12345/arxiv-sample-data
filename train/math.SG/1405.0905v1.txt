We construct analogues of the classical Heisenberg spin chain model (or the discrete Neumann system) on pseudo-spheres and light-like cones in the pseudo-Euclidean spaces and show their complete Hamiltonian integrability. Further, we prove that the Heisenberg model on a light--like cone leads to a new example of integrable discrete contact system.
