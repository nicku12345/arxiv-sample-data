In this paper we solve a contact non-squeezing conjecture proposed by Eliashberg, Kim and Polterovich. Let B_R be the open ball of radius R in \mathbf{R}^{2n} and let \mathbf{R}^{2n}\times\mathbf{S}^1 be the prequantization space equipped with the standard contact structure. Following Tamarkin's idea, we apply microlocal category methods to prove that if R and r satisfy 1\leq\pi r^2<\pi R^2, then it is impossible to squeeze the contact ball B_R\times\mathbf{S}^1 into B_r\times\mathbf{S}^1 via compactly supported contact isotopies.
