Goodwillie \cite{Goodwillie} introduced a periodic cyclic homology group associated to a mixed complex. In this paper, we apply this construction to the symplectic cochain complex of a Liouville domain M and obtain two periodic symplectic cohomology theories, denoted as HP^*_{S^1}(M) and HP^*_{S^1, \mathrm{loc}}(M). Our main result is that both cohomology theories are invariant under Liouville isomorphisms and there is a natural isomorphism HP^*_{S^1, \mathrm{loc}}(M, \mathbb{Q}) \cong H^*(M, \mathbb{Q})((u)), which can be seen as a localization theorem for HP^*_{S^1, \mathrm{loc}}(M, \mathbb{Q}).
