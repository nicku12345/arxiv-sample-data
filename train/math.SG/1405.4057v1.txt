Let \Sigma\subset \R^{2n} with n\geq2 be any C^2 compact convex hypersurface and only has finitely geometrically distinct closed characteristics. Based on Y.Long and C.Zhu 's index jump methods \cite{LoZ1}, we prove that there are at least two geometrically distinct elliptic closed characteristics, and moreover, there exist at least \varrho_{n} (\Sigma) (\varrho_{n}(\Sigma)\geq[\frac{n}{2}]+1) geometrically distinct closed characteristics such that for any two elements among them, the ratio of their mean indices is irrational number.
