We compute quantum cohomology ring of elliptic \mathbb{P}^1 orbifolds via orbi-curve counting. The main technique is the classification theorem which relates holomorphic orbi-curves with certain orbifold coverings. The countings of orbi-curves are related to the integer solutions of Diophantine equations. This reproduces the computation of Satake and Takahashi in the case of \mathbb{P}^1_{3,3,3} via different method.
