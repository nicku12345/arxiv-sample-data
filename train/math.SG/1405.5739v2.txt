So far, it is still unknown whether all the closed characteristics on a symmetric compact star-shaped hypersurface \Sigma in {\bf R}^{2n} are symmetric. In order to understand behaviors of such orbits, in this paper we establish first two new resonance identities for symmetric closed characteristics on symmetric compact star-shaped hypersurface \Sigma in {\bf R}^{2n} when there exist only finitely many geometrically distinct symmetric closed characteristics on \Sigma, which extend the identity established by Liu and Long in \cite{LLo1} of 2013 for symmetric strictly convex hypersurfaces. Then as an application of these identities and the identities established by Liu, Long and Wang recently in \cite{LLW1} for all closed characteristics on the same hypersurface, we prove that if there exist exactly two geometrically distinct closed characteristics on a symmetric compact star-shaped hypersuface in {\bf R}^4, then both of them must be elliptic.
