Let (X,\omega) be a compact symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian action of a compact Lie group G and \mu: X\to \mathfrak g be its moment map. In this paper, we study the L^2-moduli spaces of symplectic vortices on Riemann surfaces with cylindrical ends. We studied a circle-valued action functional whose gradient flow equation corresponds to the symplectic vortex equations on a cylinder S^1\times \mathbb R. Assume that 0 is a regular value of the moment map \mu, we show that the functional is of Bott-Morse type and its critical points of the functional form twisted sectors of the symplectic reduction (the symplecitc orbifold [\mu^{-1}(0)/G]).   We show that any gradient flow lines approaches its limit point exponentially fast. Fredholm theory and compactness property are then established for the L^2-Moduli spaces of symplectic vortices on Riemann surfaces with cylindrical ends.
