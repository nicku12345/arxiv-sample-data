We give an algorithm which produces infinitely many pairwise exotic Stein fillings of the same contact 3-manifolds, applying positive allowable Lefschetz fibrations over the disk. As a corollary, for a large class of Stein fillings, we realize the topological invariants (i.e. fundamental group, homology group, homology group of the boundary, and intersection form) of each filling as those of infinitely many pairwise exotic Stein fillings. Furthermore, applying the algorithm, we produce various contact 3-manifolds of support genus one each of which admits infinitely many pairwise exotic Stein fillings.
