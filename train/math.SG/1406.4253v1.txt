This is the second paper in a series following arXiv:1405.6352, on the construction of a mathematical theory of the gauged linear \sigma-model (GLSM). In this paper, assuming the existence of virtual moduli cycles and their certain properties, we define the correlation function of GLSM for a fixed smooth rigidified r-spin curve.
