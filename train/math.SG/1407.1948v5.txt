Let the circle act in a Hamiltonian fashion on a compact symplectic manifold (M, \omega) of dimension 2n. Then the S^1-action has at least n+1 fixed points. We study the case when the fixed point set consists of precisely n+1 isolated points. We show certain equivalence on the first Chern class of M and some particular weight of the S^1-action at some fixed point. We show that the particular weight can completely determine the integral cohomology ring of M, the total Chern class of M, and the sets of weights of the S^1-action at all the fixed points. We will see that all these data are isomorphic to those of known examples, \CP^n, or \Gt_2(\R^{n+2}) with n\geq 3 odd, equipped with standard circle actions.
