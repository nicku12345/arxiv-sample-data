We show that for dynamically convex contact forms in three dimensions, the cylindrical contact homology differential d can be defined by directly counting holomorphic cylinders for a generic almost complex structure, without any abstract perturbation of the Cauchy-Riemann equation. We also prove that d^2 = 0. Invariance of cylindrical contact homology in this case can be proved using S^1-dependent almost complex structures, similarly to work of Bourgeois-Oancea; this will be explained in another paper.
