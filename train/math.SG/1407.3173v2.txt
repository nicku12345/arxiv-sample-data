We show that, for certain families \phi_{\mathbf{s}} of diffeomorphisms of high-dimensional spheres, the commutator of the Dehn twist along the zero-section of T^*S^n with the family of pullbacks \phi^*_{\mathbf{s}} gives a noncontractible family of compactly-supported symplectomorphisms. In particular, we find examples: where the Dehn twist along a parametrised Lagrangian sphere depends up to Hamiltonian isotopy on its parametrisation; where the symplectomorphism group is not simply-connected, and where the symplectomorphism group does not have the homotopy-type of a finite CW-complex. We show that these phenomena persist for Dehn twists along the standard matching spheres of the A_m-Milnor fibre. The nontriviality is detected by considering the action of symplectomorphisms on the space of parametrised Lagrangian submanifolds. We find related examples of symplectic mapping classes for T^*(S^n\times S^1) and of an exotic symplectic structure on T^*(S^n\times S^1) standard at infinity.
