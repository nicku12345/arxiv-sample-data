We construct infinitely many families of monotone Lagrangian tori in \mathbb{R}^6, no two of which are related by Hamiltonian isotopies (or symplectomorphisms). These families are distinguished by the (arbitrarily large) numbers of families of Maslov index 2 pseudo-holomorphic discs that they bound.
