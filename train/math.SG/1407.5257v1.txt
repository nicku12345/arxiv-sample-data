In this article, using combinatorial techniques of mapping class groups, we show that a Stein fillable integral homology 3-sphere supported by an open book decomposition with page a 4-holed sphere admits a unique Stein filling up to diffeomorphism. Furthermore, according to a property of deforming symplectic fillings of a rational homology 3-spheres into strongly symplectic fillings, we also show that a symplectically fillable integral homology 3-sphere supported by an open book decomposition with page a 4-holed sphere admits a unique symplectic filling up to diffeomorphism and blow-up.
