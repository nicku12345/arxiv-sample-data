Given a compact Lagrangian submanifold L of a symplectic manifold (M,\omega), Fukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono construct a filtered A_\infty-algebra \mathcal{F}(L), on the cohomology of L, which we call the Fukaya algebra of L. In this paper we describe the Fukaya algebra of a product of two Lagrangians submanifolds L_1\times L_2. Namely, we show that \mathcal{F}(L_1\times L_2) is quasi-isomorphic to \mathcal{F}(L_1)\otimes_\infty \mathcal{F}(L_2), where \otimes_\infty is the tensor product of filtered A_\infty-algebras defined in arXiv:1404.7184. As a corollary of this quasi-isomorphism we obtain a description of the bounding cochains on \mathcal{F}(L_1\times L_2) and of the Floer cohomology of L_1\times L_2.
