A holomorphic Poisson structure induces a deformation of the complex structure as Hitchin's generalized geometry. Its associated cohomology naturally appears as the limit of a spectral sequence of a double complex. The first sheet of this spectral sequence is the Dolbeault cohomology with coefficients in the exterior algebra of the holomorphic tangent bundle. We identify various necessary conditions on compact complex manifolds on which this spectral sequence degenerates on the level of the second sheet. The manifolds to our concern include all compact complex surfaces, K\"ahler manifolds, and nilmanifolds with abelian complex structures or complex parallelizable manifolds.
