We construct an infinite order cork (W,f), which means that W is a smooth compact contractible 4-manifold with Stein structure, and f is a self diffeomorphism of the boundary of W, such that the n-fold composition maps f^{n}=f o f o... o f give rise to smoothly distinct corks (W, f^{n}) for sufficiently large values of n, as it approaches to infinity.
