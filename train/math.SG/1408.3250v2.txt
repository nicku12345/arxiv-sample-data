We perform here a (very) partial verification of the Kontsevich conjecture for the Hochschild cohomology of the Fukaya category, in the case of S^2. This is a completely geometric/analytic calculation involving the global Fukaya category constructed in part I. The calculation is on the chain level, and uses a technique coming from Hofer geometry. Instead of homological algebra we use abstract algebraic topology via the theory of Kan complexes and quasi-categories. On the way we also construct a higher dimensional version of relative Seidel morphism studied by Hu and Lalonde, compute this in a particular case and discuss an application to Hofer geometry of the space Lagrangian equators in S^2.
