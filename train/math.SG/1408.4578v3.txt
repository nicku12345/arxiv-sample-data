Consider a closed coisotropic submanifold N of a symplectic manifold (M,\omega) and a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism \phi on M. The main result of this article states that \phi has at least the cup-length of N many leafwise fixed points w.r.t. N, provided that it is the time-1-map of a global Hamiltonian flow whose restriction to N stays C^0-close to the inclusion N\to M. If (\phi,N) is suitably nondegenerate then the number of these points is bounded below by the sum of the Betti-numbers of N. The nondegeneracy condition is generically satisfied.   This appears to be the first leafwise fixed point result in which neither \phi\big|_N is assumed to be C^1-close to the inclusion N\to M, nor N to be of contact type or regular (i.e., "fibering"). It is optimal in the sense that the C^0-condition on \phi cannot be replaced by the assumption that \phi is Hofer-small.
