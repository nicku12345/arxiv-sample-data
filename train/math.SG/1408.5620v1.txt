We give two equivalent sets of invariants which classify pairs of coisotropic subspaces of a finite-dimensional symplectic vector space. We identify five elementary types of coisotropic pairs and show that any coisotropic pair decomposes in an appropriate sense as the direct sum of coisotropic pairs of elementary type.
