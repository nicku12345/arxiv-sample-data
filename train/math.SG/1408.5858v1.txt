Using contact-geometric techniques and sutured Floer homology, we present an alternate formulation of the minus and plus version of knot Floer homology. We further show how natural constructions in the realm of contact geometry give rise to much of the formal structure relating the various versions of Heegaard Floer homology. In addition, to a Legendrian or transverse knot K in a contact manifold (Y,\xi), we associate distinguished classes EHL(K) in the minus-version of knot floer homology and EHIL(K) in the plus version, which are each invariant under Legendrian or transverse isotopies of K. The distinguished class EHL is shown to agree with the Legendrian/transverse invariant defined by Lisca, Ozsvath, Stipsicz, and Szabo despite a strikingly dissimilar definition. While our definitions and constructions only involve sutured Floer homology and contact geometry, the identification of our invariants with known invariants uses bordered sutured Floer homology to make explicit computations of maps between sutured Floer homology groups.
