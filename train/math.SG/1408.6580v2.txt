Consider a Hamiltonian circle action on a closed 8-dimensional symplectic manifold M with exactly five fixed points, which is the smallest possible fixed set. In their paper, L. Godinho and S. Sabatini show that if M satisfies an extra "positivity condition" then the isotropy weights at the fixed points of M agree with those of some linear action on \mathbb{CP}^4. Therefore, the (equivariant) cohomology rings and the (equivariant) Chern classes of M and \mathbb{CP}^4 agree; in particular, H^*(M;\mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}[y]/y^5 and c(TM) = (1+y)^5. In this paper, we prove that this positivity condition always holds for these manifolds. This completes the proof of the "symplectic Petrie conjecture" for Hamiltonian circle actions on on 8-dimensional closed symplectic manifolds with minimal fixed sets.
