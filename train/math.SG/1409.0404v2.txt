Let \alpha be a contact form on a manifold M, and L\subseteq M a closed Legendrian submanifold. I prove that L intersects some characteristic for \alpha at least twice if all characteristics are closed and of the same period, and \alpha embeds nicely into the product of \mathbb{R}^{2n} and an exact symplectic manifold. As an application of the method of proof, the minimal action of a regular closed coisotropic submanifold of complex projective space is at most \pi/2. This yields an obstruction to presymplectic embeddings, and in particular to Lagrangian embeddings.
