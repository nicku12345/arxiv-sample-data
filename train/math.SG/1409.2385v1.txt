McDuff and Schlenk have recently determined exactly when a four-dimensional symplectic ellipsoid symplectically embeds into a symplectic ball. Similarly, Frenkel and M\"uller have recently determined exactly when a symplectic ellipsoid symplectically embeds into a symplectic cube. Symplectic embeddings of more complicated structures, however, remain mostly unexplored. We study when a symplectic ellipsoid E(a,b) symplectically embeds into a polydisc P(c,d). We prove that there exists a constant C depending only on d/c (here, d is assumed greater than c) such that if b/a is greater than C, then the only obstruction to symplectically embedding E(a,b) into P(c,d) is the volume obstruction. We also conjecture exactly when an ellipsoid embeds into a scaling of P(1,b) for b greater than or equal to 6, and conjecture about the set of (a,b) such that the only obstruction to embedding E(1,a) into a scaling of P(1,b) is the classical volume. Finally, we verify our conjecture for b = \frac{13}{2}.
