We say that a fixed point of a diffeomorphism is non-degenerate if 1 is not an eigenvalue of the linearization at the fixed point. We use pseudo-holomorphic curves techniques to prove the following: the inclusion map i: \text{Diff} ^{1} (S ^{2} ) \to \text{Diff} (S^2) vanishes on all homotopy groups, where \text{Diff} ^{1} (S^{2} ) \subset \text {Diff} (S^{2} ) denotes the space of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of S ^{2}  with a prescribed non-degenerate fixed point. This complements the classical results of Smale and Eels and Earl.
