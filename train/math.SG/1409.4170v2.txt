For an oriented isometric immersion f:M\to S^n the spherical Gauss map is the Legendrian immersion of its unit normal bundle UM^\perp into the unit sphere subbundle of TS^n, and the geodesic Gauss map \gamma projects this into the manifold of oriented geodesics in S^n (the Grassmannian of oriented 2-planes in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}), giving a Lagrangian immersion of UM^\perp into a Kaehler-Einstein manifold. We give expressions for the mean curvature vectors for both the spherical and geodesic Gauss maps in terms of the second fundamental form of f, and show that when f has conformal shape form this depends only on the mean curvature of f. In particular we deduce that the geodesic Gauss map of every minimal surface in S^n is minimal Lagrangian. We also give simple proofs that: deformations of f always correspond to Hamiltonian deformations of \gamma; the mean curvature vector of \gamma is always a Hamiltonian vector field. This extends work of Palmer on the case when M is a hypersurface.
