Let L be a D-dimensional submanifold of a 2D-dimensional exact symplectic manifold (M, w) and let f be a symplectic diffeomorphism onf M. In this article, we deal with the link between the dynamics of f restricted to L and the geometry of L (is L Lagrangian, is it smooth, is it a graph...?). We prove different kinds of results. - for D=3, we prove that if a torus that carries some characteristic loop, then either L is Lagrangian or the restricted dynamics g of f to L can not be minimal (i.e. all the orbits are dense) with (g^k) equilipschitz; - for a Tonelli Hamiltonian of the cotangent bundle M of the 3-dimenional torus, we give an example of an invariant submanifold L with no conjugate points that is not Lagrangian and such that for every symplectic diffeomorphism f of M, if f(L)=L, then L is not minimal; - with some hypothesis for the restricted dynamics, we prove that some invariant Lipschitz D-dimensional submanifolds of Tonelli Hamiltonian flows are in fact Lagrangian, C^1 and graphs; -we give similar results for C^1 submanifolds with weaker dynamical assumptions.
