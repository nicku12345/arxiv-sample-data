Let M be an exact symplectic manifold equal to a symplectization near infinity and having stably trivializable tangent bundle, and \phi be an exact symplectomorphism of M which, near infinity, is equal to either the identity or the symplectization of a contactomorphism \hat{\phi} such that neither \hat{\phi} nor \hat{\phi}^2 has fixed points. We give conditions under which Seidel and Smith's localization theorem for Lagrangian Floer cohomology implies the existence of a spectral sequence from \mathit{HF}(\phi^2)\otimes \mathbb Z_2((\theta)) to \mathit{HF}(\phi)\otimes \mathbb Z_2((\theta)).
