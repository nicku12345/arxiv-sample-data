'Kuranishi spaces' were introduced in the work of Fukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono in symplectic geometry (see e.g. arXiv:1106.4882), as the geometric structure on moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves. An alternative to Kuranishi spaces is the 'polyfolds' of Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder (see e.g. arXiv:1407.3185). Finding a satisfactory definition of Kuranishi space has been the subject of recent debate (see e.g. arXiv:1208.1340, arXiv:1209.4410, arXiv:1510.06849).   We propose three new definitions of Kuranishi space: a simple 'manifold' version, '\mu-Kuranishi spaces', which form an ordinary category \boldsymbol\mu\bf Kur; a more complicated 'manifold' version, 'm-Kuranishi spaces', which form a weak 2-category \bf mKur; and an 'orbifold' version, 'Kuranishi spaces', which form a weak 2-category \bf Kur. These are related by an equivalence of categories \boldsymbol\mu{\bf Kur}\simeq{\rm Ho}({\bf mKur}), where {\rm Ho}({\bf mKur}) is the homotopy category of \bf mKur, and by a full and faithful embedding {\bf mKur}\hookrightarrow\bf Kur. We also define (\mu-, m-)Kuranishi spaces with boundary, and with corners. We hope our definitions will become accepted as final, replacing previous definitions.   Any Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono Kuranishi space \bf X can be made into a compact Kuranishi space \bf X' uniquely up to equivalence in \bf Kur (that is, up to isomorphism in {\rm Ho}({\bf Kur})). The same holds for topological spaces with Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono 'good coordinate systems', and for McDuff and Wehrheim's 'Kuranishi atlases' in arXiv:1508.01556. A compact topological space \bf X with a 'polyfold Fredholm structure' in the sense of Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder can be made into a Kuranishi space \bf X uniquely up to equivalence in \bf Kur.
