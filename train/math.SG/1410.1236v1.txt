We compute the Yamabe invariant for a class of symplectic 4-manifolds of general type obtained by taking the rational blowdown of Kahler surfaces. In particular, for any point on the half-Noether line we exhibit a simply connected minimal symplectic manifold for which we compute the Yamabe invariant.
