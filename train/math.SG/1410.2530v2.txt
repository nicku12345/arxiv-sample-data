We prove that closed connected contact manifolds of dimension \geq 5 related by an h-cobordism with a flexible Weinstein structure become contactomorphic after some kind of stabilization. We also provide examples of non-conjugate contact structures on a closed manifold with exact symplectomorphic symplectizations.
