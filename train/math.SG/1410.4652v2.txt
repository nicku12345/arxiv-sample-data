We give a complete characterization of those disk bundles over surfaces which embed as rationally convex strictly pseudoconvex domains in \mathbb{C}^2. We recall some classical obstructions and prove some deeper ones related to symplectic and contact topology. We explain the close connection to Lagrangian surfaces with isolated singularities and develop techniques for constructing such surfaces. Our proof also gives a complete characterization of Lagrangian surfaces with open Whitney umbrellas, answering a question first posed by Givental in 1986.
