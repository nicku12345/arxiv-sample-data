Given a transverse knot K in a three dimensional contact manifold (Y,\alpha), in [13] Colin, Ghiggini, Honda and Hutchings define a hat version of embedded contact homology for K, that we call \widehat{ECK}(K,Y,\alpha), and conjecture that it is isomorphic to the knot Floer homology \widehat{HFK}(K,Y). We define here a full version ECK(K,Y,\alpha) and generalise the definitions to the case of links. We prove then that, if Y = S^3, ECK and \widehat{ECK} categorify the (multivariable) Alexander polynomial of knots and links, obtaining expressions analogue to that for knot and link Floer homologies in the plus and, respectively, hat versions.
