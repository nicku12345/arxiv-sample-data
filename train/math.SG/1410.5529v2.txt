In the classical Kostant-Souriau prequantization procedure, the Poisson algebra of a symplectic manifold (M,\omega) is realized as the space of infinitesimal quantomorphisms of the prequantization circle bundle. Robinson and Rawnsley developed an alternative to the Kostant-Souriau quantization process in which the prequantization circle bundle and metaplectic structure for (M,\omega) are replaced by a metaplectic-c prequantization. They proved that metaplectic-c quantization can be applied to a larger class of manifolds than the classical recipe. This paper presents a definition for a metaplectic-c quantomorphism, which is a diffeomorphism of metaplectic-c prequantizations that preserves all of their structures. Since the structure of a metaplectic-c prequantization is more complicated than that of a circle bundle, we find that the definition must include an extra condition that does not have an analogue in the Kostant-Souriau case. We then define an infinitesimal quantomorphism to be a vector field whose flow consists of metaplectic-c quantomorphisms, and prove that the space of infinitesimal metaplectic-c quantomorphisms exhibits all of the same properties that are seen for the infinitesimal quantomorphisms of a prequantization circle bundle. In particular, this space is isomorphic to the Poisson algebra C^\infty(M).
