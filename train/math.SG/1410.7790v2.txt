For a Riemannian metric g on the two-sphere, let \ell_{\min}(g) be the length of the shortest closed geodesic and \ell_{\max}(g) be the length of the longest simple closed geodesic. We prove that if the curvature of g is positive and sufficiently pinched, then the sharp systolic inequalities \[ \ell_{\rm min}(g)^2 \leq \pi \ {\rm Area}(S^2,g) \leq \ell_{\max}(g)^2, \] hold, and each of these two inequalities is an equality if and only if the metric g is Zoll. The first inequality answers positively a conjecture of Babenko and Balacheff. The proof combines arguments from Riemannian and symplectic geometry.
