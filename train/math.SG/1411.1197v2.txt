We study the symplectic nature of the moduli stack classifying dormant curves over a field K of positive characteristic, i.e., proper hyperbolic curves over K equipped with a dormant indigenous bundle. The central objects of the present paper are the following two Deligne-Mumford stacks. One is the cotangent bundle {^\circledcirc T^{\vee ^\mathrm{Zzz...}}_{g,K}} of the moduli stack {^\circledcirc \mathfrak{M}^{^\mathrm{Zzz...}}_{g,K}} classifying ordinary dormant curves over K of genus g. The other is the moduli stack {^\circledcirc \mathfrak{S}^{^\mathrm{Zzz...}}_{g,K}} classifying ordinary dormant curves over K equipped with an indigenous bundle. These Deligne-Mumford stacks admit canonical symplectic structures respectively. The main result of the present paper asserts that a canonical isomorphism {^\circledcirc T^{\vee ^\mathrm{Zzz...}}_{g,K}} \rightarrow {^\circledcirc \mathfrak{S}^{^\mathrm{Zzz...}}_{g,K}} preserves the symplectic structure. This result may be thought of as a positive characteristic analogue of the works of S. Kawai (in the paper entitled "The symplectic nature of the space of projective connections on Riemann surfaces"), P. Ar\'{e}s-Gastesi, I. Biswas, and B. Loustau. Finally, as its application, we construct a Frobenius-constant quantization on the moduli stack {^\circledcirc \mathfrak{S}^{^\mathrm{Zzz...}}_{g,K}}.
