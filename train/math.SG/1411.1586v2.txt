In this paper we compute the minimal number of Darboux chart needed to cover a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type in terms of the degree of their embeddings in \mathbb{C} P^N. The proof is based on the recent work of Y. B. Rudyak and F. Schlenk [18] and on the symplectic geometry tool developed by the first author in collaboration with A. Loi and F. Zuddas [12]. As application we compute this number for a large class of Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type.
