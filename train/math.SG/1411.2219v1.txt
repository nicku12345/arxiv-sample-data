Following a question of F. Le Roux, we consider a system of invariants l_A : H_1(M; \mathbb{Z})\to\mathbb{R} of a symplectic surface M. These invariants compute the minimal Hofer energy needed to translate a disk of area A along a given homology class and can be seen as a symplectic analogue of the Riemannian length spectrum. When M has genus zero we also construct Hofer- and C_0-continuous quasimorphisms Ham(M) \to H_1(M;\mathbb{R}) that compute trajectories of periodic non-displaceable disks.
