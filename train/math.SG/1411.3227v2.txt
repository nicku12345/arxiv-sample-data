We study the role that Hamiltonian and symplectic diffeomorphisms play in the deformation problem of coisotropic submanifolds. We prove that the action by Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms corresponds to the gauge-action of the L_\infty-algebra of Oh and Park. Moreover we introduce the notion of extended gauge-equivalence and show that in the case of Oh and Park's L_\infty-algebra one recovers the action of symplectic isotopies on coisotropic submanifolds. Finally, we consider the transversally integrable case in detail.
