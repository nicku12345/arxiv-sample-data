In this paper we show that the singular locus of a Legendrian foliation as defined in [Hua13] is a compact submanifold whose connected components are of codimension at most two. As a consequence, given any closed (n+1)-dimensional coisotropic submanifold W in a contact (2n+1)-manifold, the contact structure in a sufficiently small neighborhood of W is uniquely determined by the characteristic (Legendrian) foliation.
