Using the structural theorems developed in [Hua13], we study the deformation theory of coisotropic submanifolds in contact manifolds, under the assumption that the characteristic foliation is nonsingular. In the "middle" dimensions, we find an interesting relationship with foliation theory. Some elementary applications of contact geometry in foliation theory are explored.
