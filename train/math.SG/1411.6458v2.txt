Let (M,J) be a compact, connected, almost complex manifold of dimension 2n endowed with a J-preserving circle action with isolated fixed points. In this note we analyse the `geography problem' for such manifolds, deriving equations relating the Chern numbers to the index k_0 of (M,J). We study the symmetries and zeros of the Hilbert polynomial associated to (M,J), which imply many rigidity results for the Chern numbers when k_0\neq 1.   We apply these results to the category of compact, connected symplectic manifolds. A long-standing question posed by McDuff and Salamon, also known as the `McDuff conjecture', asked about the existence of non-Hamiltonian actions with isolated fixed points. This question was answered recently by Tolman, with an explicit construction of a six-dimensional manifold with such an action. One issue that this raises is whether one can find topological criteria that ensure the manifold can only support a Hamiltonian or only a non-Hamiltonian action. In this vein, we are able to deduce such criteria from our rigidity theorems in terms of relatively few Chern numbers, depending on the index. This improves upon results of Feldman for which one needs to know the entire Todd genus.   Another consequence of our work is that, in the situation above with a Hamiltonian action, the minimal Chern number coincides with the index and is at most n+1, mirroring results of Michelsohn in the complex category and Hattori in the almost complex category.
