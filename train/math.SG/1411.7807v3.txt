We define and investigate spectral invariants for Floer homology HF(H,U:M) of an open subset U\subset M in T^*M, defined by Kasturirangan and Oh as a direct limit of Floer homologies of approximations. We define a module structure product on HF(H,U:M) and prove the triangle inequality for invariants with respect to this product. We also prove the continuity of these invariants and compare them with spectral invariants for periodic orbits case in T^*M.
