We examine how symplectic cohomology may be used as an invariant on symplectic structures, and investigate the non-uniqueness of these structures on Liouville domains, a field which has seen much development in the past decade. Notably, we prove the existence of infinitely many non-standard symplectic structures on finite type Liouville manifolds for dimensions n\geq 6. To do this, we build up notions of Liouville domains, Lefschetz fibrations, and symplectic cohomology.
