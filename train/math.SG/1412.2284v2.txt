We show that the quantisation of a connected simply-connected Poisson-Lie group admits a left-covariant noncommutative differential structure at lowest deformation order if and only if the dual of its Lie algebra admits a pre-Lie algebra structure. As an example, we find a pre-Lie algebra structure underlying the standard 3D differential structure on \C_q[SU_2]. At the noncommutative geometry level we show that the enveloping algebra U(\cm) of a Lie algebra \cm, viewed as quantisation of \cm^*, admits a connected differential exterior algebra of classical dimension if and only if \cm admits a pre-Lie algebra. We give an example where \cm is solvable and we extend the construction to the quantisation of tangent and cotangent spaces of Poisson-Lie groups by using bicross-sum and bosonization of Lie bialgebras. As an example, we obtain natural 6D left-covariant differential structures on the bicrossproduct \C[SU_2]\lrbicross U_\lambda(su_2^*).
