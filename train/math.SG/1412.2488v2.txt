In [GMPS] we proved that the moment map image of a b-symplectic toric manifold is a convex b-polytope. In this paper we obtain convexity results for the more general case of non-toric hamiltonian torus actions on b-symplectic manifolds. The modular weights of the action on the connected components of the exceptional hypersurface play a fundamental role: either they are all zero and the moment map behaves as in classic symplectic one, or they are all nonzero and the moment map behaves as in the toric b-symplectic case studied in [GMPS].
