In this paper, we examine mapping class group relations of some symplectic manifolds. For each n\geq 1 and k \geq 1, we show that the 2n-dimensional Weinstein domain W = \{f=\delta\} \cap B^{2n+2}, determined by the degree k homogeneous polynomial f\in \mathbb{C}[z_0,\dots,z_n], has a Boothby-Wang type boundary and a right-handed fibered Dehn twist along the boundary that is symplectically isotopic to a product of right-handed Dehn twists along Lagrangian spheres. We also present explicit descriptions of the symplectomorphisms in the case n=2 recovering the classical chain relation for the torus with two boundary components.
