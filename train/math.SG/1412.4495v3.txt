We show that the union of a meridian and a longitude of the symplectic 2-torus is superheavy in the sense of Entov-Polterovich. By a result of Entov-Polterovich, this implies that the product of this union and the Clifford torus of \mathbb{C}P^n with the Fubini-Study symplectic form cannot be displaced by symplectomorphisms.
