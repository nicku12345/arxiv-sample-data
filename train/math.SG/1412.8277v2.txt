We find robust obstructions to representing a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism as a full k-th power, k \geq 2, and in particular, to including it into a one-parameter subgroup. The robustness is understood in the sense of Hofer's metric. Our approach is based on the theory of persistence modules applied in the context of filtered Floer homology. We present applications to geometry and dynamics of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms.
