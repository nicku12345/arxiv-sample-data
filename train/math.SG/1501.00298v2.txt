For generic r=(r_1,\ldots,r_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n_+ the space \mathcal{M}(r) of n--gons in \mathbb{R}^3 with edges of lengths r is a smooth, symplectic manifold. We investigate its Gromov width and prove that the expression 2\pi \min \{2 r_j, (\sum_{i \neq j} r_i) - r_j\,\,|\, j=1,\ldots,n\} is the Gromov width of all (smooth) 5--gon spaces and of 6--gon spaces, under some condition on r \in \mathbb{R}^6_+. The same formula constitutes a lower bound for all (smooth) spaces of 6--gons. Moreover, we prove that the Gromov width of \mathcal{M}(r) is given by the above expression when \mathcal{M}(r) is symplectomorphic to \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^{n-3}, for any n \geq 4.
