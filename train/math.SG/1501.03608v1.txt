We construct a family of uncountably many Lagrangian submanifolds in the standard bidisks such that the Lagrangian Hofer diameter associated to each Lagrangian submanifold is unbounded. We also prove a certain inequality of the Lagrangian Hofer metric which is of the same type as S. Seyfaddini's for the case of the real form of the complex n-ball.
