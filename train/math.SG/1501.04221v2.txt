We show that isolated surface singularities which are non-normal may have Milnor fibers which are non-diffeomorphic to those of their normalizations. Therefore, non-normal isolated singularities enrich the collection of Stein fillings of links of normal isolated singularities. We conclude with a list of open questions related to this theme.
