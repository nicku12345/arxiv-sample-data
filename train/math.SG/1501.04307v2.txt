The main purpose of this paper is to propose a scheme of a proof of the nonsimpleness of the group Homeo^\Omega(D^2,\partial D^2) of area preserving homeomorphisms of the 2-disc D^2. We first establish the existence of Alexander isotopy in the category of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms. This reduces the question of extendability of the well-known Calabi homomorphism {\rm Cal}:Diff^\Omega(D^1,\partial D^2) \to \mathbb R to a homomorphism \overline{{\rm Cal}}:Hameo(D^2,\partial D^2) \to \mathbb R to that of the vanishing of the basic phase function f_{\underline{\mathbb F}}, a Floer theoretic graph selector previously constructed by the author, that is associated to the graph of the topological Hamiltonian loop and its normalized Hamiltonian \underline{F} on S^2 that is obtained via the natural embedding D^2 \hookrightarrow S^2. Here Hameo(D^2,\partial D^2) is the group of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms introduced by M\"uller and the author. We then provide an evidence of this vanishing conjecture by proving the conjecture for the special class of \emph{weakly graphical} topological Hamiltonian loops on D^2 via a study of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
