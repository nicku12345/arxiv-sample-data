In this paper we prove that a dynamically convex starshaped hypersurface in \mathbb{C}^2 which is invariant under complex conjugation admits a global surface of section which is invariant under conjugation as well. We obtain this invariant global surface by embedding \mathbb{C}^2 into \mathbb{CP}^2 and applying a stretching argument to real holomorphic curves in \mathbb{CP}^2. The motivation for this result arises from recent progress in applying holomorphic curve techniques to gain a deeper understanding on the dynamics of the restricted three body problem.
