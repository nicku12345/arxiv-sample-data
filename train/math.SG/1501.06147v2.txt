According to Lerman, compact connected toric contact 3-manifolds with a non-free toric action whose moment cone spans an angle greater than \pi are overtwisted, thus non-fillable. In contrast, we show that all compact connected toric contact manifolds in dimension greater than three are weakly symplectically fillable and most of them are strongly symplectically fillable. The proof is based on the Lerman's classification of toric contact manifolds and on our observation that the only contact manifolds in higher dimensions that admit free toric action are the cosphere bundle of T^d, d\geq3 (T^d\times S^{d-1}) and T^2\times L_k, k\in\mathbb{N}, with the unique contact structure.
