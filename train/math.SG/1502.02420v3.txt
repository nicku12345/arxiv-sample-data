For any symplectic form \omega on T^2\times S^2 we construct infinitely many nonisomorphic finite groups which admit effective smooth actions on T^2\times S^2 that are trivial in cohomology but which do not admit any effective symplectic action on (T^2\times S^2,\omega). We also prove that for any \omega there is another symplectic form \omega' on T^2\times S^2 and a finite group acting symplectically and effectively on (T^2\times S^2,\omega') which does not admit any effective symplectic action on (T^2\times S^2,\omega).   A basic ingredient in our arguments is the study of the Jordan property of the symplectomorphism groups of T^2\times S^2. A group G is Jordan if there exists a constant C such that any finite subgroup \Gamma of G contains an abelian subgroup whose index in \Gamma is at most C. Csik\'os, Pyber and Szab\'o proved recently that the diffeomorphism group of T^2\times S^2 is not Jordan. We prove that, in contrast, for any symplectic form \omega on T^2\times S^2 the group of symplectomorphisms Symp(T^2\times S^2,\omega) is Jordan. We also give upper and lower bounds for the optimal value of the constant C in Jordan's property for Symp(T^2\times S^2,\omega) depending on the cohomology class represented by \omega. Our bounds are sharp for a large class of symplectic forms on T^2\times S^2.
