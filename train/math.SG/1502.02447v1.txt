In this paper, we prove the existence of certain symplectic conifold transitions on all CP^{1}-bundles over symplectic 4--manifolds, which generalizes Smith, Thomas and Yau's examples of symplectic conifold transitions on trivial CP^{1}-bundles over K\"ahler surfaces. Our main result is to determine the diffeomorphism types of such symplectic conifold transitions of CP^{1}-bundles. In particular, this implies that in the case of trivial CP^{1}-bundles over projective surfaces, Smith, Thomas and Yau's examples of symplectic conifold transitions are diffeomorphic to K\"ahler 3--folds.
