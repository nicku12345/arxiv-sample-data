We consider a fixed contact 3-manifold that admits infinitely many compact Stein fillings which are all homeomorphic but pairwise non-diffeomorphic. Each of these fillings gives rise to a closed contact 5-manifold described as a contact open book whose page is the filling at hand and whose monodromy is the identity symplectomorphism. We show that the resulting infinitely many contact 5-manifolds are all diffeomorphic but pairwise non-contactomorphic. Moreover, we explicitly determine these contact 5-manifolds.
