This paper consists of two parts. In the first part, we use symplectic homology to distinguish the contact structures on the Brieskorn manifolds \Sigma(2l,2,2,2), which contact homology cannot distinguish. This answers a question from [22].   In the second part, we prove the existence of infinitely many exotic but homotopically trivial exotic contact structures on S^7, distinguished by the mean Euler characteristic of S^1-equivariant symplectic homology. Apart from various connected sum constructions, these contact structures can be taken from the Brieskorn manifolds \Sigma(78k+1,13,6,3,3). We end with some considerations about extending this result to higher dimensions.
