In this paper, we explore the theme of orbifold stratified spaces and establish a general criterion for them to be smooth orbifolds. This criterion utilizes the notion of linear stratification on the gluing bundles for the orbifold stratified spaces. We introduce a concept of good gluing structure to ensure a smooth structure on the stratified space. As an application, we provide an orbifold structure on the coarse moduli space \bar{M}_{g, n} of stable genus g curves with n-marked points.   Using the gluing theory for \bar{M}_{g, n}  associated to horocycle structures, there is a natural orbifold gluing atlas on \bar{M}_{g, n} . We show this gluing atlas can be refined to provide a good orbifold gluing structure and hence a smooth orbifold structure on \bar{M}_{g,n}. This general gluing principle will be very useful in the study of the gluing theory for the compactified moduli spaces of stable pseudo-holomorphic curves in a symplectic manifold.
