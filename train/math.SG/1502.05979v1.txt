This sketch shows that the usual generating function based capacities have an interpretation in the language of persistent homology as persistences of certain homology classes in the persistence module formed by the corresponding generating function homology groups. This viewpoint suggests various new invariants, in particular a \mathbb{Z}_k-equivariant capacity which can be used to prove orderability of lens spaces, proved by Milin (2008) using contact homology and by Sandon (2010) using equivariant generating function homology. These are informal notes originally circulated in January 2014.
