We construct a contact 5-manifold supported by infinitely many distinct open books with the identity monodromy and pairwise exotic Stein pages (i.e. pages are pairwise homeomorphic but non-diffeomorphic Stein fillings of a fixed contact 3-manifold), moreover we describe a process of generating infinitely many such examples. In contrast to this result, on each of \#_{n} S^{2}\times S^{3} and \#_{n} S^{2}\tilde{\times} S^{3} (n\geq 2) we construct infinitely many open books with pairwise exotic Stein pages (and identity monodromy) supporting mutually distinct contact structures.
