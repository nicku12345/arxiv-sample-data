We study symplectic invariants of the open symplectic manifolds X_\Gamma obtained by plumbing cotangent bundles of 2-spheres according to a plumbing tree \Gamma. For any tree \Gamma, we calculate (DG-)algebra models of the Fukaya category \mathcal{F}(X_\Gamma) of closed exact Lagrangians in X_\Gamma and the wrapped Fukaya category \mathcal{W}(X_\Gamma). When \Gamma is a Dynkin tree of type A_n or D_n (and conjecturally also for E_6,E_7,E_8), we prove that these models for the Fukaya category \mathcal{F}(X_\Gamma) and \mathcal{W}(X_\Gamma) are related by (derived) Koszul duality. As an application, we give explicit computations of symplectic cohomology of X_\Gamma for \Gamma=A_n,D_n, based on the Legendrian surgery formula of Bourgeois, Ekholm and Eliashberg.
