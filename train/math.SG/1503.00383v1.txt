By a Liouville structure on a symplectic manifold (M, \omega) we mean a choice of symplectic potential: that is, a choice of one-form \theta on M such that {\rm d} \theta = \omega. We determine precisely all the automorphisms of a Liouville structure in case (M, \omega) is a symplectic vector space and \theta differs from its canonical symplectic potential by the differential of a homogeneous monomial.
