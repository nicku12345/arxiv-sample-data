We adapt classical Reidemeister torsion to monotone Lagrangian submanifolds using the pearl complex of Biran and Cornea. The definition involves generic choices of data and we identify a class of Lagrangians for which this torsion is invariant and can be computed in terms of genus zero open Gromov-Witten invariants. This class is defined by a vanishing property of a spectral sequence of Oh in Lagrangian Floer theory.
