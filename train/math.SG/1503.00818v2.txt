We study Legendrian singular links up to contact isotopy. Using a special property of the singular points, we define the singular connected sum of Legendrian singular links. This concept is a generalization of the connected sum and can be interpreted as a tangle replacement, which provides a way to classify Legendrian singular links. Moreover, we investigate several phenomena only occur in the Legendrian setup.
