We identify a certain universal Landau-Ginzburg model as a mirror of the big equivariant quantum cohomology of a (not necessarily compact or semipositive) toric manifold. The mirror map and the primitive form are constructed via Seidel elements and shift operators for equivariant quantum cohomology. Primitive forms in non-equivariant theory are identified up to automorphisms of the mirror.
