We use Lagrangian torus fibrations on the mirror X of a toric Calabi-Yau threefold \check X to construct Lagrangian sections and various Lagrangian spheres on X. We then propose an explicit correspondence between the sections and line bundles on \check X and between spheres and sheaves supported on the toric divisors of \check X. We conjecture that these correspondences induce an embedding of the relevant derived Fukaya category of X inside the derived category of coherent sheaves on \check X.
