We prove that the punctured generalized conifolds and punctured orbifolded conifolds are mirror symmetric under the SYZ program with quantum corrections. This mathematically confirms the gauge-theoretic prediction by Aganagic-Karch-L\"ust-Miemiec, and also provides a supportive evidence to Morrison's conjecture that geometric transitions are reversed under mirror symmetry.
