Let M be a symplectic toric manifold acted on by a torus \mathbb{T}. In this work we exhibit an explicit basis for the equivariant K-theory ring \mathcal{K}_{\mathbb{T}}(M) which is canonically associated to a generic component of the moment map. We provide a combinatorial algorithm for computing the restrictions of the elements of this basis to the fixed point set; these, in turn, determine the ring structure of \mathcal{K}_{\mathbb{T}}(M). The construction is based on the notion of local index at a fixed point, similar to that introduced by Guillemin and Kogan in [GK].   We apply the same techniques to exhibit an explicit basis for the equivariant cohomology ring H_{\mathbb{T}}(M; \mathbb{Z}) which is canonically associated to a generic component of the moment map. Moreover we prove that the elements of this basis coincide with some well-known sets of classes: the equivariant Poincar\'e duals to the closures of unstable manifolds, and also the canonical classes introduced by Goldin and Tolman in [GT], which exist whenever the moment map is index increasing.
