We use quilted Floer theory to construct functor-valued invariants of tangles arising from moduli spaces of flat bundles on punctured surfaces. As an application, we show the non-triviality of certain elements in the symplectic mapping class groups of moduli spaces of flat bundles on punctured spheres.
