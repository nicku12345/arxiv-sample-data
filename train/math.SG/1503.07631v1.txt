This is the first part of the article we promised at the end of [FOOO13, Section 1]. We discuss the foundation of the virtual fundamental chain and cycle technique, especially its version appeared in [FOn] and also in [FOOO4, Section A1, Section 7.5], [FOOO7, Section 12], [Fu2]. In Part 1, we focus on the construction of the virtual fundamental chain on a single space with Kuranishi structure. We mainly discuss the de Rham version and so work over \mathbb R-coefficients, but we also include a self-contained account of the way how to work over \mathbb Q-coefficients in case the dimension of the space with Kuranishi structure is \le 1.   Part 1 of this document is independent of our earlier writing [FOOO13]. We also do not assume the reader have any knowledge on the pseudo-holomorphic curve, in Part 1.   Part 2 (resp. Part 3), which will appear in the near future, discusses the case of a system of Kuranishi structures and its simultaneous perturbations (resp. the way to implement the abstract story in the study of moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic curves).
