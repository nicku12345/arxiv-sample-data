We construct orientations on moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic quilts with seam conditions in Lagrangian correspondences equipped with relative spin structures and determine the effect of various gluing operations on the orientations. We also investigate the behavior of the orientations under composition of Lagrangian correspondences.
