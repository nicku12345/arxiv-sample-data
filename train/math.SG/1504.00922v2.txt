Given a symplectic manifold (M^{2n},\omega) we study Lagrangian cobordisms V\subset E where E is the total space of a Lefschetz fibration having M as generic fiber. We prove a generation result for these cobordisms in the appropriate derived Fukaya category. As a corollary, we analyze the relations among the Lagrangian submanifolds L\subset M that are induced by these cobordisms. This leads to a unified treatment - and a generalization - of the two types of relations among Lagrangian submanifolds of M that were previously identified in the literature: those associated to Dehn twists that were discovered by Seidel and the relations induced by cobordisms in trivial symplectic fibrations described in our previous work.
