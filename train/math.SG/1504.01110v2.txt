Let K be a connected compact semisimple group and V_\lambda be an irreducible unitary representation with highest weight \lambda. We study the momentum map \mu:\mathbb P(V_\lambda)\to\mathfrak k^*. The intersection \mu(\mathbb P(V_\lambda))^+=\mu(\mathbb P(V_\lambda))\cap{\mathfrak t}^+ of the momentum image with a fixed Weyl chamber is a convex polytope called the momentum polytope of V_\lambda. We construct an affine rational polyhedral convex cone \Upsilon_\lambda with vertex \lambda, such that \mu(\mathbb P(V_\lambda))^+\subset\Upsilon_\lambda \cap {\mathfrak t}^+. We show that equality holds for a class of representations, including those with regular highest weight. For those cases, we obtain a complete combinatorial description of the momentum polytope, in terms of \lambda. We also present some results on the critical points of ||\mu||^2. Namely, we consider the existence problem for critical points in the preimages of Kirwan's candidates for critical values. Also, we consider the secant varieties to the unique complex orbit \mathbb X\subset\mathbb P(V_\lambda), and prove a relation between the momentum images of the secant varieties and the degrees of K-invariant polynomials on V_\lambda.
