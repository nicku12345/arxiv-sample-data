Given a monotone Lagrangian submanifold invariant under a loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, we compute a piece of the closed-open string map into the Hochschild cohomology of the Lagrangian which captures the homology class of the loop's orbit.   Our applications include split-generation and non-formality results for real Lagrangians in projective spaces and other toric varieties; a particularly basic example is that the equatorial circle on the 2-sphere carries a non-formal Fukaya A-infinity algebra in characteristic two.
