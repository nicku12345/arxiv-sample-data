We show that a Lagrangian inclusion in \mathbb C^2 with double transverse self-intersection points and standard open Whitney umbrellas is rationally convex. As an application we show that any compact surface S, except S^2 and \mathbb RP_2, admits a pair of smooth complex-valued functions f_1, f_2 with the property that any continuous complex valued function on S is a uniform limit of a sequence of R_j(f_1,f_2), where R_j(z_1,z_2) are rational functions in \mathbb C^2.
