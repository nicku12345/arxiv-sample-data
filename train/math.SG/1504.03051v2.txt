In this article, we characterize isomorphism classes of Lefschetz fibrations with multisections via their monodromy factorizations. We prove that two Lefschetz fibrations with multisections are isomorphic if and only if their monodromy factorizations in the relevant mapping class groups are related to each other by a finite collection of modifications, which extend the well-known Hurwitz equivalence. This in particular characterizes isomorphism classes of Lefschetz pencils. We then show that, from simple relations in the mapping class groups, one can derive new (and old) examples of Lefschetz fibrations which cannot be written as fiber sums of blown-up pencils.
