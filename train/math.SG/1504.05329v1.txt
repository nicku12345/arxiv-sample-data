Let K denote a knot inside the homology sphere Y. The zero-framed longitude of K gives the complement of K in Y the structure of a bordered three-manifold, which may be denoted by Y(K). We compute the quasi-isomorphism type of the bordered Floer complex of Y(K) in terms of the knot Floer complex associated with K. As a corollary, we show that if a homology sphere has the same Heegaard Floer homology as S^3 it does not contain any incompressible tori. Consequently, if Y is an irreducible homology sphere L-space then Y is either S^3, or the Poicar\'e sphere \Sigma(2,3,5), or it is hyperbolic.
