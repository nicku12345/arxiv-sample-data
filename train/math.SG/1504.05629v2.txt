We give a classification of generic coadjoint orbits for the groups of symplectomorphisms and Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic surface. We also classify simple Morse functions on symplectic surfaces with respect to actions of those groups. This gives an answer to V.Arnold's problem on describing all invariants of generic isovorticed fields for the 2D ideal fluids. For this we introduce a notion of anti-derivatives on a measured Reeb graph and describe their properties.
