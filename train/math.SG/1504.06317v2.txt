We consider a version of the relative Fukaya category for anticanonical Lefschetz pencils. There are direct connections between the behaviour of this category and enumerative geometry: some of these are results announced here, others remain conjectural. The ultimate aim of this approach is to determine the Fukaya category of the Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces that constitute the pencil.
