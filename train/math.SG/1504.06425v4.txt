We observe that, in dimension four, symplectic forms may be obtained via Lorentzian geometry; in particular, null vector fields can give rise to exact symplectic forms. That a null vector field is nowhere vanishing yet orthogonal to itself is essential to this construction. Specifically, we show that on a Lorentzian 4-manifold (M,g), if {\boldsymbol k} is a complete null vector field with geodesic flow along which \text{Ric}({\boldsymbol k},{\boldsymbol k}) > 0, and if f is any smooth function on M with {\boldsymbol k}(f) nowhere vanishing, then dg(e^f{\boldsymbol k},\cdot) is a symplectic form and {\boldsymbol k}/{\boldsymbol k}(f) is a Liouville vector field; any null surface to which {\boldsymbol k} is tangent is then a Lagrangian submanifold. Even if the Ricci curvature condition is not satisfied, one can still construct such symplectic forms with additional information from {\boldsymbol k}; we give an example of this, with {\boldsymbol k} a complete Liouville vector field, on the maximally extended "rapidly rotating" Kerr spacetime.
