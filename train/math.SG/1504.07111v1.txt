In this paper, using pseudo-holomorphic curve method, one proves the Weinstein conjecture in the product P_1\times P_2 of two strongly geometrically bounded symplectic manifolds under some conditions with P_1. In particular, if N is a closed manifold or a noncompact manifold of finite topological type, our result implies that the Weinstein conjecture in \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2\times T^*N holds.
