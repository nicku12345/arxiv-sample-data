The first result of this paper is that every contact form on \mathbb{R} P^3 sufficiently C^\infty-close to a dynamically convex contact form admits an elliptic-parabolic closed Reeb orbit which is 2-unknotted, has self-linking number -1/2 and transverse rotation number in (1/2,1]. Our second result implies that any p-unknotted periodic orbit with self-linking number -1/p of a dynamically convex Reeb flow on a lens space of order p is the binding of a rational open book decomposition, whose pages are global surfaces of section.   As an application we show that in the planar circular restricted three-body problem for energies below the first Lagrange value and large mass ratio, there is a special link consisting of two periodic trajectories for the massless satellite near the smaller primary -- lunar problem -- with the same contact-topological and dynamical properties of the orbits found by Conley in~\cite{conley} for large negative energies. Both periodic trajectories bind rational open book decompositions with disk-like pages which are global surfaces of section. In particular, one of the components is an elliptic-parabolic periodic orbit.
