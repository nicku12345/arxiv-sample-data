We introduce the notion of tropicalization for Poisson structures on \mathbb{R}^n with coefficients in Laurent polynomials. To such a Poisson structure we associate a polyhedral cone and a constant Poisson bracket on this cone. There is a version of this formalism applicable to \mathbb{C}^n viewed as a real Poisson manifold. In this case, the tropicalization gives rise to a completely integrable system with action variables taking values in a polyhedral cone and angle variables spanning a torus. As an example, we consider the canonical Poisson bracket on the dual Poisson-Lie group G^* for G=U(n) in the cluster coordinates of Fomin-Zelevinsky defined by a certain choice of solid minors. We prove that the corresponding integrable system is isomorphic to the Gelfand-Zeitlin completely integrable system of Guillemin-Sternberg and Flaschka-Ratiu.
