We describe a method for solving the Maurer-Cartan structure equation associated with a Lie algebra that isolates the role of the Jacobi identity as an obstruction to integration. We show that the method naturally adapts to two other interesting situations: local symplectic realizations of Poisson structures, in which case our method sheds light on the role of the Poisson condition as an obstruction to realization; and the Maurer-Cartan structure equation associated with a Lie algebroid, in which case we obtain an explicit formula for a solution to the equation which generalizes the well known formula in the case of Lie algebras.
