We abstract Morimoto's construction of complex structures on product manifolds to pairs of certain generalized F-structures on manifolds that are not necessarily global products. As applications we characterize invariant generalized complex structures on product manifolds in which one factor is a Lie group and we generalize a theorem of Blair, Ludden and Yano on Hermitian bicontact manifolds.
