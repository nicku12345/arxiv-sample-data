We propose and prove a mirror theorem for the elliptic quasimap invariants for smooth Calabi-Yau complete intersections in projective spaces. The theorem combined with the wall-crossing formula appeared in paper (arXiv:1308.6377) implies mirror theorems of Zinger and Popa for the elliptic Gromov-Witten invariants for those varieties. This paper and the wall-crossing formula provide a unified framework for the mirror theory of rational and elliptic Gromov-Witten invariants.
