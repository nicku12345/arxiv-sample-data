This note revisits the ideas in an earlier (2007) paper on orbifolds and branched manifolds, showing how the constructions can be simplified by using a version of the Kuranishi atlases recently developed by McDuff--Wehrheim. We first show that every orbifold has such an atlas, and then use it to obtain explicit models first for the nonsingular resolution of an oriented orbifold (which is a weighted nonsingular groupoid with the same fundamental class) and second for the Euler class of an oriented orbibundle. In this approach, instead of appearing as the zero set of a multivalued section, the Euler class is the zero set of a single-valued section of the pullback bundle over the resolution, and hence has the structure of a weighted branched manifold in which the weights and branching are canonically defined by the atlas.
