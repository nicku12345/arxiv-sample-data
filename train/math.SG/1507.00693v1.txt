These are notes about the connection between the Gibbons-Hermsen system and the multi-component KP hierarchy: they were intended as a first sketch of a paper on that subject, but since it seems unlikely that I will ever write such a paper I have decided to make them available in their present form. The notes were compiled in 2009, and have not been revised since then.
