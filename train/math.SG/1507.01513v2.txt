This paper presents an algorithm to deform any Legendrian singularity to a nearby Legendrian subvariety with singularities of a simple combinatorial nature. Furthermore, the category of microlocal sheaves on the original Legendrian singularity is equivalent to that on the nearby Legendrian subvariety. This yields a concrete combinatorial model for microlocal sheaves, as well as an elementary method for calculating them.
