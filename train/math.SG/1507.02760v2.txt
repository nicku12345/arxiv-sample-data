Calculating the spectral invariant of Floer homology of the distance function, we can find some kind of superheavy subsets in symplectic manifolds. We show if convex open subsets in Euclidian space with the standard symplectic form are disjointly embedded in a spherically negative monotone closed symplectic manifold, their compliment is superheavy. In particular, the S^1 bouquet in a closed Riemann surface with genus g\geq 1 is superheavy. We also prove some analogous properties of a monotone closed symplectic manifold. These can be used to extend Seyfaddni's result about lower bounds of Poisson bracket invariant.
