By applying the lantern relation substitutions to the positive relation of the genus two Lefschetz fibration over \mathbb{S}^{2}. We show that K3\#2 \overline{\mathbb{CP}}{}^{2} can be rationally blown down along seven disjoint copies of the configuration C_2. We compute the Seiberg-Witten invariant of the resulting symplectic 4-manifolds, and show that they are symplectically minimal. We also investigate how these exotic smooth 4-manifolds constructed via lantern relation substitution method are fiber sum decomposable. Furthermore by considering all the possible decompositions for each of our decomposable exotic examples, we will find out that there is a uniquely decomposing genus 2 Lefschetz fibration which is not a self sum of the same fibration up to diffeomorphism on the indecomposable summands.
