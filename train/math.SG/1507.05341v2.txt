We show that there exist non-exact magnetic flows on the two-sphere having an energy level whose double cover is strictly contactomorphic to an irrational ellipsoid in \mathbb C^2. Our construction generalizes the examples of integrable Finsler metrics on the two-sphere with only two closed geodesics due to A. Katok.
