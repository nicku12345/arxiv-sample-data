Let (M,g) be a closed Riemannian manifold, L: TM\rightarrow \mathbb R be a Tonelli Lagrangian. Given two closed submanifolds Q_0 and Q_1 of M and a real number k, we study the existence of Euler-Lagrange orbits with energy k connecting Q_0 to Q_1 and satisfying the conormal boundary conditions. We introduce the Ma\~n\'e critical value which is relevant for this problem and discuss existence results for supercritical and subcritical energies. We also provide counterexamples showing that all the results are sharp.
