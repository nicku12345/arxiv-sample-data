We give a combinatorial way to locate non-displaceable Lagrangian toric fibers on compact toric manifolds. By taking the intersection of certain tropicalizations coming from combinatorial data of a moment polytope, we locate all strongly bulk-balanced fibers introduced in [FOOOSurv]. As an application, we show that every bulk-balanced fiber defined in [FOOOToric2] is strongly bulk-balanced. Thus, the method indeed detects the positions of all non-displaceable fibers that can be detected by Lagrangian Floer theory developed in [FOOOToric1] and [FOOOToric2].
