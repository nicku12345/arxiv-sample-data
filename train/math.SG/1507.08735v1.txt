The aim of this paper is to apply ideas from the study of Legendrian singularities to a specific example of interest within mirror symmetry. We calculate the Landau-Ginzburg A-model with M= \mathbb C^3, W=z_1 z_2 z_3 in its guise as microlocal sheaves along the natural singular Lagrangian thimble L = {\mathit Cone}(T^2)\subset M. The description we obtain is immediately equivalent to the B-model of the pair-of-pants \mathbb P^1 \setminus \{0, 1, \infty\} as predicted by mirror symmetry.
