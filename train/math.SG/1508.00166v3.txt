We study periodic orbits on a nondegenerate dynamically convex starshaped hypersurface in \mathbb{R}^{2n} along the lines of Long and Zhu, but using properties of the S^1-equivariant symplectic homology. We prove that there exist at least n distinct simple periodic orbits on any nondegenerate starshaped hypersurface in \mathbb{R}^{2n} satisfying the condition that the minimal Conley-Zehnder index is at least n-1. The condition is weaker than dynamical convexity.
