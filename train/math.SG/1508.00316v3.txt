Let X be an n-dimensional smooth complex projective variety embedded in \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^{N}. We construct a smooth family \mathcal{X} over \mathbb{C} with an embedding in \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^{N} \times \mathbb{C} whose generic fiber is X and the special fiber is the torus (\mathbb{C}^*)^n sitting in \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^{N} via a monomial embedding. We use this to show that if \omega is an integral K\"ahler form on X then for any \epsilon > 0 there is an open subset U_\epsilon \subset X such that vol(X \setminus U_\epsilon) < \epsilon and U_\epsilon is symplectomorphic to (\mathbb{C}^*)^n equipped with a (rational) toric K\"ahler form. As an application we obtain lower bounds for the Gromov width of (X, \omega) in terms of its associated Newton-Okounkov bodies. We also show that if \omega lies in the class c_1(L) of a very ample line bundle L then (X, \omega) has a full symplectic packing with d equal balls where d is the degree of (X, L).
