We investigate the line between tight and overtwisted for surgeries on fibred transverse knots in contact 3-manifolds. When the contact structure \xi_K is supported by the fibred knot K \subset M, we obtain a characterisation of when negative surgeries result in a contact structure with non-vanishing Heegaard Floer contact class. To do this, we leverage information about the contact structure \xi_{\overline{K}} supported by the mirror knot \overline{K} \subset -M. We derive several corollaries about the existence of tight contact structures, L-space knots outside S^3, non-planar contact structures, and non-planar Legendrian knots.
