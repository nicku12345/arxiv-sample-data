Let X be a Fano threefold and \C ^* \times X\rightarrow X an algebraic action. Then X has a S^1-invariant K\"ahler structure and the corresponding S^1-action admits an equivariant moment map which is at the same time a perfect Bott-Morse function. We will initiate a program to classify the Fano threefolds with semi-free {\mathbb C}^*-actions using Morse theory and the holomorphic Lefschetz fixed point formula as the main tools. In this paper we give a complete list of all possible Fano threefolds without "interior isolated fixed points" for any semi-free {\mathbb C}^*-action. For the actions whose fixed point sets have only two connected components, and in a few other cases, we give the realizations of the semi-free \C^*-actions.
