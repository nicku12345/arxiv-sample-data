For a 4-manifold represented by a framed knot in S^3, it has been well known that the 4-manifold admits a Stein structure if the framing is less than the maximal Thurston-Bennequin number of the knot. In this paper, we prove either the converse of this fact is false or there exists a compact contractible oriented smooth 4-manifold (with Stein fillable boundary) admitting no Stein structure. Note that an exotic smooth structure on S^4 exists if and only if there exists a compact contractible oriented smooth 4-manifold with S^3 boundary admitting no Stein structure.
