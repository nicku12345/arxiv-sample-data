We show that blow-ups or reverse flips (in the sense of the minimal model program) of rational symplectic manifolds with point centers create Floer-non-trivial Lagrangian tori. As applications, we demonstrate the existence of Hamiltonian non-displaceable Lagrangian tori in, for example, small symplectic blow-ups of compact symplectic manifolds and moduli spaces of polygons. These results are part of a conjectural description of generators for the Fukaya category of a compact symplectic manifold with a singularity-free running of the minimal model program.
