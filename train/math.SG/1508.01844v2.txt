Kuranishi structures were introduced in the 1990s by Fukaya and Ono for the purpose of assigning a virtual cycle to moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves that cannot be regularized by geometric methods. Starting from the same core idea (patching local finite dimensional reductions) we develop a theory of topological Kuranishi atlases and cobordisms that transparently resolves algebraic and topological challenges in this virtual regularization approach. It applies to any Kuranishi-type setting, e.g. atlases with isotropy, boundary and corners, or lack of differentiable structure.
