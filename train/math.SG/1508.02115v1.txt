Let M be an exact symplectic manifold with c_1(M)=0. Denote by \mathrm{Fuk}(M) the Fukaya category of M. We show that the dual space of the bar construction of \mathrm{Fuk}(M) has a differential graded noncommutative Poisson structure. As a corollary we get a Lie algebra structure on the cyclic cohomology \mathrm{HC}^\bullet(\mathrm{Fuk}(M)), which is analogous to the ones discovered by Kontsevich in noncommutative symplectic geometry and by Chas and Sullivan in string topology.
