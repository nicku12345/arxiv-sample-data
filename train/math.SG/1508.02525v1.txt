Following [Fra08, AF14] we construct Rabinowitz Floer homology for negative line bundles over symplectic manifolds and prove a vanishing result.   In [Rit14] Ritter showed that symplectic homology of these spaces does not vanish, in general. Thus, the theorem \mathrm{SH}=0\Leftrightarrow\mathrm{RFH}=0, [Rit13], does not extend beyond the symplectically aspherical situation. We give a conjectural explanation in terms of the Cieliebak-Frauenfelder-Oancea long exact sequence [CFO10].
