We establish a formula for the Gromov-Witten-Welschinger invariants of \mathbb CP^3 with mixed real and conjugate point constraints. The method is based on a suggestion by J. Koll\'ar that, considering pencils of quadrics, some real and complex enumerative invariants of \mathbb CP^3 could be computed in terms of enumerative invariants of \mathbb CP^1\times\mathbb CP^1 and of elliptic curves.
