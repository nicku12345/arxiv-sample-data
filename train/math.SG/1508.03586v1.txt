We introduce a multiplicative version of complex-symplectic implosion in the case of SL(n, \C).   The universal multiplicative implosion for SL(n, \C) is an affine variety and can be viewed as a nonreductive geometric invariant theory quotient. It carries a torus action. and reductions by this action give the Steinberg fibres of SL(n, \C). We also explain how the real symplectic group-valued universal implosion introduced by Hurtubise, Jeffrey and Sjamaar may be identified inside this space.
