We prove the following middle-dimensional non-squeezing result for analytic symplectic embeddings of domains in \mathbb{R}^{2n}. Let \varphi: D \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2n} be an analytic symplectic embedding of a domain D \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n} and P be a symplectic projector onto a linear 2k-dimensional symplectic subspace V\subset \mathbb{R}^{2n}. Then there exists a positive function r_0:D\rightarrow (0,+ \infty), bounded away from 0 on compact subsets K \subset D, such that the inequality Vol_{2k}(P\varphi (B_r(x)),\omega ^k _{0|V})\geq \pi^{k} r^{2k} holds for every x \in D and for every r < r_0(x). This claim will be deduced from an analytic middle-dimensional non-squeezing result (stated by considering paths of symplectic embeddings) whose proof will be carried on by taking advantage of a work by \'{A}lvarez Paiva and Balacheff.
