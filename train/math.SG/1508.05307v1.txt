We use parameterized Morse theory on the pages of an open book decomposition to efficiently encode the contact topology in terms of a labelled graph on a disjoint union of tori (one per binding component). This construction allows us to generalize the notion of the front projection of a Legendrian knot from the standard contact \mathbb{R}^3 to arbitrary closed contact 3-manifolds. We describe a complete set of moves on such front diagrams, extending the standard Legendrian Reidemeister moves, and we give a combinatorial formula to compute the Thurston-Bennequin number of a nullhomologous Legendrian knot from its front projection.
