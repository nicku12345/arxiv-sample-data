We give a method for constructing a Legendrian representative of a knot in S^3 which realizes its maximal Thurston-Bennequin number under a certain condition. The method utilizes Stein handle decompositions of D^4, and the resulting Legendrian representative is often very complicated (relative to the complexity of the topological knot type). As an application, we construct infinitely many knots in S^3 each of which yields a reducible 3-manifold by a Legendrian surgery in the standard tight contact structure. This disproves a conjecture of Lidman and Sivek.
