In this paper, we give partial answers to the following questions: Which contact manifolds are contactomorphic to links of isolated complex singularities? Which symplectic manifolds are symplectomorphic to smooth affine varieties? The invariant that we will use to distinguish such manifolds is called the growth rate of wrapped Floer cohomology.   Using this invariant we show that if Q is a simply connected manifold whose unit cotangent bundle is contactomorphic to the link of an isolated singularity or whose cotangent bundle is symplectomorphic to a smooth affine variety then M must be rationally elliptic and so it must have certain bounds on its Betti numbers.
