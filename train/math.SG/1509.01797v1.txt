A long-standing conjecture states that all normalized symplectic capacities coincide on the class of convex subsets of {\mathbb R}^{2n}. In this note we focus on an asymptotic (in the dimension) version of this conjecture, and show that when restricted to the class of centrally symmetric convex bodies in {\mathbb R}^{2n}, several symplectic capacities, including the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity, the displacement energy capacity, and the cylindrical capacity, are all equivalent up to an absolute constant.
