The link of the A_n singularity, L_{A_n} \subset \mathbb{C}^3 admits a natural contact structure \xi_0 coming from the set of complex tangencies. The canonical contact form \alpha_0 associated to \xi_0 is degenerate and thus has no isolated Reeb orbits. We show that there is a nondegenerate contact form for a contact structure equivalent to \xi_0 that has two isolated simple periodic Reeb orbits. We compute the Conley-Zehnder index of these simple orbits and their iterates. From these calculations we compute the positive S^1-equivariant symplectic homology groups for \left(L_{A_n}, \xi_0 \right). In addition, we prove that \left(L_{A_n}, \xi_0 \right) is contactomorphic to the Lens space L(n+1,n), equipped with its canonical contact structure \xi_{std}.
