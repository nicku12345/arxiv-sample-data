For a Poisson manifold M we develop systematic methods to compute its Picard group Pic(M), i.e., its group of self Morita equivalences. We establish a precise relationship between Pic(M) and the group of gauge transformations up to Poisson diffeomorphisms showing, in particular, that their connected components of the identity coincide; this allows us to introduce the Picard Lie algebra of M and to study its basic properties. Our methods lead, in particular, to the proof of a conjecture from [BW04] stating that for any compact simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} the group Pic(\mathfrak{g}^*) concides with the group of outer automorphisms of \mathfrak{g}.
