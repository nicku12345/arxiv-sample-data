We identify thirteen isomorphism classes of indecomposable coisotropic relations between Poisson vector spaces and show that every coisotropic relation between finite-dimensional Poisson vector spaces may be decomposed as a direct sum of multiples of these indecomposables. We also find a list of thirteen invariants, each of which is the dimension of a space constructed from the relation, such that the 13-vector of multiplicities and the 13-vector of invariants are related by an invertible matrix over \mathbb Z.   It turns out to be simpler to do the analysis above for isotropic relations between presymplectic vector spaces. The coisotropic/Poisson case then follows by a simple duality argument.
