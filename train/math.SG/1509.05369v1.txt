If K is a compact, connected, simply connected Lie group, its based loop group \Omega K is endowed with a Hamiltonian S^1 \times T action, where T is a maximal torus of K. Atiyah and Pressley examined the image of \Omega K under the moment map \mu, while Jeffrey and Mare examined the corresponding image of the real locus \Omega K^\tau for a compatible anti-symplectic involution \tau. Both papers generalize well known results in finite dimensions, specifically the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem, and Duistermaat's convexity theorem. In the spirit of Kirwan's convexity theorem, this paper aims to further generalize the two aforementioned results by demonstrating convexity of \Omega K and its real locus \Omega K^\tau in the full non-abelian regime, resulting from the Hamiltonian S^1\times K action. In particular, this is done by appealing to the Bruhat decomposition of the algebraic (affine) Grassmannian, and appealing to the "highest weight polytope" results for Borel-invariant varieties of Guillemin and Sjamaar and Goldberg.
