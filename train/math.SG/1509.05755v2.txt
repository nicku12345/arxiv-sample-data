In this paper we obtain sharp obstructions to the symplectic embedding of the lagrangian bidisk into four-dimensional balls, ellipsoids and symplectic polydisks. We prove, in fact, that the interior of the lagrangian bidisk is symplectomorphic to a concave toric domain using ideas that come from billiards on a round disk. In particular, we answer a question of Ostrover. We also obtain sharp obstructions to some embeddings of ellipsoids into the lagrangian bidisk.
