The aim of this paper is to describe how to obtain residue-type formulas for push-forwards in equivariant cohomology, using the Jeffrey-Kirwan nonabelian localization theorem and the related result of Guillemin and Kalkman. This paper relates the description of equivariant push-forwards for homogeneous spaces of classical Lie groups with the action of the maximal torus with symplectic geometry, using the example of projective spaces and classical Grassmannians.
