We give a general definition of weakly stable nodal L_k^p-maps as a natural generalization of the stability for J-holomorphic nodal maps in GW theory. A complete characterization of the weakly stable nodal L_k^p-maps are given in term of their isotropy groups. Some errors in the earlier version are corrected
