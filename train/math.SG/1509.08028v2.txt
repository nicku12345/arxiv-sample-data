In this paper we introduce the following new ingredients: (1) rework on part of the Lagrangian surgery theory; (2) constructions of Lagrangian cobordisms on product symplectic manifolds; (3) extending Biran-Cornea Lagrangian cobordism theory to the immersed category.   As a result, we manifest Seidel's exact sequences (both the Lagrangian version and the symplectomorphism version), as well as Wehrheim-Woodward's family Dehn twist sequence (including the codimension-1 case missing in the literature) as consequences of our surgery/cobordism constructions.   Moreover, we obtain an expression of the autoequivalence of Fukaya category induced by Dehn twists along Lagrangian \mathbb{RP}^n, \mathbb{CP}^n and \mathbb{HP}^n, which matches Huybrechts-Thomas's mirror prediction of the \mathbb{CP}^n case modulo connecting maps. We also prove the split generation of any symplectomorphism by Dehn twists in ADE-type Milnor fibers.
