We obtain a formula for the number of genus one curves with a fixed complex structure of a given degree on a del-Pezzo surface that pass through an appropriate number of generic points of the surface. This enumerative problem is expressed as the difference between the symplectic invariant and an intersection number on the moduli space of rational curves.
