In this paper we show that 0-resolution of a crossing in the Legendrian closure of a positive braid induces a cohomologically faithful A_\infty functor on augmentation categories. In particular, we compute the bilinearized Legendrian contact cohomology of these knots for augmentations induced by 0-resolution.
