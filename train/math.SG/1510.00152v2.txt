Let (\mathbb T^2,g) be a Riemannian two-torus and let \sigma be an oscillating 2-form on \mathbb T^2. We show that for almost every small positive number k the magnetic flow of the pair (g,\sigma) has infinitely many periodic orbits with energy k. This result complements the analogous statement for closed surfaces of genus at least 2 [Asselle and Benedetti, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations, 2015] and at the same time extends the main theorem in [Abbondandolo, Macarini, Mazzucchelli, and Paternain, J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS), to appear] to the non-exact oscillating case.
