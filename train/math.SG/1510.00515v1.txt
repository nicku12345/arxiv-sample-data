A contact manifold admittting a supporting contact form without contractible Reeb orbits is called hypertight. In this paper we construct a Rabinowitz Floer homology associated to an arbitrary supporting contact form for a hypertight contact manifold, and use this to prove versions of conjectures of Sandon and Mazzucchelli on the existence of translated points and invariant Reeb orbits, and to show that positive loops of contactomorphisms give rise to non-contractible Reeb orbits.
