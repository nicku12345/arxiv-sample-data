The author proved that if the circle acts symplectically on a compact, connected symplectic manifold M with three fixed points, then M is equivariantly symplectomorphic to some standard action on \mathbb{CP}^2. In this paper, we extend the result to a circle action on an almost complex manifold; if the circle acts on a compact, connected almost complex manifold M with exactly three fixed points, then \dim M=4. Moreover, we deal with the cases of one fixed point and two fixed points.
