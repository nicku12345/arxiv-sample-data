We present a new existence mechanism, based on symplectic topology, for orbits of Hamiltonian flows connecting a pair of disjoint subsets in the phase space. The method involves function theory on symplectic manifolds combined with rigidity of Lagrangian submanifolds. Applications include superconductivity channels in nearly integrable systems and dynamics near a perturbed unstable equilibrium.
