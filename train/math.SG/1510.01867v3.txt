We introduce a class of Weinstein domains which are sublevel sets of flexible Weinstein manifolds but are not themselves flexible. These manifolds exhibit rather subtle behavior with respect to both holomorphic curve invariants and symplectic flexibility. We construct a large class of examples and prove that every flexible Weinstein manifold can be Weinstein homotoped to have a nonflexible sublevel set.
