We prove a structural result in mirror symmetry for projective Calabi--Yau (CY) manifolds. Let X be a connected symplectic CY manifold, whose Fukaya category \mathcal{F}(X) is defined over some suitable Novikov field \mathbb{K}; its mirror is assumed to be some smooth projective scheme Y over \mathbb{K} with `maximally unipotent monodromy'. Suppose that some split-generating subcategory of (a \mathsf{dg} enhancement of) D^bCoh( Y) embeds into \mathcal{F}(X): we call this hypothesis `core homological mirror symmetry'. We prove that the embedding extends to an equivalence of categories, D^bCoh(Y) \cong D^\pi( \mathcal{F}(X)), using Abouzaid's split-generation criterion. Our results are not sensitive to the details of how the Fukaya category is set up. In work-in-preparation [PS], we establish the necessary foundational tools in the setting of the `relative Fukaya category', which is defined using classical transversality theory.
