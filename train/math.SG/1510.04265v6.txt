We construct Hamiltonian Floer complexes associated to continuous, and even lower semi-continuous, time dependent exhaustion functions on geometrically bounded symplectic manifolds. We further construct functorial continuation maps associated to monotone homotopies between them, and operations which give rise to a product and unit. The work rests on novel techniques for energy confinement of Floer solutions as well as on methods of Non-Archimedean analysis. The definition for general Hamiltonians utilizes the notion of reduced cohomology familiar from Riemannian geometry, and the continuity properties of Floer cohomology. This gives rise in particular to localized Floer theory. We discuss various functorial properties as well as some applications to existence of periodic orbits and to displaceability.
