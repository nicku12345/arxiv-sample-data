We establish a Hard Lefschetz Theorem for the de Rham cohomology of compact Vaisman manifolds. A similar result is proved for the basic cohomology with respect to the Lee vector field. Motivated by these results, we introduce the notions of a Lefschetz and of a basic Lefschetz locally conformal symplectic (l.c.s.) manifold of the first kind. We prove that the two notions are equivalent if there exists a Riemannian metric such that the Lee vector field is unitary and parallel and its metric dual 1-form coincides with the Lee 1-form. Finally, we discuss several examples of compact l.c.s. manifolds of the first kind which do not admit compatible Vaisman metrics.
