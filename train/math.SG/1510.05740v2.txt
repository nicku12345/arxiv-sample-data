The goal of this paper is to classify symplectic toric stratified spaces with isolated singularities. This extends a result of Burns, Guillemin, and Lerman which carries out this classification in the compact connected case. In making this classification, it is necessary to classify symplectic toric cones. Via a well-known equivalence between symplectic toric cones and contact toric manifolds, this allows for the classification of contact toric manifolds as well, extending Lerman's classification of compact connected contact toric manifolds.
