Given a Legendrian link in \#^k(S^1\times S^2), we extend the definition of a normal ruling from J^1(S^1) given by Lavrov and Rutherford and show that the existence of an augmentation to any field of the Chekanov-Eliashberg differential graded algebra over \mathbb{Z}[t,t^{-1}] is equivalent to the existence of a normal ruling of the front diagram. For Legendrian knots, we also show that any even graded augmentation must send t to -1. We use the correspondence to give nonvanishing results for the symplectic homology of certain Weinstein 4-manifolds. We show a similar correspondence for the related case of Legendrian links in J^1(S^1), the solid torus.
