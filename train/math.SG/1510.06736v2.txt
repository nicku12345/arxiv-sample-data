We study the topology of exact and Stein fillings of the canonical contact structure on the unit cotangent bundle of a closed surface \Sigma_g, where g is at least 2. In particular, we prove a uniqueness theorem asserting that any Stein filling must be s-cobordant rel boundary to the disk cotangent bundle of \Sigma_g. For exact fillings, we show that the rational homology agrees with that of the disk cotangent bundle, and that the integral homology takes on finitely many possible values: for example, if g-1 is square-free, then any exact filling has the same integral homology and intersection form as DT^*\Sigma_g.
