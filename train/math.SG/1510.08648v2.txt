In this paper, we prove that for every index perfect non-degenerate compact star-shaped hypersurface \Sigma\subset{\bf R}^{2n}, there exist at least n non-hyperbolic closed characteristics with even Maslov-type indices on \Sigma when n is even. When n is odd, there exist at least n closed characteristics with odd Maslov-type indices on \Sigma and at least (n-1) of them are non-hyperbolic. Here we call a compact star-shaped hypersurface \Sigma\subset {\bf R}^{2n} {\rm index perfect} if it carries only finitely many geometrically distinct prime closed characteristics, and every prime closed characteristic (\tau,y) on \Sigma possesses positive mean index and whose Maslov-type index i(y, m) of its m-th iterate satisfies i(y, m)\not= -1 when n is even, and i(y, m)\not\in \{-2,-1,0\} when n is odd for all m\in {\bf N}.
