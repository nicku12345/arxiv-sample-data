Donaldson showed that every closed symplectic 4-manifold can be given the structure of a topological Lefschetz pencil. Gay and Kirby showed that every closed 4-manifold has a trisection. In this paper we relate these two structure theorems, showing how to construct a trisection directly from a topological Lefschetz pencil. This trisection is such that each of the three sectors is a regular neighborhood of a regular fiber of the pencil. This is a 4-dimensional analog of the following trivial 3-dimensional result: For every open book decomposition of a 3-manifold M, there is a decomposition of M into three handlebodies, each of which is a regular neighborhood of a page.
