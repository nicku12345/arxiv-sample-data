Assume that we are given a closed chord-generic Legendrian submanifold \Lambda \subset P \times \mathbb R of the contactisation of a Liouville manifold, where \Lambda moreover admits an exact Lagrangian filling L_{\Lambda} \subset \mathbb R \times P \times \mathbb R inside the symplectisation. Under the further assumptions that this filling is spin and has vanishing Maslov class, we prove that the number of Reeb chords on \Lambda is bounded from below by the stable Morse number of L_{\Lambda}. Given a general exact Lagrangian filling L_{\Lambda}, we show that the number of Reeb chords is bounded from below by a quantity depending on the homotopy type of L_{\Lambda}, following Ono-Pajitnov's implementation in Floer homology of invariants due to Sharko. This improves previously known bounds in terms of the Betti numbers of either \Lambda or L_{\Lambda}.
