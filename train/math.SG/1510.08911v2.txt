We study versions of homological mirror symmetry for hypersurface cusp singularities and the three hypersurface simple elliptic singularities. We show that the Milnor fibres of each of these carries a distinguished Lefschetz fibration; its derived directed Fukaya category is equivalent to the derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth rational surface Y_{p,q,r}. By using localization techniques on both sides, we get an isomorphism between the derived wrapped Fukaya category of the Milnor fibre and the derived category of coherent sheaves on a quasi-projective surface given by deleting an anti-canonical divisor D from Y_{p,q,r}. In the cusp case, the pair (Y_{p,q,r}, D) is naturally associated to the dual cusp singularity, tying into Gross, Hacking and Keel's proof of Looijenga's conjecture.
