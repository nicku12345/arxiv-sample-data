We construct an embedding of the full braid group on m+1 strands B_{m+1}, m \geq 1, into the contact mapping class group of the contactization Q \times S^1 of the A_m-Milnor fiber Q. The construction uses the embedding of B_{m+1} into the symplectic mapping class group of Q due to Khovanov and Seidel, and a natural lifting homomorphism. In order to show that the composed homomorphism is still injective, we use a partially linearized variant of the Chekanov--Eliashberg dga for Legendrians which lie above one another in Q \times \mathbb{R}, reducing the proof to Floer homology. As corollaries we obtain a contribution to the contact isotopy problem for Q \times S^1, as well as the fact that in dimension 4, the lifting homomorphism embeds the symplectic mapping class group of Q into the contact mapping class group of Q \times S^1.
