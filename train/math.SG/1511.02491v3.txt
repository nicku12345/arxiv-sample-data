We survey the concept of multiplicativity from its initial appearance in the theory of Poisson-Lie groups to the far-reaching generalizations, for multivectors and differential forms in the geometry and the generalized geometry of Lie groupoids, as well as their infinitesimal counterparts in the theory of Lie algebroids.
