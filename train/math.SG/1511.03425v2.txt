We construct a topological sigma model and a current algebra based on a Courant algebroid structure on a Poisson manifold. In order to construct models, we reformulate the Poisson Courant algebroid by supergeometric construction on a QP-manifold. A new duality of Courant algebroids which transforms H-flux and R-flux is proposed, where the transformation is interpreted as a canonical transformation of a graded symplectic manifold.
