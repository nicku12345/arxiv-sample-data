We introduce a notion of cardinality for the augmentation category associated to a Legendrian knot or link in standard contact R^3. This `homotopy cardinality' is an invariant of the category and allows for a weighted count of augmentations, which we prove to be determined by the ruling polynomial of the link. We present an application to the augmentation category of doubly Lagrangian slice knots.
