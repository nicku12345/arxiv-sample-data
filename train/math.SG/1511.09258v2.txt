Conditions are given under which an infinitesimal automorphism of a torsion-free connection preserving a symplectic form is necessarily a symplectic vector field. An example is given of a compact symplectic manifold admitting a flat symplectic connection and an infinitesimal automorphism that is not symplectic.
