The following interesting quantity was introduced by K. Cieliebak and K. Mohnke for a Lagrangian submanifold L of a symplectic manifold: the minimal positive symplectic area of a disc with boundary on L. They also showed that this quantity is bounded from above by \pi/n for a Lagrangian torus inside the 2n-dimensional unit disc equipped with the standard symplectic form. A Lagrangian torus for which this upper bound is attained is called extremal. We show that an extremal Lagrangian torus inside the four-dimensional unit disc is contained in the boundary \partial D^4=S^3, and is hence Hamiltonian isotopic to the product torus S^1_{1/\sqrt{2}} \times S^1_{1/\sqrt{2}} \subset S^3. This provides an answer to a question by L. Lazzarini in the four-dimensional case.
