We define the contact homology algebra for any contact manifold and show that it is an invariant of the contact manifold. More precisely, given a contact manifold (M,\xi) and some auxiliary data \mathcal{D}, we define an algebra HC(\mathcal{D}). If \mathcal{D}_1 and \mathcal{D}_2 are two choices of auxiliary data for (M,\xi), then HC(\mathcal{D}_1) and HC(\mathcal{D}_2) are isomorphic. We use a simplified version of Kuranishi perturbation theory, consisting of semi-global Kuranishi charts.
