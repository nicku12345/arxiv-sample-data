This is a research announcement on an alternative definition of the Casson invariants by means of virtual counting of the moduli space of irreducible representations of the fundamental group into \SU(2). Along the way, by using derived differential geometry, we propose a general framework to obtain invariants from Chern-Simons type gauge theories.
