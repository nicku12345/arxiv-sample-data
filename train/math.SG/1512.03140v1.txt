Let (M, \xi) be a compact contact 3-manifold and assume that there exists a contact form \alpha_0 on (M, \xi) whose Reeb flow is Anosov. We show this implies that every Reeb flow on (M, \xi) has positive topological entropy. Our argument builds on previous work of the author (http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3380) and recent work of Barthelm\'e and Fenley (http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07999).   This result combined with the work of Foulon and Hasselblatt (http://www.tufts.edu/as/math/Preprints/FoulonHasselblattLegendrian.pdf) is then used to obtain the first examples of hyperbolic contact 3-manifolds on which every Reeb flow has positive topological entropy.
