A 2n-dimensional Poisson manifold (M ,\Pi) is said to be b^m-symplectic if it is symplectic on the complement of a hypersurface Z and has a simple Darboux canonical form at points of Z which we will describe below. In this paper we will discuss a desingularization procedure which, for m even, converts \Pi into a family of symplectic forms \omega_{\epsilon} having the property that \omega_{\epsilon} is equal to the b^m-symplectic form dual to \Pi outside an \epsilon-neighborhood of Z and, in addition, converges to this form as \epsilon tends to zero in a sense that will be made precise in the theorem below. We will then use this construction to show that a number of somewhat mysterious properties of b^m-manifolds can be more clearly understood by viewing them as limits of analogous properties of the \omega_{\epsilon}'s. We will also prove versions of these results for m odd; however, in the odd case the family \omega_{\epsilon} has to be replaced by a family of folded symplectic forms.
