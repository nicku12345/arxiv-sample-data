We define Gromov--Witten invariants of exploded manifolds. The technical heart of this paper is a construction of a virtual fundamental class [\mathcal K] of any Kuranishi category \mathcal K (which is a simplified, more general version of an embedded Kuranishi structure.) We also show how to integrate differential forms over [\mathcal K] to obtain numerical invariants, and push forward differential forms from \mathcal K over suitable evaluation maps. We show that such invariants are independent of any choices, and are compatible with pullbacks, products, and tropical completion of Kuranishi categories.   In the case of a compact symplectic manifold, this gives an alternative construction of Gromov--Witten invariants, including gravitational descendants.
