In this paper, we explore the structure of Rabinowitz--Floer homology RFH_* on contact manifolds whose Reeb flow is periodic (and which satisfy an index condition such that RFH_* is independent of the filling). The main result is that RFH_* is a module over the Laurent polynomials \mathbb{Z}_2[s,s^{-1}], where s is the homology class generated by a principal Reeb orbit and the module structure is given by the pair-of-pants product. In most cases, this module is free and finitely generated.
