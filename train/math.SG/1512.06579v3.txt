A polynomial assignment for a continuous action of a compact torus T on a topological space X assigns to each p\in X a polynomial function on the Lie algebra of the isotropy group at p in such a way that a certain compatibility condition is satisfied. The space {\mathcal{A}}_T(X) of all polynomial assignments has a natural structure of an algebra over the polynomial ring of {\rm Lie}(T). It is an equivariant homotopy invariant, canonically related to the equivariant cohomology algebra. In this paper we prove various properties of {\mathcal{A}}_T(X) such as Borel localization, a Chang-Skjelbred lemma, and a Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson presentation. In the special case of Hamiltonian torus actions on symplectic manifolds we prove a surjectivity criterion for the assignment equivariant Kirwan map corresponding to a circle in T. We then obtain a Tolman-Weitsman type presentation of the kernel of this map.
