We show that the moduli space of regular affine vortices, which are solutions of the symplectic vortex equation over the complex plane, has the structure of a smooth manifold. The construction uses Ziltener's Fredholm theory results [31]. We also extend the result to the case of affine vortices over the upper half plane. These results are necessary ingredients in defining the "open quantum Kirwan map" proposed by Woodward [24].
