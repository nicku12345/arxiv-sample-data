We define a \mathbb{Z}_k-equivariant version of the cylindrical contact homology used by Eliashberg-Kim-Polterovich (2006) to prove contact non-squeezing for prequantized integer-capacity balls B(R) \times S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1, R \in \mathbb{N} and we use it to extend their result to all R \geq 1. Specifically we prove if R \geq 1 there is no \psi\in \text{Cont}(\mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1), the group of compactly supported contactomorphisms of \mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1 which squeezes \hat{B}(R) = B(R) \times S^1 into itself, i.e. maps the closure of \hat{B}(R) into \hat{B}(R). A sheaf theoretic proof of non-existence of corresponding \psi \in \text{Cont}_0(\mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1), the identity component of \text{Cont}(\mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1), is due to Chiu (2014); it is not known if this is strictly weaker. Our construction has the advantage of retaining the contact homological viewpoint of Eliashberg-Kim-Polterovich and its potential for application in prequantizations of other Liouville manifolds. It makes use of the \mathbb{Z}_k-action generated by a vertical 1/k-shift but can also be related, for prequantized balls, to the \mathbb{Z}_k-equivariant contact homology developed by Milin (2008) in her proof of orderability of lens spaces.
