We exhibit the traceless SU(2) character variety of a 6-punctured 2-sphere as a 2-fold branched cover of {\mathbb{C}}P^3, branched over the singular Kummer surface, with the branch locus in R(S^2,6) corresponding to the binary dihedral representations. This follows from an analysis of the map induced on SU(2) character varieties by the 2-fold branched cover F_{n-1}\to S^2 branched over 2n points, combined with the theorem of Narasimhan-Ramanan which identifies R(F_2) with {\mathbb{C}} P^3. The singular points of R(S^2,6) correspond to abelian representations, and we prove that each has a neighborhood in R(S^2,6) homeomorphic to a cone on S^2\times S^3.
