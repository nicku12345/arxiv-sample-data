Let G be a connected complex semisimple Lie group with a fixed maximal torus T and a Borel subgroup B \supset T. For an arbitrary automorphism \theta of G, we introduce a holomorphic Poisson structure \pi_\theta on G which is invariant under the \theta-twisted conjugation by T and has the property that every \theta-twisted conjugacy class of G is a Poisson subvariety with respect to \pi_\theta. We describe the T-orbits of symplectic leaves, called T-leaves, of \pi_\theta and compute the dimensions of the symplectic leaves (i.e, the ranks) of \pi_\theta. We give the lowest rank of \pi_\theta in any given \theta-twisted conjugacy class, and we relate the lowest possible rank locus of \pi_\theta in G with spherical \theta-twisted conjugacy classes of G. In particular, we show that \pi_\theta vanishes somewhere on G if and only if \theta induces an involution on the Dynkin diagram of G, and that in such a case a \theta-twisted conjugacy class C contains a vanishing point of \pi_\theta if and only if C is spherical.
