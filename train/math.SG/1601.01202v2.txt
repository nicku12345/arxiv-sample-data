Let (M,\omega) be a symplectic 4-manifold of negative Kodaira dimension. Let C be an \omega-symplectic curve, J-holomorphic for some J tamed by \omega. Then [C]^2 is bounded below by a constant depending only on \omega. Related bounded negativity problems for other structures are also briefly discussed. In particular, the symplectic result implies the bounded negativity conjecture for complex projective surfaces with Kodaira dimension \kappa=-\infty.
