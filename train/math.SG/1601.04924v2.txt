We construct partial category-valued field theories in (2+1)-dimensions using Lagrangian Floer theory in moduli spaces of central-curvature unitary connections with fixed determinant of rank r and degree d where r,d are coprime positive integers. These theories associate to a closed, connected, oriented surface the Fukaya category of the moduli space, and to a connected bordism between two surfaces a functor between the Fukaya categories. We obtain the latter by combining Cerf theory with holomorphic quilt invariants.
