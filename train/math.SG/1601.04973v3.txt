We recently defined an invariant of contact manifolds with convex boundary in Kronheimer and Mrowka's sutured monopole Floer homology theory. Here, we prove that there is an isomorphism between sutured monopole Floer homology and sutured Heegaard Floer homology which identifies our invariant with the contact class defined by Honda, Kazez and Mati\'c in the latter theory. One consequence is that the Legendrian invariants in knot Floer homology behave functorially with respect to Lagrangian concordance. In particular, these invariants provide computable and effective obstructions to the existence of such concordances. Our work also provides the first proof which does not rely on the relative Giroux correspondence that the vanishing or non-vanishing of Honda, Kazez and Mati\'c's contact class is a well-defined invariant of contact manifolds.
