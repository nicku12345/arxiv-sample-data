[GGSM2] showed that height functions give adjoint orbits of semisimple Lie algebras the structure of symplectic Lefschetz fibrations (superpotential of the LG model in the language of mirror symmetry). We describe how to extend the superpotential to compactifications. Our results explore the geometry of the adjoint orbit from 2 points of view: algebraic geometry and Lie theory.
