A surgery of a real symplectic manifold X_{\mathbb R} along a real Lagrangian sphere S is a modification of the symplectic and real structure on X_{\mathbb R} in a neigborhood of S. Genus 0 Welschinger invariants of two real symplectic 4-manifolds differing by such a surgery have been related in a previous work in collaboration with N. Puignau. In the present paper, we explore some particular situations where these general formulas greatly simplify. As an application, we complete the computation of genus 0 Welschinger invariants of all del~Pezzo surfaces, and of all \mathbb R-minimal real conic bundles. As a by-product, we establish the existence of some new relative Welschinger invariants. We also generalize our results to the enumeration of curves of higher genus, and give relations between hypothetical invariants defined in the same vein as a previous work by Shustin.
