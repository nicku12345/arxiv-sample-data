We prove that, on a closed surface, a Lagrangian system defined by a Tonelli Lagrangian L possesses a periodic orbit that is a local minimizer of the free-period action functional on every energy level belonging to the low range of energies (e_0(L),c_{\mathrm{u}}(L)). We also prove that almost every energy level in (e_0(L),c_{\mathrm{u}}(L)) possesses infinitely many periodic orbits. These statements extend two results, respectively due to Taimanov and Abbondandolo-Macarini-Mazzucchelli-Paternain, valid for the special case of electromagnetic Lagrangians.
