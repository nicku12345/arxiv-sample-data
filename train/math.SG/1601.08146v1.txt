Let (X,J) be an almost-complex manifold. In \cite{li-zhang} Li and Zhang introduce H^{(p,q),(q,p)}_J(X)_{\rr} as the cohomology subgroups of the (p+q)-th de Rham cohomology group formed by classes represented by real pure-type forms. Given a proper, surjective, pseudo-holomorphic map between two almost-complex manifolds we study the relationship among such cohomology groups. Similar results are proven in the symplectic setting for the cohomology groups introduced in \cite{tsengyauI} by Tseng and Yau and a new characterization of the Hard Lefschetz condition in dimension 4 is provided.
