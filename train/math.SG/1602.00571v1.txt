We define Maslov--type indices associated to contact and symplectic transformation groups. There are two such families of indices. The first class of indices are maps from the homotopy groups of the contactomorphism or symplectomorphism group to a quotient of the integers. These are based on a generalization of the Maslov index. The second class of indices are maps from the homotopy groups of the space of contact structures or the space of cohomologous symplectic forms to the homotopy groups of a simple homogeneous space. We provide a detailed construction and describe some properties of these indices and their applications.
