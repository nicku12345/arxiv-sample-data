Let (M,\psi) be a (2n+1)-dimensional oriented closed manifold equipped with a pseudo-free S^1-action \psi : S^1 \times M \rightarrow M. We first define a \textit{local data} \mathcal{L}(M,\psi) of the action \psi which consists of pairs (C, (p(C) ; \overrightarrow{q}(C))) where C is an exceptional orbit, p(C) is the order of isotropy subgroup of C, and \overrightarrow{q}(C) \in (\mathbb{Z}_{p(C)}^{\times})^n is a vector whose entries are the weights of the slice representation of C. In this paper, we give an explicit formula of the Chern number \langle c_1(E)^n, [M/S^1] \rangle modulo \mathbb{Z} in terms of the local data, where E = M \times_{S^1} \mathbb{C} is the associated complex line orbibundle over M/S^1. Also, we illustrate several applications to various problems arising in equivariant symplectic topology.
