We study blow-ups in generalized complex geometry. To that end we introduce the concept of holomorphic ideal, which allows one to define a blow-up in the category of smooth manifolds. We then investigate which generalized complex submanifolds are suitable for blowing up. Two classes naturally appear; generalized Poisson submanifolds and generalized Poisson transversals, submanifolds which look complex, respectively symplectic in transverse directions. We show that generalized Poisson submanifolds carry a canonical holomorphic ideal and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the corresponding blow-up to be generalized complex. For the generalized Poisson transversals we give a normal form for a neighborhood of the submanifold, and use that to define a generalized complex blow-up, which is up to deformation independent of choices.
