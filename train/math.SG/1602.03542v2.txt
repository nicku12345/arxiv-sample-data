In this paper we generalize constructions of non-commutative integrable systems to the context of weakly Hamiltonian actions on Poisson manifolds. In particular we prove that abelian weakly Hamiltonian actions on symplectic manifolds split into Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian factors, and explore generalizations in the Poisson setting.
