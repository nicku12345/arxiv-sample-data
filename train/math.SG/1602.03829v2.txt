The twistor space of a Riemannian 4-manifold carries two almost complex structures, J_+ and J_-, and a natural closed 2-form \omega. This article studies limits of manifolds for which \omega tames either J_+ or J_-. This amounts to a curvature inequality involving self-dual Weyl curvature and Ricci curvature, and which is satisfied, for example, by all anti-self-dual Einstein manifolds with non-zero scalar curvature. We prove that if a sequence of manifolds satisfying the curvature inequality converges to a hyperk\"ahler limit X (in the C^2 pointed topology) then X cannot contain a holomorphic 2-sphere (for any of its hyperk\"ahler complex structures). In particular, this rules out the formation of bubbles modelled on ALE gravitational instantons in such families of metrics.
