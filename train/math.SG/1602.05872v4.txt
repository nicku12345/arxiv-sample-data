We establish a characterization for an m-manifold M to admit n functions f_1,...,f_n and n' functions g_1,...,g_{n'} in \mathcal{C}^\infty(M) so that every element of \mathcal{C}^k(M) can be approximated by rational combinations of f_1,...,f_n and polynomial combinations of g_1,...,g_{n'}. As an application, we show that the optimal value of n and n' for all manifolds of dimension m is [3m/2], when k\geq 1 and m\geq 2.
