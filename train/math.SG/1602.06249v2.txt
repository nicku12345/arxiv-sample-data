Let S^*Q be the spherization of a closed connected manifold of dimension at least two. Consider a contactomorphism \varphi that can be reached by a contact isotopy that is everywhere positively transverse to the contact structure. In other words, \varphi is the time-1-map of a time-dependent Reeb flow. We show that the volume growth of \varphi is bounded from below by the topological complexity of the loop space of Q. Denote by \Omega Q_0(q) the component of the based loop space that contains the constant loop. We show that if the fundamental group or the homology of \Omega Q_0(q) grows exponentially, then the volume growth of \varphi is exponential, and thus its topological entropy is positive. A similar statement holds for polynomial growths. This result generalizes work of Dinaburg, Gromov, Paternain and Petean on geodesic flows and of Macarini, Frauenfelder, Labrousse and Schlenk on Reeb flows. Our main tool is a version of Rabinowitz--Floer homology developed by Albers and Frauenfelder.
