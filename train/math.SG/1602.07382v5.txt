We introduce Morse branes in the Fukaya category of a holomorphic symplectic manifold, with the goal of constructing tilting objects in the category. We give a construction of a class of Morse branes in the cotangent bundles, and apply it to give the holomorphic branes that represent the big tilting sheaves on flag varieties.
