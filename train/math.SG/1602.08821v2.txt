We show that, up to Lagrangian isotopy, there is a unique Lagrangian torus inside each of the following uniruled symplectic four-manifolds: the symplectic vector space \mathbb{R}^4, the projective plane \mathbb{C}P^2, and the monotone S^2 \times S^2. The result is proven by studying pseudoholomorphic foliations while performing the splitting construction from symplectic field theory along the Lagrangian torus. A number of other related results are also shown. Notably, the nearby Lagrangian conjecture is established for T^*\mathbb{T}^2, i.e.~it is shown that every closed exact Lagrangian submanifold in this cotangent bundle is Hamiltonian isotopic to the zero-section.
