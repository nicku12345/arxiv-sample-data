We construct a family of Lagrangian tori \Theta^n_s \subset (\mathbb{C}P^1)^n, s \in (0,1), where \Theta^n_{1/2} = \Theta^n, is the monotone twist Lagrangian torus described by Chekanov-Schlenk. We show that for n = 2m and s \ge 1/2 these tori are non-displaceable. Then by considering \Theta^{k_1}_{s_1}  \times \cdots \times  \Theta^{k_l}_{s_l}  \times  (S^2_{\mathrm{eq}})^{n - \sum_i k_i}  \subset  (\mathbb{C}P^1)^n, with s_i \in [1/2,1) and k_i \in 2\mathbb{Z}_{>0}, \sum_i k_i \le n we get several l-dimensional families of non-displaceable Lagrangian tori. We also show that there exists partial symplectic quasi-states \zeta^{\mathfrak{b}_s}_{\textbf{e}_s} and linearly independent homogeneous Calabi quasimorphims \mu^{\mathfrak{b}_s}_{\textbf{e}_s} or which \Theta^{2m}_s are \zeta^{\mathfrak{b}_s}_{\textbf{e}_s}-superheavy and \mu^{\mathfrak{b}_s}_{\textbf{e}_s}-superheavy. We also prove a similar result for (\mathbb{C}P^2 3\bar{\mathbb{C}P^2}, \omega_\epsilon), where \{\omega_\epsilon; 0 < \epsilon < 1\} is a family of symplectic forms in \mathbb{C}P^2 3\bar{\mathbb{C}P^2}, for which \omega_{1/2} is monotone.
