We prove here a quantitative h-principle statement that applies to isotropic embeddings of discs. We then apply it to get C^0-flexibility and rigidity results in symplectic geometry. On the flexible side, we prove that a symplectic homeomorphism might take a symplectic disc to a smooth isotropic one. We also get a C^0-rigidity result for the action of a symplectic homeomorphism on the reduction of a coisotropic submanifold.
