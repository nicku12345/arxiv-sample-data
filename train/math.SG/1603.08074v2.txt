The derived category of coherent sheaves \mathcal{T}_B associated to a birational cobordism which is either a weighted projective space, a stacky Atiyah flip, or a stacky blow-up of a point has a conjectural mirror Fukaya-Seidel category \mathcal{T}_A. The potential W defining \mathcal{T}_{A} has base \mathbb{C}^* and exhibits a great deal of symmetry. This paper investigates the structure of the Fukaya-Seidel category for the mirror potentials. A proof of homological mirror symmetry \mathcal{T}_A \cong \mathcal{T}_B for these birational cobordisms is then given.
