We prove a formula for twisted Duistermaat-Heckman distributions associated to a Hamiltonian LG-space. The terms of the formula are localized at the critical points of the norm-square of the moment map, and can be computed in cross-sections. Our main tools are the theory of quasi-Hamiltonian G-spaces, as well as the Hamiltonian cobordism approach to norm-square localization introduced recently by Harada and Karshon.
