We define a new class of symplectic objects called "stops", which roughly speaking are Liouville hypersurfaces in the boundary of a Liouville domain. Locally, these can be viewed as pages of a compatible open book. To a Liouville domain with a collection of disjoint stops, we assign an A_\infty-category called its partially wrapped Fukaya category. An exact Landau-Ginzburg model gives rise to a stop, and the corresponding partially wrapped Fukaya category is meant to agree with the Fukaya category one is supposed to assign to the Landau-Ginzburg model. As evidence, we prove a formula that relates these partially wrapped Fukaya categories to the wrapped Fukaya category of the underlying Liouville domain. This operation is mirror to removing a divisor.   In v2, we also construct continuation functors without cascades, which should be of independent interest.
