We extend the notion of Poisson-Lie groups and Lie bialgebras from Poisson to g-quasi-Poisson geometry and provide a quantization to braided Hopf algebras in the corresponding Drinfeld category. The basic examples of these g-quasi-Poisson Lie groups are nilpotent radicals of parabolic subgroups. We also provide examples of moment maps in this new context coming from moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces.
