These notes were prepared in occasion of a mini-course given by the author at the "CIMPA Research School - Hamiltonian and Lagrangian Dynamics" (10-19 March 2015 - Salto, Uruguay). The talks were meant as an introduction to the problem of finding periodic orbits of prescribed energy for autonomous Tonelli Lagrangian systems on the twisted cotangent bundle of a closed manifold. In the first part of the lecture notes, we put together in a general theorem old and new results on the subject. In the second part, we focus on an important class of examples: magnetic flows on surfaces. For such systems, we discuss a special method, originally due to Taimanov, to find periodic orbits with low energy and we study in detail the stability properties of the energy levels.
