Given a closed symplectic 4-manifold (X,\omega), we define a twisted version of the Gromov-Taubes invariants for (X,\omega), where the twisting coefficients are induced by the choice of a surface bundle over X. Given a fibered 3-manifold Y, we similarly construct twisted Lefschetz zeta functions associated with surface bundles: we prove that these are essentially equivalent to the Jiang's Lefschetz zeta functions of Y, twisted by the representations of \pi_1(Y) that are induced by monodromy homomorphisms of surface bundles over Y. This leads to an interpretation of the corresponding twisted Reidemeister torsions of Y in terms of products of "local" commutative Reidemeister torsions. Finally we relate the two invariants by proving that, for any fixed closed surface bundle \mathcal{B} over Y, the corresponding twisted Lefschetz zeta function coincides with the Gromov-Taubes invariant of S^1 \times Y twisted by the bundle over S^1 \times Y naturally induced by \mathcal{B}.
