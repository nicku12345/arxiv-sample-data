We study polar representations in the sense of Dadok and Kac which are symplectic. We show that such representations are coisotropic and use this fact to give a classification. We also study their moment maps and prove that they separate closed orbits. Our work can also be seen as a specialization of some of the results of Knop on multiplicity free symplectic representations to the polar case.
