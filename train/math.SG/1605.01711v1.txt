We show that every quasipositive link has a quasipositive minimal braid representative, partially resolving a question posed by Orevkov. These quasipositive minimal braids are used to show that the maximal self-linking number of a quasipositive link is bounded below by the negative of the minimal braid index, with equality if and only if the link is an unlink. This implies that the only amphicheiral quasipositive links are the unlinks, answering a question of Rudolph's.
