Biinvariant diagonal classes give rise to right inverses of the Kirwan map. By means of multivalued perturbations of the gradient flow equation such classes are constructed explicitly for S^1-Hamiltonian spaces. Moreover, the notion of biinvariant diagonal class is extended to a cohomology map that gives extra topological information on the Hamiltonian space. The non-uniqueness of global biinvariant diagonal classes is also proven.
