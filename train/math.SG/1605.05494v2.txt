Let (X,\omega) be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 2n and let Ham(X,\omega) be its group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. We prove the existence of a constant C, depending on X but not on \omega, such that any finite subgroup G\subset Ham(X,\omega) has an abelian subgroup A\subseteq G satisfying [G:A]\leq C, and A can be generated by n elements or fewer. If b_1(X)=0 we prove an analogous statement for the entire group of symplectomorphisms of (X,\omega). If b_1(X)\neq 0 we prove the existence of a constant C' depending only on X such that any finite subgroup G\subset Symp(X,\omega) has a subgroup N\subseteq G which is either abelian or 2-step nilpotent and which satisfies [G:N]\leq C'.   These results are deduced from the classification of the finite simple groups, the topological rigidity of hamiltonian loops, and the following theorem, which we prove in this paper. Let E be a complex vector bundle over a compact, connected, smooth and oriented manifold M; suppose that the real rank of E is equal to the dimension of M, and that \langle e(E),[M]\rangle\neq 0, where e(E) is the Euler class of E; then there exists a constant C" such that, for any prime p and any finite p-group G acting on E by vector bundle automorphisms preserving an almost complex structure on M, there is a subgroup G_0\subseteq G satisfying M^{G_0}\neq\emptyset and [G:G_0]\leq C".
