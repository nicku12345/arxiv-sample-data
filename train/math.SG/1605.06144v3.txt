We extend parts of the Lagrangian spectral invariants package recently developed by Leclercq and Zapolsky to the theory of Lagrangian cobordism developed by Biran and Cornea. This yields a nondegenerate Lagrangian "spectral metric" which bounds the Lagrangian "cobordism metric" (recently introduced by Cornea and Shelukhin) from below. It also yields a new numerical Lagrangian cobordism invariant as well as new ways of computing certain asymptotic Lagrangian spectral invariants explicitly.
