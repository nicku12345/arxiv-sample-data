We establish a full h-principle (C^0-close, relative, parametric) for the simplification of singularities of Lagrangian and Legendrian fronts. More precisely, we prove that if there is no homotopy theoretic obstruction to simplifying the singularities of tangency of a Lagrangian or Legendrian submanifold with respect to an ambient foliation by Lagrangian or Legendrian leaves, then the simplification can be achieved by means of a Hamiltonian isotopy.
