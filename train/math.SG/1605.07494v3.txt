In this paper, via h-principle we prove that there exist contractible positive loops of Legendrian embeddings based at any loose Legendrian submanifold. As an application, we define a new partial order on \widetilde{Cont}_0(M,\xi) and prove that overtwisted contact manifolds are weakly non-orderable.
