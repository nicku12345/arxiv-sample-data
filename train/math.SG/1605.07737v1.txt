We show that every tight contact structure on any of the lens spaces L(ns^2-s+1,s^2) with n\geq 2, s\geq 1, can be obtained by a single Legendrian surgery along a suitable Legendrian realisation of the negative torus knot T(s,-(sn-1)) in the tight or an overtwisted contact structure on the 3-sphere.
