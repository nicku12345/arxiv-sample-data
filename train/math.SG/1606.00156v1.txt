Log-symplectic structures are Poisson structures \pi on X^{2n} for which \bigwedge^n \pi vanishes transversally. By viewing them as symplectic forms in a Lie algebroid, the b-tangent bundle, we use symplectic techniques to obtain existence results for log-symplectic structures on total spaces of fibration-like maps. More precisely, we introduce the notion of a b-hyperfibration and show that they give rise to log-symplectic structures. Moreover, we link log-symplectic structures to achiral Lefschetz fibrations and folded-symplectic structures.
