Let M be a symplectic manifold and G a connected, compact Lie group acting on M in a Hamiltonian way. In this paper, we study the equivariant cohomology of M represented by basic differential forms, and relate it to the cohomology of the Marsden-Weinstein reduced space via certain residue formulae using resolution of singularities and the stationary phase principle. In case that  M  is a compact, symplectic manifold or the co-tangent bundle of a G-manifold, similar residue formulae were derived by Jeffrey, Kirwan et al. for general equivariantly closed forms and by Ramacher for basic differential forms, respectively.
