Entov and Polterovich defined heaviness for closed subsets of a symplectic manifold by using the Hamiltonian Floer theory on contractible trajectories. Heavy subsets are known to be non-displaceable. In the present paper, we define a relative symplectic capacity C(M,X,R;e) for a symplectic manifold (M,\omega) and its subset X which measures the existence of non-contractible trajectories of Hamiltonian isotopies on the product with annulus. We prove that C(M,X,R;e) is finite if (M,\omega) is monotone and X is a heavy subset. We also prove that C(M,X,R;e) is infinite if X is a displaceable compact subset.
