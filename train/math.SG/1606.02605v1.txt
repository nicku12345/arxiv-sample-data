In this paper we study non-commutative integrable systems on b-Poisson manifolds. One important source of examples (and motivation) of such systems comes from considering non-commutative systems on manifolds with boundary having the right asymptotics on the boundary. In this paper we describe this and other examples and we prove an action-angle theorem for non-commutative integrable systems on a b-symplectic manifold in a neighbourhood of a Liouville torus inside the critical set of the Poisson structure associated to the b-symplectic structure.
