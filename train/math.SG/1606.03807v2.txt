We construct an embedding \Phi of [0,1]^{\infty} into Ham(M, \omega), the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a suitable closed symplectic manifold (M, \omega). We then prove that \Phi is in fact a quasi-isometry. After imposing further assumptions on (M, \omega), we adapt our methods to construct a similar embedding of \mathbb{R} \oplus [0,1]^{\infty} into either Ham(M, \omega) or \widetilde{Ham}(M, \omega), the universal cover of Ham(M, \omega). Along the way, we prove results related to the filtered Floer chain complexes of radially symmetric Hamiltonians. Our proofs rely heavily on a continuity result for barcodes (as presented in the work of M. Usher and J. Zhang) associated to filtered Floer homology viewed as a persistence module.
