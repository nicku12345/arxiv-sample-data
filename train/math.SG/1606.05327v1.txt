We consider Floer homology associated to a pair of closed Lagrangian submanifolds that satisfy a monotonicty assumption. If the Lagrangians intersect cleanly we decribe two spectral sequences which help to compute their Floer homology. The spectral sequences are constructed using a Morse-Bott version of Floer homology. We give a full treatment of the theory including orientations.
