Using the mirror theorem [CCIT15], we give a Landau-Ginzburg mirror description for the big equivariant quantum cohomology of toric Deligne-Mumford stacks. More precisely, we prove that the big equivariant quantum D-module of a toric Deligne-Mumford stack is isomorphic to the Saito structure associated to the mirror Landau-Ginzburg potential. We give a GKZ-style presentation of the quantum D-module, and a combinatorial description of quantum cohomology as a quantum Stanley-Reisner ring. We establish the convergence of the mirror isomorphism and of quantum cohomology in the big and equivariant setting.
