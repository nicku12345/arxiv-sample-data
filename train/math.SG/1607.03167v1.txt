For a Legendrian (2,n) torus knot or link with maximal Thurston-Bennequin number, Ekholm, Honda, and K\'alm\'an constructed C_n exact Lagrangian fillings, where C_n is the n-th Catalan number. We show that these exact Lagrangian fillings are pairwise non-isotopic through exact Lagrangian isotopy. To do that, we compute the augmentations induced by the exact Lagrangian fillings L to \mathbb{Z}_2[H_1(L)] and distinguish the resulting augmentations.
