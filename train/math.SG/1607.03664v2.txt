Presymplectic and Poisson reduction of cluster maps are described in terms of the "canonical" foliations of presymplectic and Poisson manifolds. This approach to reduction leads to a geometric description, in terms of foliations, of the dynamics of the original (not reduced) map. The case where multiple reductions exist (presymplectic/Poisson or presymplectic/Poisson/Poisson) is further explored and examples illustrating several features of this approach are presented, including a nontrivial one in dimension seven which is comprehensively treated.
