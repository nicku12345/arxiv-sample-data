A product of K\"ahler manifolds also carries a K\"ahler metric. In this short note we would like to study the product of generalized p-K\"ahler manifolds, compact or not. The results we get extend the known results (balanced, SKT, sG manifolds), and are optimal in the compact case. Hence we can give new non-trivial examples of generalized p-K\"ahler manifolds.
