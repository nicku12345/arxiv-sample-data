On small Seifert fibered spaces M(e_0;r_1,r_2,r_3) with e_0\neq-1,-2, all tight contact structures are Stein fillable. This is not the case for e_0=-1 or -2. However, for negative twisting structures it is expected that they are all symplectically fillable. Here, we characterize fillable structures among zero-twisting contact structures on small Seifert fibered spaces of the form M(-1;r_1,r_2,r_3). The result is obtained by analyzing monodromy factorizations of associated planar open books.
