Consider a sequence of compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms \phi_k of an exact symplectic manifold, all of which are "graphical" in the sense that their graphs are identified by a Darboux-Weinstein chart with the image of a one-form. We show by an elementary argument that if the \phi_k C^0-converge to the identity then their Calabi invariants converge to zero. This generalizes a result of Oh, in which the ambient manifold was the two-disk and an additional assumption was made on the Hamiltonians generating the \phi_k. We discuss connections to the open problem of whether the Calabi homomorphism extends to the Hamiltonian homeomorphism group. The proof is based on a relationship between the Calabi invariant of a C^0-small Hamiltonian diffeomorphism and the generalized phase function of its graph.
