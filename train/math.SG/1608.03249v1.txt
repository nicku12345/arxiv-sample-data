We construct a symplectic flow on a surface of genus g greater than one with exactly 2g-2 hyperbolic fixed points and no other periodic orbits. Moreover, we prove that a (strongly non-degenerate) symplectomorphism of a surface (with genus g greater than one) isotopic to the identity has infinitely many periodic points if there exists a fixed point with non-zero mean index. From this result, we obtain two corollaries, namely that such a symplectomorphism with an elliptic fixed point or with strictly more than 2g-2 fixed points has infinitely many periodic points provided that the flux of the isotopy is "irrational".
