Floer cohomology groups are usually defined over a field of formal functions (a Novikov field). Under certain assumptions, one can equip them with connections, which means operations of differentiation with respect to the Novikov variable. This allows one to write differential equations for Floer cohomology classes. Here, we apply that idea to symplectic cohomology groups associated to Lefschetz fibrations, and obtain a relation with enumerative geometry.
