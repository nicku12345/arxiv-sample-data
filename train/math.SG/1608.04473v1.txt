Given a punctured Riemann surface with a pair-of-pants decomposition, we compute its wrapped Fukaya category in a suitable model by reconstructing it from those of various pairs of pants. The pieces are glued together in the sense that the restrictions of the wrapped Floer complexes from two adjacent pairs of pants to their adjoining cylindrical piece agree. The A_\infty-structures are given by those in the pairs of pants. The category of singularities of the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model can also be constructed in the same way from local affine pieces that are mirrors of the pairs of pants.
