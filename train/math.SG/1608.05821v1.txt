Given an exact Lagrangian L of an exact symplectic manifold (M,d\lambda ), Cornea and Shelukhin recently introduced a remarkable "cobordism metric" d_c on the exact Lagrangian cobordism class \mathcal{L}(L) of L. In this note we show that the Liouville flow of (M,d\lambda ) induces a flow on (\mathcal{L}(L),d_c) which expands cobordism distances. In particular we deduce that (\mathcal{L}(L),d_c) has infinite diameter whenever the Liouville flow is complete. We also discuss (Hamiltonian and Lagrangian) Hofer-geometric versions of our result. The proof only uses elementary differential geometry.
