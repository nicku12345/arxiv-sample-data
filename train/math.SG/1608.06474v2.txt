Motivated by recent works on Hamiltonian circle actions satisfying certain minimal conditions, in this paper, we consider Hamiltonian circle actions satisfying an almost minimal condition. More precisely, we consider a compact symplectic manifold (M, \omega) admitting a Hamiltonian circle action with fixed point set consisting of two connected components X and Y satisfying \dim(X)+\dim(Y)=\dim(M). Under certain cohomology conditions, we determine the circle action, the integral cohomology rings of M, X and Y, and the total Chern classes of M, X, Y, and of the normal bundles of X and Y. The results show that these data are unique --- they are exactly the same as those in the standard example \Gt_2(\R^{2n+2}), the Grassmannian of oriented 2-planes in \R^{2n+2}, which is of dimension 4n with (any) n\in\N, equipped with a standard circle action. Moreover, if M is K\"ahler and the action is holomorphic, we can use a few different criteria to claim that M is S^1-equivariantly biholomorphic and S^1-equivariantly symplectomorphic to \Gt_2(\R^{2n+2}).
