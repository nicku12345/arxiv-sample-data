We count the number of holomorphic orbi-spheres in the \mathbb{Z}_2-quotient of an elliptic curve. We first prove that there is an explicit correspondence between the holomorphic orbi-spheres and the sublattices of \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \sqrt{-1} (\subset \mathbb{C}). The problem of counting sublattices of index d then reduces to find the number of integer solutions of the equation \alpha \delta - \beta \gamma = d up to an equivalence.
