The paper generalizes a result of Behrend-Fantechi and Baranovsky-Ginzburg to the 1-shifted cotangent bundle T^*X[1] of a smooth scheme X over the field of complex numbers. We show how one can obtain twisted cotangent bundles as derived intersections of Lagrangians in T^*X[1], moreover and we show that the derived intersection of the quantized Lagrangians coincide with the canonical quantization of the twisted cotangent bundles.
