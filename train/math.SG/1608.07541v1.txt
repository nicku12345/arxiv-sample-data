Let f be a polynomial over the complex numbers with an isolated singularity at 0. We show that the multiplicity and the log canonical threshold of f at 0 are invariants of the link of f viewed as a contact submanifold of the sphere.   This is done by first constructing a spectral sequence converging to the fixed point Floer cohomology of any iterate of the Milnor monodromy map whose E^1 page is explicitly described in terms of a log resolution of f. This spectral sequence is a generalization of a formula by A'Campo. By looking at this spectral sequence, we get a purely Floer theoretic description of the multiplicity and log canonical threshold of f.
