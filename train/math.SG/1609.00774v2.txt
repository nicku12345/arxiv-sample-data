Consider the Hamiltonian action of a compact connected Lie group on a transversely symplectic foliation which satisfies the transverse hard Lefschetz property. We establish an equivariant formality theorem and an equivariant symplectic d\delta-lemma in this setting. As an application, we show that if the foliation is also Riemannian, then there exists a natural formal Frobenius manifold structure on the equivariant basic cohomology of the foliation.
