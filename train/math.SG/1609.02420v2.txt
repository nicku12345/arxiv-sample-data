We construct two types of non-holomorphic Lefschetz fibrations over S^2 with (-1)-sections ---hence, they are fiber sum indecomposable--- by giving the corresponding positive relators. One type of the two does not satisfy the slope inequality (a necessary condition for a fibration to be holomorphic) and has a simply-connected total space, and the other has a total space that cannot admit any complex structure in the first place. These give an alternative existence proof for non-holomorphic Lefschetz pencils without Donaldson's theorem.
