We show that generalized broken fibrations in arbitrary dimensions admit rank-2 Poisson structures compatible with the fibration structure. After extending the notion of wrinkled fibration to dimension 6 we prove that these wrinkled fibrations also admit compatible rank-2 Poisson structures. In the cases with indefinite singularities we can provide these wrinkled fibrations in dimension 6 with near-symplectic structures.
