This paper meticulously revisit and study the flux geometry of any compact oriented manifold (M; W). We generalize several well-known factorization results, exhibit some orbital conditions for the study of flux geometry, give a proof of the discreteness of the flux group for volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, show that any smooth path in the kernel of the flux is a vanishing flux path, and show that the kernel of the flux for volume-preserving diffeomorphisms is C^1closed inside the group of all volume-preserving diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity map:This recovers several results from symplectic geometry. The fix-points theory does not resist to the above machinery: We prove a general contractibility result with respect to the orbits of the fix-points for volume-preserving diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity map via vanishing-flux paths, generalize and solve the Arnold conjecture using the Thurston fragmentation property. In the sequel, we use fix-points to: Characterize the flux geometry of certain C^0limits of sequences of vanishing-flux paths and volumepreserving diffeomorphisms. Beside this, a C^0criterion for the existence of at least one fix-point is given, and a weak version of the generalized C^0flux conjecture is solved. Finally, we construct a pseudo right-invariant metric on the group of all volume-preserving diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity map, prove several comparison results suitable to the study of the Hofer-like geometry of the group Ham(N; w), of all Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold (N; w), derive the equivalence between the Hofer and the Hofer-like metrics on Ham(N; w), and exhibit a computational proof of the non-degeneracy of the Hofer-like energies: Here, an outcome is that the Calabi group controls the Hofer-like geometry of the group Ham(N; w) of any closed symplectic manifold (N; w).
