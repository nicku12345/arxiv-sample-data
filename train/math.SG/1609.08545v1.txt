We establish an infinitesimal version of fragility for squared Dehn twists around even dimensional Lagrangian spheres. The precise formulation involves twisting the Fukaya category by a closed two-form or bulk deforming it by a half-dimensional cycle. As our main application, we compute the twisted and bulk deformed symplectic cohomology of the subflexible Weinstein manifolds constructed in \cite{murphysiegel}.
