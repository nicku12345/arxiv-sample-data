If there exists a set of canonical classes on a compact Hamiltonian-T-spaces in the sense of Goldin and Tolman, we derive some formulas for certain equivariant structure constants in terms of other equivariant structure constants and the values of canonical classes restricted to some fixed points. These formulas can be regarded as a generalization of Tymoczko's results.
