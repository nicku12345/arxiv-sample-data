The Arnold conjecture states that a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a closed and connected symplectic manifold must have at least as many fixed points as the minimal number of critical points of a smooth function on the manifold.   It is well known that the Arnold conjecture holds for Hamiltonian homeomorphisms of closed symplectic surfaces. The goal of this paper is to provide a counterexample to the Arnold conjecture for Hamiltonian homeomorphisms in dimensions four and higher.   More precisely, we prove that every closed and connected symplectic manifold of dimension at least four admits a Hamiltonian homeomorphism with a single fixed point.
