In this article we study immersions of the circle that are tangent to an Engel structure \mathcal{D}. We show that a full h-principle does exist as soon as one excludes the closed orbits of \mathcal{W}, the kernel of \mathcal{D}. This is sharp: we elaborate on work of Bryant and Hsu to show that curves tangent to \mathcal{W} often conform additional isolated components that cannot be detected at a formal level. We then show that this is an exceptional phenomenon: if \mathcal{D} is generic, curves tangent to \mathcal{W} are not isolated anymore.   We then go on to show that a full h-principle holds for immersions transverse to the Engel structure.
