In this paper we obtain new obstructions to symplectic embeddings of the four-dimensional polydisk P(a,1) into the ball B(c) for 2\leq a<\frac{\sqrt{7}-1} {\sqrt{7}-2} \approx 2.549, extending work done by Hind-Lisi and Hutchings. Schlenk's folding construction permits us to conclude our bound on c is optimal. Our proof makes use of the combinatorial criterion necessary for one "convex toric domain" to symplectically embed into another introduced by Hutchings in \cite{Beyond}. Additionally, we prove that if certain symplectic embeddings of four dimensional convex toric domains exist then a modified version of this criterion from \cite{Beyond} must hold, thereby reducing the computational complexity of the original criterion from O(2^n) to O(n^2).
