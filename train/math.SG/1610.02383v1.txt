We construct positive loops of Legendrian submanifolds in several instances. In particular, we partially recover G. Liu's result stating that any loose Legendrian admits a positive loop, under some mild topological assumptions on the Legendrian. Moreover, we show contractibility of the constructed loops under an extra topological assumption.
