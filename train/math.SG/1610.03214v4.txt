The nonequivariant coherent-costructible correspondence is a microlocal-geometric interpretation of homological mirror symmetry for toric varieties conjectured by Fang-Liu-Treumann-Zaslow. We prove a generalization of this conjecture for a class of toric stacks which includes any toric varieties and toric orbifolds. Our proof is based on gluing descriptions of \infty-categories of both sides.
