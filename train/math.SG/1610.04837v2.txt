We prove that all flexible Weinstein fillings of a given contact manifold with vanishing first Chern class have isomorphic integral cohomology; in certain cases, we prove that all flexible fillings are symplectomorphic. As an application, we show that in dimension at least 5 any almost contact class that has an almost Weinstein filling has infinitely many different contact structures. Similar methods are used to construct the first known infinite family of almost symplectomorphic Weinstein domains whose contact boundaries are not contactomorphic. We also prove relative analogs of our results, which we apply to Lagrangians in cotangent bundles.
