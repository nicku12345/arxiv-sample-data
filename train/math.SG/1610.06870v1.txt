We introduce the Kodaira dimension of contact 3-manifolds and establish some basic properties. In particular, contact 3-manifolds with distinct Kodaria dimensions behave differently when it comes to the geography of various kinds of fillings. On the other hand, we also prove that, given any contact 3-manifold, there is a lower bound of 2\chi+3\sigma for all its minimal symplectic fillings. This is motivated by the bound of Stipsicz for Stein fillings. Finally, we discuss various aspects of exact self cobordisms of fillable 3-manifolds.
