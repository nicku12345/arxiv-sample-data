We give a maximal set of disjoint (-1)-sections of the well-known Lefschetz fibration constructed by Matsumoto, Cadavid and Korkmaz. In fact, we obtain several such sets for a fixed genus, which implies that the Matsumoto-Cadavid-Korkmaz Lefschetz fibration has more than one supporting minimal Lefschetz pencils. We also determine the diffeomorphism types of the obtained supporting minimal Lefschetz pencils.
