We state a wall-crossing formula for the virtual classes of epsilon-stable quasimaps to GIT quotients and prove it for complete intersections in projective space, with no positivity restrictions on their first Chern class. As a consequence, the wall-crossing formula relating the genus g descendant Gromov-Witten potential and the genus g epsilon-quasimap descendant potential is established. For the quintic threefold, our results may be interpreted as giving a rigorous and geometric interpretation of the holomorphic limit of the BCOV B-model partition function of the mirror family.
