We recently defined invariants of contact 3-manifolds using a version of instanton Floer homology for sutured manifolds. In this paper, we prove that if several contact structures on a 3-manifold are induced by Stein structures on a single 4-manifold with distinct Chern classes modulo torsion then their contact invariants in sutured instanton homology are linearly independent. As a corollary, we show that if a 3-manifold bounds a Stein domain that is not an integer homology ball then its fundamental group admits a nontrivial homomorphism to SU(2). We give several new applications of these results, proving the existence of nontrivial and irreducible SU(2) representations for a variety of 3-manifold groups.
