Let (X,\omega) be a symplectic rational 4 manifold. We study the space of tamed almost complex structures \mathcal{J}_{\omega} using a fine decomposition via smooth rational curves and a relative version of the infinite-dimensional Alexander duality. This decomposition provides new understandings of both the variation and stability of the symplectomorphism group Symp(X,\omega) when deforming \omega. In particular, we compute the rank of \pi_1(Symp(X,\omega)) with Euler number \chi(X)\leq 7 in terms of the number N of -2 symplectic sphere classes.
