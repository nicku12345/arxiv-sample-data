We relate the brace construction introduced by Calaque and Willwacher to an additivity functor. That is, we construct a functor from brace algebras associated to an operad O to associative algebras in the category of homotopy O-algebras. As an example, we identify the category of P_{n+1}-algebras with the category of associative algebras in P_n-algebras. We also show that under this identification there is an equivalence of two definitions of derived coisotropic structures in the literature.
