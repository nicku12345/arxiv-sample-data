Let (M^4,\omega) be a geometrically bounded symplectic manifold, and L\subset M a Lagrangian nodal sphere such that \omega\mid_{\pi_2(M,L)}=0. We show that an equatorial Dehn twist of L does not extend to a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of M. We also confirm a mirror symmetry prediction about the action of a symplectomorphism extending an equatorial Dehn twist on the Floer theory of the nodal sphere. We present analogues of the equatorial Dehn twist for more singular Lagrangians, and make concrete conjectures about them.
