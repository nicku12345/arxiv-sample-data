This is the preliminary manuscript of a book on symplectic field theory based on a lecture course for PhD students given in 2015-16. It covers the essentials of the analytical theory of punctured pseudoholomorphic curves, taking the opportunity to fill in gaps in the existing literature where necessary, and then gives detailed explanations of a few of the standard applications in contact topology such as distinguishing contact structures up to contactomorphism and proving symplectic non-fillability.
