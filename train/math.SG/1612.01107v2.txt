Stefan M\ddot{\mathrm{u}}ller posed the problem "Do Hofer's metrics on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphism and the one of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms (Hameomorphisms) correspond?". Let (M,\omega) be a compact exact symplectic manifold. We prove that the group of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms is not a simple group if the positive answer of M\ddot{\mathrm{u}}ller's question holds . To prove this results, we introduce fragmented Hofer's norms on a normal subgroup of the group of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms.
