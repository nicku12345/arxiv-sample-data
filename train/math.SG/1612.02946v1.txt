We study obstructions to the existence of closed Fedosov's star products on a given K\"ahler manifold. In our previous paper, we proved that the Levi-Civita connection of a K\"ahler manifold will produce a closed (in the sense of Connes-Flato-Sternheimer) Fedosov's star product only if it is a zero of the Cahen-Gutt moment map on the space of symplectic connections. By analogy with the Futaki invariant obstructing the existence of cscK metrics, we build an obstruction for the existence of zero of the moment map and hence for the existence of closed Fedosov's star products on a K\"ahler manifold.
