We classify Legendrian unknots in overtwisted contact structures on S^3. In particular, we show that up to contact isotopy for every pair (n,\pm(n-1)) with n>0 there are exactly two oriented non-loose Legendrian unknots in S^3 with Thurston-Bennequin invariant n and rotation number \pm(n-1). (Only one overtwisted contact structure on S^3 admits a non-loose unknot K and the classical invariants have to be \mathrm{tb}(K)=n and \mathrm{rot}(K)=\pm(n-1) for n>1.)   This can be used to prove two results attributed to Y.~Che\-kan\-ov: The first implies that the contact mapping class group of an overtwisted contact structure on S^3 depends on the contact structure. The second result is that the identity component of the contactomorphism group of an overtwisted contact structure on S^3 does not always act transitively on the set of boundaries of overtwisted discs.
