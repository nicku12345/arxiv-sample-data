We consider two disjoint and homotopic non-contractible embedded loops on a Riemann surface and prove the existence of a non-contractible orbit for a Hamiltonian function on the surface whenever it is sufficiently large on one of the loops and sufficiently small on the other one. This gives the first example of an estimate from above for a generalized form of the Biran-Polterovich-Salamon capacity for a closed symplectic manifold.
