Let A be a central quantization of an affine Poisson variety X over a field of characteristic p>0. We show that the completion of A with respect to a closed point y\in X is isomorphic to the tensor product of the Weyl algebra with a local Poisson algebra. This result can be thought of as a positive characteristic analogue of results of Losev and Kaledin about slice algebras of quantizations in characteristic 0.
