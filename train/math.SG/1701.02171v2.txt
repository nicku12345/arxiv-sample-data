In the mapping class group of a k-holed torus with 0 \leq k \leq 9, one can factorize the boundary multi-twist (or the identity when k=0) as the product of twelve right-handed Dehn twists. Such factorizations were explicitly given by Korkmaz and Ozbagci for each k \leq 9 and an alternative one for k=8 by Tanaka. In this note, we simplify their expressions for the k-holed torus relations.
