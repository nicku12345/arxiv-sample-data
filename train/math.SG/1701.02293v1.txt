In this note we present a brief introduction to Lagrangian Floer homology and its relation with the solution of Arnol'd conjecture, on the minimal number of non-degenerate fixed points of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism. We start with the basic definition of critical point on smooth manifolds, in oder to sketch some aspects of Morse theory. Introduction to the basics concepts of symplectic geometry are also included, with the idea of understanding the statement of Arnol'd Conjecture and how is related to the intersection of Lagrangian submanifolds.
