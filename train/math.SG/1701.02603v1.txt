We consider a hyperk\"ahler reduction and describe it via frame bundles. Tracing the connection through the various reductions, we recover the results of Gocho and Nakajima. In addition, we show that the fibers of such a reduction are necessarily totally geodesic. As an independent result, we describe O'Neill's submersion tensors on principal bundles.
