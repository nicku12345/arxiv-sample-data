We give several equivalent characterizations of orthogonal subbundles of the generalized tangent bundle defined, up to B-field transform, by almost product and local product structures. We also introduce a pure spinor formalism for generalized CRF-structure and investigate the resulting decomposition of the de Rham operator. As applications we give a characterization of generalized complex manifolds that are locally the product of generalized complex factors and discuss infinitesimal deformations of generalized CRF-structures.
