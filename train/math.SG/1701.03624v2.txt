We extend Floer theory for monotone Lagrangians to allow coefficients in local systems of arbitrary rank. Unlike the rank 1 case, this is often obstructed by Maslov 2 discs. We study exactly what the obstruction is and define some natural unobstructed subcomplexes. To illustrate these constructions we do some explicit calculations for the Chiang Lagrangian L_{\Delta} \subseteq \mathbb{C}P^3. For example, we equip L_{\Delta} with a particular rank 2 local system W over the field with 2 elements such that the resulting Floer complex CF^*(W,W) is unobstructed despite the presence of Maslov 2 discs. We compute that the cohomology HF^*(W,W) is non-zero and deduce that the Chiang Lagrangian cannot be disjoined from \mathbb{R}P^3 by a Hamiltonian isotopy.
