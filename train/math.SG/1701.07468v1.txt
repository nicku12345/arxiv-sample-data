In this paper, we study the algebraic symplectic geometry of the singular moduli spaces of Higgs bundles of degree 0 and rank n on a compact Riemann surface X of genus g. In particular, we prove that such moduli spaces are symplectic singularities, in the sense of Beauville [Bea00], and admit a projective symplectic resolution if and only if g=1 or (g, n)=(2,2). These results are an application of a recent paper by Bellamy and Schedler [BS16] via the so-called Isosingularity Theorem.
