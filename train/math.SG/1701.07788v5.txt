We consider symplectic fibrations as in Guillemin-Lerman-Sternberg, and derive a spectral sequence to compute the Floer cohomology of certain fibered Lagrangians sitting inside a compact symplectic fibration with small monotone fibers and a rational base. We show if the Floer cohomology with field coefficients of the fiber Lagrangian vanishes, then the Floer cohomology with field coefficients of the total Lagrangian also vanishes. We give an application to certain non-torus fibers of the Gelfand-Cetlin system in Flag manifolds, and show that their Floer cohomology vanishes.
