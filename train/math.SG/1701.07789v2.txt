A categorical formalism is introduced for studying various features of the symplectic geometry of Lefschetz fibrations and the algebraic geometry of Tyurin degenerations. This approach is informed by homological mirror symmetry, derived noncommutative geometry, and the theory of Fukaya categories with coefficients in a perverse Schober. The main technical results include (i) a comparison between the notion of relative Calabi-Yau structures and a certain refinement of the notion of a spherical functor, (ii) a local-to-global gluing principle for constructing Calabi-Yau structures, and (iii) the construction of shifted symplectic structures and Lagrangian structures on certain derived moduli spaces of branes. Potential applications to a theory of derived hyperk\"ahler geometry are sketched.
