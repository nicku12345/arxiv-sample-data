In this expository manuscript, we review the construction of Gromov-Witten virtual fundamental class via FOOO's theory of Kuranishi structures for moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic maps defined on closed Riemann surfaces. We consider constraints coming from the ambient space and Deligne-Mumford moduli, called primary insertions, as well as intrinsic classes such as \psi-classes and Hodge classes.
