Consider a 2n-dimensional symplectic vector space E over an arbitrary field \mathbb{F}. Given a contraction map f: \wedge^n E \rightarrow \wedge^{n-2} E such that the Lagrangian--Grassmannian L(n,2n)=G(n,2n)\cap{\mathbb P}(\ker f), where \wedge^r E denotes the r-th exterior power of E and {\mathbb P}(\ker f) is the projectivization of \ker f. In this paper, for a symplectic vector space E of dimension n=6, we prove that the surjectivity of the contraction map f:\wedge^{6} E \rightarrow \wedge^{4} E depends on the characteristic of the base field and we calculate the codimension of the linear section {\mathbb P}(\ker f)\subseteq {\mathbb P}(\wedge^{6}E) for any characteristic.
