In this article we extend the construction of the Floer fundamental group to the monotone Lagrangian setting and use it to study the fundamental group of a Lagrangian cobordism W\subset (\mathbb{C}\times M, \omega_{st}\oplus\omega) between two Lagrangian submanifolds L, L'\subset ( M, \omega). We show that under natural conditions the inclusions L,L'\hookrightarrow W induce surjective maps \pi_{1}(L)\twoheadrightarrow\pi_{1}(W), \pi_{1}(L')\twoheadrightarrow\pi_{1}(W) and when the previous maps are injective then W is an h-cobordism.
