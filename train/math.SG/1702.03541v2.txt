We connect Poisson and near-symplectic geometry by showing that there is an almost regular Poisson structure induced by a near-symplectic form \omega when its singular locus is a symplectic mapping torus. This condition is automatically satisfied on any near-symplectic 4-manifold. The Poisson structure \pi is of maximal rank 2n and it drops its rank by 4 on a degeneracy set that coincides with the singular locus of the near-symplectic form. We then compute its Poisson cohomology in dimension 4. The cohomology spaces are finite dimensional and depend on the modular class. We conclude with a comment on the interaction between the Poisson structure \pi and an overtwisted contact structure.
