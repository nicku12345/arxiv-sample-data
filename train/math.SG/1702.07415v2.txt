We study Legendrian embeddings of a compact Legendrian submanifold L sitting in a closed contact manifold (M,\xi) whose contact structure is supported by a (contact) open book \mathcal{OB} on M. We prove that if \mathcal{OB} has Weinstein pages, then there exist a contact structure \xi' on M, isotopic to \xi and supported by \mathcal{OB}, and a contactomorphism f:(M,\xi) \to (M,\xi') such that the image f(L) of any such submanifold can be Legendrian isotoped so that it becomes disjoint from the closure of a page of \mathcal{OB}.
