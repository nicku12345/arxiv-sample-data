We prove that the open Gromov-Witten invariants on K3 surfaces satisfy the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula. One one hand, this gives a geometric interpretation of the slab functions in Gross-Siebert program. On the other hands, the open Gromov-Witten invariants coincide with the weighted counting of tropical discs. This is an analog of the corresponding theorem on toric varieties \cite{M2}\cite{NS} but on compact Calabi-Yau surfaces.
