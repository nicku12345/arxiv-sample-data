Let (\Sigma,\tau) denote a Riemann surface of genus g \geq 2 equipped with an anti-holomorphic involution \tau. In this paper we study the topology of the moduli space M(r,\xi)^\tau of stable Real vector bundles over (\Sigma,\tau) of rank r and fixed determinant \xi of degree coprime to r.   We prove that M(r,\xi)^{\tau} is an orientable and monotone Lagrangian submanifold of the complex moduli space M(r,\xi) so it determines an object in the appropriate Fukaya category. We derive recursive formulas for the mod 2 Betti numbers of M(r,\xi)^\tau and compute mod p Betti numbers for odd p through a range of degrees. We deduce that if r is even and  g >>0, then M(r,\xi)^{\tau} and M(r,\xi')^{\tau} have non-isomorphic cohomology groups unless \xi and \xi' have equivalent Stieffel-Whitney classes modulo automorphisms of (\Sigma,\tau). If r is even, and g>>0 is even, we prove that the Betti numbers of M(r,\xi)^{\tau} distinguish topological types of (\Sigma, \tau; \xi). If r=2 and g is odd, we compute all mod p Betti numbers of M(2,\xi)^\tau.   MR 32L05, 14P25.
