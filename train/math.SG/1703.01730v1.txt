The first author introduced a relative symplectic capacity C for a symplectic manifold (N,\omega_N) and its subset X which measures the existence of non-contractible periodic trajectories of Hamiltonian isotopies on the product of N with the annulus A_R=(R,R)\times\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}. In the present paper, we give an exact computation of the capacity C of the 2n-torus \mathbb{T}^{2n} relative to a Lagrangian submanifold \mathbb{T}^n which implies the existence of non-contractible Hamiltonian periodic trajectories on A_R\times\mathbb{T}^{2n}. Moreover, we give a lower bound on the number of such trajectories.
