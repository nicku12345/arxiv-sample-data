A generalized complex structure is called stable if its defining anticanonical section vanishes transversally, on a codimension-two submanifold. Alternatively, it is a zero elliptic residue symplectic structure in the elliptic tangent bundle associated to this submanifold. We develop Gompf-Thurston symplectic techniques adapted to Lie algebroids, and use these to construct stable generalized complex structures out of log-symplectic structures. In particular we introduce the notion of a boundary Lefschetz fibration for this purpose and describe how they can be obtained from genus one Lefschetz fibrations over the disk.
