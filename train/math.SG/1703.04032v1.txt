We study Lagrangian correspondences between Liouville manifolds and construct functors between wrapped Fukaya categories. The study naturally brings up the question on comparing two versions of wrapped Fukaya categories of the product manifold, which we prove quasi-isomorphism on the level of wrapped Floer cohomology. To prove representability of these functors constructed from Lagrangian correspondences, we introduce the geometric compositions of Lagrangian correspondences under wrapping, as new classes of objects in the wrapped Fukaya category, which we prove to represent the functors by establishing a canonical isomorphism of quilted version of wrapped Floer cohomology under geometric composition.
