We give a direct, explicit and self-contained construction of a local Lie groupoid integrating a given Lie algebroid which only depends on the choice of a spray vector field lifting the underlying anchor map. This construction leads to a complete account of local Lie theory and, in particular, to a finite-dimensional proof of the fact that the category of germs of local Lie groupoids is equivalent to that of Lie algebroids.
