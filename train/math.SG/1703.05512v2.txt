We study the Morse-Novikov cohomology and its almost-symplectic counterpart on manifolds admitting locally conformally symplectic structures. More precisely, we introduce lcs cohomologies and we study elliptic Hodge theory, dualities, Hard Lefschetz Condition. We consider solvmanifolds and Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds. In particular, we prove that Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds with precisely one complex place, and under an additional arithmetic condition, satisfy the Mostow property. This holds in particular for the Inoue surface of type S^0.
