We inquire into the relation between the curl operators, the Poisson coboundary operators and contravariant derivatives on Poisson manifolds to study the theory of differential operators in Poisson geometry. Given an oriented Poisson manifold, we describe locally those two differential operators in terms of Poisson connection whose torsion is vanishing. Moreover, we introduce the notion of the modular operator for an oriented Poisson manifold. For a symplectic manifold, we describe explicitly the modular operator in terms of the curvature 2-section of Poisson connection, analogously to the Weitzenb\ddot{\rm o}ck formula in Riemannian geometry.
