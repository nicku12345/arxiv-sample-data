We study the generalization of quasipositive links from the three-sphere to arbitrary closed, orientable three-manifolds. Our main result shows that the boundary of any smooth, properly embedded complex curve in a Stein domain is a quasipositive link. This generalizes a result due to Boileau and Orevkov, and it provides the first half of a topological characterization of links in three-manifolds which bound complex curves in a Stein filling. Our arguments replace pseudoholomorphic curve techniques with a study of characteristic and open book foliations on surfaces in three- and four-manifolds.
