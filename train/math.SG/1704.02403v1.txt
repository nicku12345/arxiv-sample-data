A new relation between homoclinic points and Lagrangian Floer homology is presented: In dimension two, we construct a Floer homology generated by primary homoclinic points. We compute two examples and prove an invariance theorem. Moreover, we establish a link to the (absolute) flux and growth of symplectomorphisms.
