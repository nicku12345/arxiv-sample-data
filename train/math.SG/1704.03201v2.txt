We extend results about n-shifted coisotropic structures from part I of this work to the setting of derived Artin stacks. We show that an intersection of coisotropic morphisms carries a Poisson structure of shift one less. We also compare non-degenerate shifted coisotropic structures and shifted Lagrangian structures and show that there is a natural equivalence between the two spaces in agreement with the classical result. Finally, we define quantizations of n-shifted coisotropic structures and show that they exist for n>1.
