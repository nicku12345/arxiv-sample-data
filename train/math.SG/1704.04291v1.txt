Let L be an exact Lagrangian submanifold of a cotangent bundle T^* M, asymptotic to a Legendrian submanifold \Lambda \subset T^{\infty} M. We study a locally constant sheaf of \infty-categories on L, called the sheaf of brane structures or \mathrm{Brane}_L. Its fiber is the \infty-category of spectra, and we construct a Hamiltonian invariant, fully faithful functor from \Gamma(L,\mathrm{Brane}_L) to the \infty-category of sheaves of spectra on M with singular support in \Lambda.
