This note is devoted to the study of the homology class of a compact Poisson transversal in a Poisson manifold. For specific classes of Poisson structures, such as unimodular Poisson structures and Poisson manifolds with closed leaves, we prove that all their compact Poisson transversals represent non-trivial homology classes, generalizing the symplectic case. We discuss several examples in which this property does not hold, as well as a weaker version of this property, which holds for log-symplectic structures. Finally, we extend our results to Dirac geometry.
