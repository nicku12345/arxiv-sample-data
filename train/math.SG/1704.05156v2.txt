Let \Lambda be a Legendrian submanifold of the 1-jet space of a smooth manifold. Associated to \Lambda there is a Legendrian invariant called Legendrian contact homology, which is defined by counting rigid pseudo-holomorphic disks of \Lambda. Moreover, there exists a bijective correspondence between rigid pseudo-holomorphic disks and rigid Morse flow trees of \Lambda, which allows us to compute the Legendrian contact homology of \Lambda via Morse theory.   If \Lambda is spin, then the moduli space of the rigid disks can be given a coherent orientation, so that the Legendrian contact homology of \Lambda can be defined with coefficients in \mathbb Z. In this paper we give an explicit algorithm for computing the corresponding orientation of the moduli space of rigid Morse flow trees, using the Morse theoretical framework.
