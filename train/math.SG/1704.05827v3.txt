Givental's non-linear Maslov index, constructed in 1990, is a quasimorphism on the universal cover of the identity component of the contactomorphism group of real projective space. This invariant was used by several authors to prove contact rigidity phenomena such as orderability, unboundedness of the discriminant and oscillation metrics, and a contact geometric version of the Arnold conjecture. In this article we give an analogue for lens spaces of Givental's construction and its applications.
