Motivated by the study of Nishinou-Nohara-Ueda on the Floer thoery of Gelfand-Cetlin systems over complex partial flag manifolds, we provide a complete description of the topology of Gelfand-Cetlin fibers. We prove that all fibers are \emph{smooth} isotropic submanifolds and give a complete description of the fiber to be Lagrangian in terms of combinatorics of Gelfand-Cetlin polytope. Then we study (non-)displaceability of Lagrangian fibers. After a few combinatorial and numercal tests for the displaceability, using the bulk-deformation of Floer cohomology by Schubert cycles, we prove that every full flag manifold \mathcal{F}(n) (n \geq 3) with a monotone Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form carries a continuum of non-displaceable Lagrangian tori which degenerates to a non-torus fiber in the Hausdorff limit. In particular, the Lagrangian S^3-fiber in \mathcal{F}(3) is non-displaceable the question of which was raised by Nohara-Ueda who computed its Floer cohomology to be vanishing.
