A hypersymplectic structure on a 4-manifold X is a triple \underline{\omega} of symplectic forms which at every point span a maximal positive-definite subspace of \Lambda^2 for the wedge product. This article is motivated by a conjecture of Donaldson: when X is compact \underline{\omega} can be deformed through cohomologous hypersymplectic structures to a hyperk\"ahler triple. We approach this via a link with G_2-geometry. A hypersymplectic structure \underline\omega on a compact manifold X defines a natural G_2-structure \phi on X \times \mathbb{T}^3 which has vanishing torsion precisely when \underline{\omega} is a hyperk\"ahler triple. We study the G_2-Laplacian flow starting from \phi, which we interpret as a flow of hypersymplectic structures. Our main result is that the flow extends as long as the scalar curvature of the corresponding G_2-structure remains bounded. An application of our result is a lower bound for the maximal existence time of the flow, in terms of weak bounds on the initial data (and with no assumption that scalar curvature is bounded along the flow).
