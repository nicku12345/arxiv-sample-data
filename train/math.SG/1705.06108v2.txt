In the setting of symplectic manifolds which are convex at infinity, we use a version of the Aleksandrov maximum principle to derive uniform estimates for Floer solutions that are valid for a wider class of Hamiltonians and almost complex structures than is usually considered. This allows us to extend the class of Hamiltonians which one can use in the direct limit when constructing symplectic homology. As an application, we detect elements of infinite order in the symplectic mapping class group of a Liouville domain, and obtain existence results for translated points.
