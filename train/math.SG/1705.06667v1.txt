Given an algebraic hypersurface H=f^{-1}(0) in (\mathbb{C}^*)^n, homological mirror symmetry relates the wrapped Fukaya category of H to the derived category of singularities of the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model. We propose an enriched version of this picture which also features the wrapped Fukaya category of the complement (\mathbb{C}^*)^n\setminus H and the Fukaya-Seidel category of the Landau-Ginzburg model ((\mathbb{C}^*)^n,f). We illustrate our speculations on simple examples, and sketch a proof of homological mirror symmetry for higher-dimensional pairs of pants.
