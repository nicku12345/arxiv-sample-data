Given an open book decomposition of a contact three man-ifold (M, \xi) with pseudo-Anosov monodromy and fractional Dehn twist coefficient c = k n, we construct a Legendrian knot \Lambda close to the stable foliation of a page, together with a small Legendrian pushoff \Lambda. When k \ge 5, we apply the techniques of [CH2] to show that the strip Legen-drian contact homology of \Lambda \rightarrow \Lambda is well-defined and has an exponential growth property. The work [Al2] then implies that all Reeb vector fields for \xi have positive topological entropy.
