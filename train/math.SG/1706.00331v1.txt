These notes present a systematic treatment of local properties of J-holomorphic maps and of Gromov's convergence for sequences of such maps, specifying the assumptions needed for all statements. In particular, only one auxiliary statement depends on the manifold being symplectic. The content of these notes roughly corresponds to Chapters 2 and 4 of McDuff-Salamon's book on the subject.
