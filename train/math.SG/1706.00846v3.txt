Given two Fuchsian representations \rho_l and \rho_r of the fundamental group of a closed oriented surface S of genus \geq 2, we study the relation between Lagrangian submanifolds of M_\rho=(\mathbb{H}^2/\rho_l(\pi_1(S)))\times (\mathbb{H}^2/\rho_r(\pi_1(S))) and \rho-equivariant embeddings \sigma of \widetilde S into Anti-de Sitter space, where \rho=(\rho_l,\rho_r) is the corresponding representation into \mathrm{PSL}_2\mathbb R\times \mathrm{PSL}_2\mathbb R. It is known that, if \sigma is a maximal embedding, then its Gauss map takes values in the unique minimal Lagrangian submanifold \Lambda_{\mathrm{ML}} of M_\rho.   We show that, given any \rho-equivariant embedding \sigma, its Gauss map gives a Lagrangian submanifold Hamiltonian isotopic to \Lambda_{\mathrm{ML}}. Conversely, any Lagrangian submanifold Hamiltonian isotopic to \Lambda_{\mathrm{ML}} is associated to some equivariant embedding into the future unit tangent bundle of the universal cover of Anti-de Sitter space.
