In this paper we construct a 2-functor from the unobstructed immersed Weinstein category to the category of all filtered A infinity categories. We consider arbitrary (compact) symplectic manifolds and its arbitrary (relatively spin) immersed Lagrangian submanifolds. The filtered A infinity category associated to a symplectic manifold is defined by using Lagrangian Floer theory in such generality by Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono and Akaho-Joyce. The morphism of unobstructed immersed Weinstein category is by definition a pair of immersed Lagrangian submanifold of the direct product and its bounding cochain (in the sense of Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono and Akaho-Joyce). Such a morphism transforms an (immersed) Lagrangian submanifold of one factor to one of the other factor. The key new result proved in this paper shows that this geometric transformation preserves unobstructed-ness of the Lagrangian Floer theory. Thus, this paper generalizes earlier results by Wehrheim-Woodward and Mau's-Wehrheim-Woodward so that it works in complete generality in the compact case. The main idea of the proofs are based on Lekili-Lipiyansky's Y diagram and a lemma from homological algebra, together with systematic use of Yoneda functor. In other words the proofs are based on a different idea from those which are studied by Bottmann-Mau's-Wehrheim-Woodward, where strip shrinking and figure 8 bubble plays the central role.
