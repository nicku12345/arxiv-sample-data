We study the mirror operation of the Atiyah flop in symplectic geometry. We formulate the operation for a symplectic manifold with a Lagrangian fibration. Furthermore we construct geometric stability conditions on the derived Fukaya category of the deformed conifold and study the action of the mirror Atiyah flop on these stability conditions.
