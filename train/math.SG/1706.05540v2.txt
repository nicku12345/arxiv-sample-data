This is a revision of some expository lecture notes written originally for a 5-hour minicourse on the intersection theory of punctured holomorphic curves and its applications in 3-dimensional contact topology. The main lectures are aimed primarily at students and require only a minimal background in holomorphic curve theory, as the emphasis is on topological rather than analytical issues. Some of the gaps in the analysis are then filled in by the appendices, which include self-contained proofs of the similarity principle and positivity of intersections, and conclude with a "quick reference" for the benefit of researchers, detailing the basic facts of Siefring's intersection theory.
