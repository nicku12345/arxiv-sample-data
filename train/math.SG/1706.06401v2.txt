Homogeneous compatible almost complex structures on symplectic manifolds are studied, focusing on those which are special, meaning that their Chern-Ricci form is a multiple of the symplectic form. Non Chern-Ricci flat ones are proven to be covered by co-adjoint orbits. Conversely, compact isotropy co-adjoint orbits of semi-simple Lie groups are shown to admit special compatible almost complex structures whenever they satisfy a necessary topological condition. Some classes of examples including twistor spaces of hyperbolic manifolds and discrete quotients of Griffiths period domains of weight two are discussed.
