In this article we investigate the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem using the theory of hyperfunctions. In applications involving Hamiltonian torus actions on infinite dimensional manifolds, this more general theory seems to be necessary in order to accomodate the existence of the infinite order differential operators which arise from the isotropy representations on the tangent spaces to fixed points. We will quickly review of the theory of hyperfunctions and their Fourier transforms. We will then apply this theory to construct a hyperfunction analogue of the Duistermaat-Heckman distribution. Our main goal will be to study the Duistermaat-Heckman hyperfunction of \Omega SU(2), but in getting to this goal we will also characterize the singular locus of the moment map for the Hamiltonian action of T\times S^1 on \Omega G. The main goal of this paper is to present a Duistermaat-Heckman hyperfunction arising from a Hamiltonian action on an infinite dimensional manifold.
