Let LG be the loop group of a compact, connected Lie group G. We show that the tangent bundle of any proper Hamiltonian LG-space \mathcal{M} has a natural completion \overline{T}\mathcal{M} to a strongly symplectic LG-equivariant vector bundle. This bundle admits an invariant compatible complex structure within a natural polarization class, defining an LG-equivariant spinor bundle \mathsf{S}_{\overline{T}\mathcal{M}}, which one may regard as the Spin_c-structure of \mathcal{M}. We describe two procedures for obtaining a finite-dimensional version of this spinor module. In one approach, we construct from \mathsf{S}_{\overline{T}\mathcal{M}} a twisted Spin_c-structure for the quasi-Hamiltonian G-space associated to \mathcal{M}. In the second approach, we describe an `abelianization procedure', passing to a finite-dimensional T\subset LG-invariant submanifold of \mathcal{M}, and we show how to construct an equivariant Spin_c-structure on that submanifold.
