We introduce and study the derived moduli stack \mathrm{Symp}(X,n) of n-shifted symplectic structures on a given derived stack X, as introduced by [PTVV] (IHES Vol. 117, 2013). In particular, under reasonable assumptions on X, we prove that \mathrm{Symp}(X, n) carries a canonical shifted quadratic form. This generalizes a classical result of Fricke and Habermann, which was established in the C^{\infty}-setting, to the broader context of derived algebraic geometry, thus proving a conjecture stated by Vezzosi.
