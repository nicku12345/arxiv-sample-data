From a view point of the moment map, we shall introduce the notion of Einstein-Hermitian generalized connections over a generalized K\"ahler manifold of symplectic type.   We show that moduli spaces of Einstein-Hermitian generalized connections arise as the K\"ahler quotients. The deformation complex of Einstein-Hermitian generalized connections is an elliptic complex and it turns out that the smooth part of the moduli space is a finite dimensional K\"ahler manifold. The canonical line bundle over a generalized K\"ahler manifold of symplectic type has the canonical generalized connection and its curvature coincides with "the scalar curvature as the moment map" which is defined in the previous paper [Goto_2016]. K\"ahler-Ricci solitons provide examples of Einstein-Hermitian generalized connections and Einstein Hermitian co-Higgs bundles are also discussed.
