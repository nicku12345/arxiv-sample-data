Consider a space X, such as a compact space of J-holomorphic stable maps, that is the zero set of a Kuranishi atlas. This note explains how to define the virtual fundamental class of X by representing X via the zero set of a map S_M: M\to E, where E is a finite dimensional vector space and the domain M is an oriented, weighted branched topological manifold. Moreover, S_M is equivariant under the action of the global isotropy group \Gamma on M and E. This tuple (M,E, \Gamma, S_M) together with a homeomorphism S_M^{-1}(0)/\Gamma \to X forms a single finite dimensional model (or chart) for X. The construction assumes only that the atlas satisfies a topological version of the index condition that can be obtained from a standard, rather than a smooth, gluing theorem. However if X is presented as the zero set of an sc-Fredholm operator on a strong polyfold bundle, we outline a much more direct construction of the branched manifold M that uses an sc-smooth partition of unity.
