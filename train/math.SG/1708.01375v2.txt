Let G be any connected and simply connected complex semisimple Lie group, equipped with a standard holomorphic multiplicative Poisson structure. We show that the Hamiltonian flows of all the Fomin-Zelevinsky twisted generalized minors on every double Bruhat cell of G are complete in the sense that all the integral curves of their Hamiltonian vector fields are defined on {\mathbb{C}}. It follows that all the Kogan-Zelevinsky integrable systems on G have complete Hamiltonian flows, generalizing the result of Gekhtman and Yakimov for the case of SL(n, {\mathbb{C}}). We in fact construct a class of integrable systems with complete Hamiltonian flows associated to {\it generalized Bruhat cells} which are defined using arbitrary sequences of elements in the Weyl group of G, and we obtain the results for double Bruhat cells through the so-called open {\it Fomin-Zelevinsky embeddings} of (reduced) double Bruhat cells in generalized Bruhat cells. The Fomin-Zelevinsky embeddings are proved to be Poisson, and they provide global coordinates on double Bruhat cells, called {\it Bott-Samelson coordinates}, in which all the Fomin-Zelevinsky minors become polynomials and the Poisson structure can be computed explicitly.
