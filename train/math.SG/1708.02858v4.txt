We introduce the notion of asymptotically finitely generated contact structures, which states essentially that the Symplectic Homology in a certain degree of any filling of such contact manifolds is uniformly generated by only finitely many Reeb orbits. This property is used to generalize a famous result by Ustilovsky: We show that in a large class of manifolds (including all unit cotangent bundles and all Weinstein fillable contact manifolds with torsion first Chern class) each carries infinitely many exactly fillable contact structures. These are all different from the ones constructed recently by Lazarev. Along the way, the construction of Symplectic Homology is made more general. Moreover, we give a detailed exposition of Cieliebak's Invariance Theorem for subcritical handle attaching, where we provide explicit Hamiltonians for the squeezing on the handle.
