A class of partially wrapped Fukaya categories in T^* N are proven to be well defined and then studied. In the case of N diffeomorphic to \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{T}^n, it is shown that these categories provide homological mirrors to equivariant and non-equivariant categories of coherent sheaves on toric varieties. This gives a new Floer theoretic formulation of mirror symmetry in the non-complete case.
