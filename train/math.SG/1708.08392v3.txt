We determine three invariants: Arnold's J^+-invariant as well as \mathcal{J}_1 and \mathcal{J}_2 invariants, which were introduced by Cieliebak-Frauenfelder-van Koert, of periodic orbits of the second kind near the heavier primary in the restricted three-body problem, provided that the mass ratio is sufficiently small.
