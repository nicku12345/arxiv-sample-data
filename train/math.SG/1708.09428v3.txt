We associate to each symplectic 4-orbifold X a canonical smooth symplectic resolution \pi: \tilde{X}\rightarrow X, which can be done equivariantly if X comes with a symplectic G-action by a finite group. Moreover, we show that the resolutions of the symplectic 4-orbifolds X/G and \tilde{X}/G are in the same symplectic birational equivalence class; in fact, the resolution of \tilde{X}/G can be reduced to that of X/G by successively blowing down symplectic (-1)-spheres.   To any finite symplectic G-action on a 4-manifold M, we associate a pair (M_G,D), where \pi: M_G\rightarrow M/G is the canonical resolution of the quotient orbifold and D is the pre-image of the singular set of M/G under \pi. We propose to study the group action on M by analyzing the smooth or symplectic topology of M_G as well as the embedding of D in M_G. In this paper, an investigation on the symplectic Kodaira dimension \kappa^s of M_G is initiated. In particular, we conjecture that \kappa^s(M_G)\leq \kappa^s(M). The inequality is verified for several classes of symplectic G-actions, including any actions on a rational surface or a symplectic 4-manifold with \kappa^s=0.
