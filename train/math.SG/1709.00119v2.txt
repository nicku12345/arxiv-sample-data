For any r\geq 1 and \mathbf{n} \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}^r \setminus \{\mathbf0\} we construct a poset W_{\mathbf{n}} called a 2-associahedron. The 2-associahedra arose in symplectic geometry, where they are expected to control maps between Fukaya categories of different symplectic manifolds. We prove that the completion \widehat{W_{\mathbf{n}}} is an abstract polytope of dimension |\mathbf{n}|+r-3. There are forgetful maps W_{\mathbf{n}} \to K_r, where K_r is the (r-2)-dimensional associahedron, and the 2-associahedra specialize to the associahedra (in two ways) and to the multiplihedra. In an appendix, we work out the 2- and 3-dimensional associahedra in detail.
