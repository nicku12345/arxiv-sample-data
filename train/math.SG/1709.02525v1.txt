We consider compatibility conditions between Poisson and Riemannian structures on smooth manifolds by means of a contravariant partially complex structure, or f-structure, introducing the notion of (almost) K\"ahler--Poisson manifolds. In addition, we study some of their properties under structure preserving maps and symmetries.
