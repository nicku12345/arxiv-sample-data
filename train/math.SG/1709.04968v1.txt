Let T^m_f  be the Toeplitz quantization of a real  C^{\infty} function defined on the sphere  \mathbb{CP}(1). T^m_f  is therefore a Hermitian matrix with spectrum \lambda^m= (\lambda_0^m,\ldots,\lambda_m^m). Schur's theorem says that the diagonal of a Hermitian matrix A that has the same spectrum of  T^m_f  lies inside a finite dimensional convex set whose extreme points are \{( \lambda_{\sigma(0)}^m,\ldots,\lambda_{\sigma(m)}^m)\}, where \sigma is any permutation of (m+1) elements. In this paper, we prove that these convex sets "converge" to a huge convex set in L^2([0,1]) whose extreme points are  f^*\circ \phi, where  f^* is the decreasing rearrangement of  f and  \phi  ranges over the set of measure preserving transformations of the unit interval  [0,1].
