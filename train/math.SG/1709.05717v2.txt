This short note considers varieties of the form G\times S_{\text{reg}}, where G is a complex semisimple group and S_{\text{reg}} is a regular Slodowy slice in the Lie algebra of G. Such varieties arise naturally in hyperk\"ahler geometry, theoretical physics, and in the theory of abstract integrable systems developed by Fernandes, Laurent-Gengoux, and Vanhaecke. In particular, previous work of the author and Rayan uses a Hamiltonian G-action to endow G\times S_{\text{reg}} with a canonical abstract integrable system. One might therefore wish to understand, in some sense, all examples of abstract integrable systems arising from Hamiltonian G-actions. Accordingly, we consider a holomorphic symplectic variety X carrying an abstract integrable system induced by a Hamiltonian G-action. Under certain hypotheses, we show that there must exist a G-equivariant variety isomorphism X\cong G\times S_{\text{reg}}.
