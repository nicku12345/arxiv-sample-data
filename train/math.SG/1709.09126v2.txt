We study singular hyperkahler quotients of the cotangent bundle of a complex semisimple Lie group as stratified spaces whose strata are hyperkahler. We focus on one particular case where the stratification satisfies the frontier condition and the partial order on the set of strata can be described explicitly by Lie theoretic data.
