We study the symplectic topology of certain K3 surfaces (including the "mirror quartic" and "mirror double plane"), equipped with certain K\"ahler forms. In particular, we prove that the symplectic Torelli group may be infinitely generated, and derive new constraints on Lagrangian tori. The key input, via homological mirror symmetry, is a result of Bayer and Bridgeland on the autoequivalence group of the derived category of an algebraic K3 surface of Picard rank one.
