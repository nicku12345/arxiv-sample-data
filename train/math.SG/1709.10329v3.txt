We show that the symplectic contraction map of Hilgert-Manon-Martens -- a symplectic version of Popov's horospherical contraction -- is simply the quotient of a Hamiltonian manifold M by a "stratified null foliation" that is determined by the group action and moment map. We also show that the quotient differential structure on the symplectic contraction of M supports a Poisson bracket. We end by proving a very general description of the topology of fibers of Gelfand-Zeitlin systems on multiplicity free Hamiltonian U(n) and SO(n) manifolds.
