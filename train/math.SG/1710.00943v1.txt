We investigate the ramifications of the Legendrian satellite construction on the relation of Lagrangian cobordism between Legendrian knots. Under a simple hypothesis, we construct a Lagrangian concordance between two Legendrian satellites by stacking up a sequence of elementary cobordisms. This construction narrows the search for "non-decomposable" Lagrangian cobordisms and yields new families of decomposable Lagrangian slice knots. Finally, we show that the maximum Thurston-Bennequin number of a smoothly slice knot provides an obstruction to any Legendrian satellite of that knot being Lagrangian slice.
