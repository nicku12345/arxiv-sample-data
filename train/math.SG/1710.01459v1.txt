This is the first of two articles in which we provide detailed and self-contained account of the construction of a system of Kuranishi structures on the moduli spaces of pseudo holomorphic disks, using the exponential decay estimate given in [FOOO7]. This article completes the construction of a Kuranishi structure of a single moduli space. This article is an improved version of [FOOO4, Part 4] and its mathematical content is taken from our earlier writing [FOn,FOOO2,FOOO4,FOOO7].
