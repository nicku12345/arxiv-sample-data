This paper was originated from overcoming the analytic difficulty in our method for constructing virtual moduli cycles in Gromov-Witten/Floer theory using global perturbations. We will discuss a new point of view on the analytic difficulty caused by the lack of smoothness of the action of the reparametrization group G on the spaces of Sobolev maps. We show that how this negative aspect of the lack of smoothness of G-action can be made into a positive and crucial analytic input stated in Theorem 1.1, from which all analytic results used in GW/Floer theory related to the lack of smoothness can be treated in a uniform and simple manner.
