We determine the homotopy type of isotropic torus complements in closed contact manifolds in terms of Reeb dynamics of special contact forms. For that we utilize holomorphic curve techniques known from symplectic field theory as Gromov-Hofer compactness and localized transversality on non-compact contact manifolds.
