In this paper, we prove a theorem that gives a simple criterion for generating commuting pairs of generalized almost complex structures on spaces that are the product of two generalized almost contact metric spaces. We examine the implications of this theorem with regard to the definition of generalized Sasakian and generalized coK\"ahler geometry.
