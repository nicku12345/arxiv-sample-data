For any asymptotically dynamically convex contact manifold Y, we show that SH_*(W)=0 is a property independent of the choice of topologically simple (i.e.\ c_1(W)=0 and \pi_{1}(Y)\rightarrow \pi_1(W) is injective) Liouville filling W. In particular, if Y is the boundary of a flexible Weinstein domain, then any topologically simple Liouville filling W has vanishing symplectic homology. As a consequence, we answer a question of Lazarev partially: a contact manifold Y admitting flexible fillings determines the integral cohomology of all the topologically simple Liouville fillings of Y. The vanishing result provides an obstruction to flexible fillability. As an application, we show that all Brieskorn manifolds of dimension \ge 5 cannot be filled by flexible Weinstein manifolds.
