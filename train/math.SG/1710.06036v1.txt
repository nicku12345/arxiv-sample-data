We show that a link in an open book can be realized as a strongly quasipositive braid if and only if it bounds a Legendrian ribbon with respect to the associated contact structure. This generalizes a result due to Baader and Ishikawa for links in the three-sphere. We highlight some related techniques for determining whether or not a link is strongly quasipositive, emphasizing applications to fibered links and satellites.
