We construct a dynamically convex contact form on the three-sphere whose systolic ratio is arbitrarily close to 2. This example is related to a conjecture of Viterbo, whose validity would imply that the systolic ratio of a convex contact form does not exceed 1. We also construct a sequence of tight contact forms \alpha_n, n\geq 2, with systolic ratio arbitrarily close to n and suitable bounds on the mean rotation number of all the closed orbits of the induced Reeb flow.
