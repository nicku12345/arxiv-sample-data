For an integer n, write X_n(K) for the 4-manifold obtained by attaching a 2-handle to the 4-ball along the knot K\subset S^3 with framing n. It is known that if n< \overline{\text{tb}}(K), then X_n(K) admits the structure of a Stein domain, and moreover the adjunction inequality implies there is an upper bound on the value of n such that X_n(K) is Stein. We provide examples of knots K and integers n\geq \overline{\text{tb}}(K) for which X_n(K) is Stein, answering an open question in the field. In fact, our family of examples shows that the largest framing such that the manifold X_n(K) admits a Stein structure can be arbitrarily larger than \overline{\text{tb}}(K). We also provide an upper bound on the Stein framings for K that is typically stronger than that coming from the adjunction inequality.
