For a Liouville domain W whose boundary admits a periodic Reeb flow, we can consider the connected component [\tau] \in \pi_0(\text{Symp}^c(\widehat W)) of fibered twists. In this paper, we investigate an entropy-type invariant, called the slow volume growth, of the component [\tau] and give a uniform lower bound of the growth using wrapped Floer homology. We also show that [\tau] has infinite order in \pi_0(\text{Symp}^c(\widehat W)) if there is an admissible Lagrangian L in W whose wrapped Floer homology is infinite dimensional. We apply our results to fibered twists coming from the Milnor fibers of A_k-type singularities and complements of a symplectic hypersurface in a real symplectic manifold. They admit so-called real Lagrangians, and we can explicitly compute wrapped Floer homology groups using a version of Morse-Bott spectral sequences.
