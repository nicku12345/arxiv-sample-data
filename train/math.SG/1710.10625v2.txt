Using Lagrangian Floer theory, we study the tropical geometry of K3 surfaces with general singular fibres. In particular, we give the local models for the type I_n, II, III and IV singular fibres in the Kodaira's classification and generalize the correspondence theorem between open Gromov-Witten invariants/tropical discs counting to these cases.
