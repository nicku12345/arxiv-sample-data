We prove the existence of a one-parameter family of nondisplaceable Lagrangian tori near a linear chain of Lagrangian 2-spheres in a symplectic 4-manifold. When the symplectic structure is rational we prove that the deformed Floer cohomology groups of these tori are nontrivial. The proof uses the idea of toric degeneration to analyze the full potential functions with bulk deformations of these tori.
