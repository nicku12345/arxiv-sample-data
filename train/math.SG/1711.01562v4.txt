We construct examples in any odd dimension of contact manifolds with finite and non-zero algebraic torsion (in the sense of Latschev-Wendl), which are therefore tight and do not admit strong symplectic fillings. We prove that Giroux torsion implies algebraic 1-torsion in any odd dimension, which proves a conjecture by Massot-Niederkrueger-Wendl. We construct infinitely many non-diffeomorphic examples of 5-dimensional contact manifolds which are tight, admit no strong fillings, and do not have Giroux torsion. We obtain obstruction results for symplectic cobordisms, for which we give a proof not relying on SFT machinery. We give a tentative definition of a higher-dimensional spinal open book decomposition, based on the 3-dimensional one of Lisi-van Horn Morris-Wendl. An appendix written in co-authorship with Richard Siefring gives a basic outline of the intersection theory for punctured holomorphic curves and hypersurfaces, which generalizes his 3-dimensional results of Siefring to higher dimensions. From the intersection theory we obtain an application to codimension-2 holomorphic foliations, which we use to restrict the behaviour of holomorphic curves in our examples.
