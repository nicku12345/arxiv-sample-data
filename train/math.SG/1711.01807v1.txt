We study the symplectic geometry of the SU(2)-representation variety of the compact oriented surface of genus 2. We use the Goldman flows to identify subsets of the moduli space with corresponding subsets of \mathbb P^3(\mathbb C). We also define and study two antisymplectic involutions on the moduli space and their fixed point sets.
