We build a bridge between Floer theory on open symplectic manifolds and the enumerative geometry of holomorphic disks inside their Fano compactifications, by detecting elements in symplectic cohomology which are mirror to Landau-Ginzburg potentials. We also treat the higher Maslov index versions of the potentials.   We discover a relation between higher disk potentials and symplectic cohomology rings of smooth anticanonical divisor complements (themselves conjecturally related to closed-string Gromov-Witten invariants), and explore several other applications to the geometry of Liouville domains.
