The Siegel upper half space, \mathcal{S}_n, the space of complex symmetric matrices, Z with positive definite imaginary part, is the generalization of the complex upper half plane in higher dimensions. In this paper, we study a generalization of linear fractional transformations, \Phi_S, where S is a complex symplectic matrix, on the Siegel upper half space. We partially classify the complex symplectic matrices for which \Phi_S(Z) is well defined. We also consider \mathcal S_n and \overline{\mathcal S}_n as metric spaces and discuss distance properties of the map \Phi_S from \mathcal S_n to \mathcal{S}_n and \overline{\mathcal S}_n respectively.
