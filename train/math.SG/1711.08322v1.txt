We construct an infinite family of odd-symplectic forms (also known as Hamiltonian structures) on the 3-sphere that do not admit a symplectic cobordism to the standard contact structure on the 3-sphere. This answers in the negative a question raised by Joel Fish motivated by the search for minimal characteristic flows.
