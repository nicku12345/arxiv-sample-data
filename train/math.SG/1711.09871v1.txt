We are interested in comparing properties of symplectic mapping class groups of symplectic manifolds of dimension four or higher with properties of classical mapping class groups of surfaces. For n \geq 2, consider a configuration of Lagrangian S^ns in a Weinstein domain M^{2n}. If it is analogous, in some sense that we make precise, to a configuration of exact Lagrangian S^1s on a surface \Sigma, we show that any relation between Dehn twists in the S^ns must also hold between the S^1s. Such analogous pairs of configurations include plumbings of T^\ast S^1s and T^\ast S^ns with the same plumbing graph, and vanishing cycles for a two-variable singularity and for its stabilisation. We give a number of corollaries for subgroups of symplectic mapping class groups.
