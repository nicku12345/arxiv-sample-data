This paper represents a first step towards the extension of the definition of Rabinowitz Floer homology to non-compact energy hypersurfaces in exact symplectic manifolds. More concretely, we study under which conditions it is possible to establish L^{\infty}-bounds for the Floer trajectories of a Hamiltonian with non-compact energy levels. Moreover, we introduce a class of Hamiltonians, called tentacular Hamiltonians, which satisfy the conditions: how to define RFH for these examples will be the subject of a follow-up paper.
