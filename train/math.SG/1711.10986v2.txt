Scattering symplectic manifolds are (closed) manifolds with a mildly degenerate Poisson structure. In particular they can be viewed as symplectic structures on a Lie algebroid which is almost everywhere isomorphic to the tangent bundle. In this paper we prove that all scattering symplectic manifolds arise as glueings of weak symplectic fillings of contact manifolds, and all pairs of weak symplectic fillings with matching boundaries can be glued to a scattering symplectic manifold.
