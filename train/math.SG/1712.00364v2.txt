One way to obtain invariants of some Legendrian submanifolds in 1-jet spaces J^1M, equipped with the standard contact structure, is through the Morse theoretic technique of generating families. This paper extends the invariant of generating family cohomology by giving it a product \mu_2. To define the product, moduli spaces of flow trees are constructed and shown to have the structure of a smooth manifold with corners. These spaces consist of intersecting half-infinite gradient trajectories of functions whose critical points correspond to Reeb chords of the Legendrian. This paper lays the foundation for an A_\infty algebra which will show, in particular, that \mu_2 is associative and thus gives generating family cohomology a ring structure.
