The Whitney immersion is a Lagrangian sphere inside the four-dimensional symplectic vector space which has a single transverse double point of Whitney self-intersection number +1. This Lagrangian also arises as the Weinstein skeleton of the complement of a binodal cubic curve inside the projective plane, and the latter Weinstein manifold is thus the `standard' neighbourhood of Lagrangian immersions of this type. We classify the Lagrangians inside such a neighbourhood which are homologically essential, and which either are embedded or immersed with a single double point; they are shown to be Hamiltonian isotopic to either product tori, Chekanov tori, or rescalings of the Whitney immersion.
