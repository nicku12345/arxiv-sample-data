Let \sf X be a symplectic orbifold groupoid with \sf S being a symplectic sub-orbifold groupoid, and \sf X_{\mathfrak a} be the weight-\mathfrak a blowup of \sf X along \sf S with \sf Z being the corresponding exceptional divisor. We show that there is a weighted blowup correspondence between some certain absolute orbifold Gromov--Witten invariants of \sf X relative to \sf S and some certain relative orbifold Gromov--Witten invariants of the pair (\sf X_{\mathfrak a}|Z). As an application, we prove that the symplectic uniruledness of symplectic orbifold groupoids is a weighted blowup invariant.
