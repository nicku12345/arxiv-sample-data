In this paper we study the interplay between Lagrangian cobordisms and stability conditions. We show that any stability condition on the derived Fukaya category D\mathcal{F}uk(M) of a symplectic manifold (M,\omega) induces a stability condition on the derived Fukaya category of Lagrangian cobordisms D\mathcal{F}uk(\mathbb{C} \times M). In addition, using stability conditions, we provide general conditions under which the homomorphism \Theta: \Omega_{Lag}(M)\to K_0(D\mathcal{F}uk(M)), introduced by Biran and Cornea, is an isomorphism. This yields a better understanding of how stability conditions affect \Theta and it allows us to elucidate Haug's result, that the Lagrangian cobordism group of T^2 is isomorphic to K_0(D\mathcal{F}uk(T^2)).
