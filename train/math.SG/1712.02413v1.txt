Given a smooth spacelike surface \Sigma of negative curvature in Anti-de Sitter space of dimension 3, invariant by a representation \rho:\pi_1(S)\to\mathrm{PSL}_2\mathbb{R}\times\mathrm{PSL}_2\mathbb{R} where S is a closed oriented surface of genus \geq 2, a canonical construction associates to \Sigma a diffeomorphism \phi_\Sigma of S. It turns out that \phi_\Sigma is a symplectomorphism for the area forms of the two hyperbolic metrics h and h' on S induced by the action of \rho on \mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{H}^2. Using an algebraic construction related to the flux homomorphism, we give a new proof of the fact that \phi_\Sigma is the composition of a Hamiltonian symplectomorphism of (S,h) and the unique minimal Lagrangian diffeomorphism from (S,h) to (S,h').
