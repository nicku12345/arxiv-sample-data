Assume the existence of a Fukaya category \mathrm{Fuk}(X) of a compact symplectic manifold X with some expected properties. In this paper, we show \mathscr{A} \subset \mathrm{Fuk}(X) split generates a summand \mathrm{Fuk}(X)_e \subset \mathrm{Fuk}(X) corresponding to an idempotent e \in QH^\bullet(X) if the Mukai pairing of \mathscr{A} is perfect. Moreover we show HH^\bullet(\mathscr{A}) \cong QH^\bullet(X) e. As an application we compute the quantum cohomology and the Fukaya category of a blow-up of \mathbb{C} P^2 at four points with a monotone symplectic structure.
