It was proved by Fan--Lee and Fan that the absolute Gromov--Witten invariants of two projective bundles \mathbb P(V_i)\rightarrow X are identified canonically when the total Chern classes c(V_1)=c(V_2) for two bundles V_1 and V_2 over a smooth projective variety X. In this note we show that for the two projective completions \mathbb P(V_i\oplus\mathcal O) of V_i and their infinity divisors \mathbb P(V_i), the relative Gromov--Witten invariants of (\mathbb P(V_i\oplus\mathcal O),\mathbb P(V_i)) are identified canonically when c(V_1)=c(V_2).
