We study two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems. Let us assume that the zero energy level of a real-analytic Hamiltonian function H:\mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R} contains a saddle-center equilibrium point lying in a strictly convex sphere-like singular subset S_0\subset H^{-1}(0). From previous work [de Paulo-Salom\~ao, Memoirs of the AMS] we know that for any small energy E>0, the energy level H^{-1}(E) contains a closed 3-ball S_E in a neighborhood of S_0 admitting a singular foliation called 2-3 foliation. One of the binding orbits of this singular foliation is the Lyapunoff orbit P_{2,E} contained in the center manifold of the saddle-center. The other binding orbit lies in the interior of S_E and spans a one parameter family of disks transverse to the Hamiltonian vector field. In this article we show that the 2-3 foliation forces the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits and infinitely many homoclinics to P_{2,E} in S_E. Moreover, if the branches of the stable and unstable manifolds of P_{2,E} inside S_E do not coincide then the Hamiltonian flow on S_E has positive topological entropy. We also present applications of these results to some classical Hamiltonian systems.
