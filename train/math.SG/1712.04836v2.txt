In this paper, we establish equivariant mirror symmetry for the weighted projective line. This extends the results by B. Fang, C.C. Liu and Z. Zong, where the projective line was considered [{\it Geometry \& Topology} 24:2049-2092, 2017]. More precisely, we prove the equivalence of the R-matrices for A-model and B-model at large radius limit, and establish isomorphism for R-matrices for general radius. We further demonstrate that the graph sum of higher genus cases are the same for both models, hence establish equivariant mirror symmetry for the weighted projective line.
