An exact Lagrangian submanifold L in the symplectization of standard contact (2n-1)-space with Legendrian boundary \Sigma can be glued to itself along \Sigma. This gives a Legendrian embedding \Lambda(L,L) of the double of L into contact (2n+1)-space. We show that the Legendrian isotopy class of \Lambda(L,L) is determined by formal data: the manifold L together with a trivialization of its complexified tangent bundle. In particular, if L is a disk then \Lambda(L,L) is the Legendrian unknot.
