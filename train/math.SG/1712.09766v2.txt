The main theme of the paper is the dynamics of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of {\mathbb C}{\mathbb P}^n with the minimal possible number of periodic points (equal to n+1 by Arnold's conjecture), called here Hamiltonian pseudo-rotations. We prove several results on the dynamics of pseudo-rotations going beyond periodic orbits, using Floer theoretical methods. One of these results is the existence of invariant sets in arbitrarily small punctured neighborhoods of the fixed points, partially extending a theorem of Le Calvez and Yoccoz and Franks to higher dimensions. The other is a strong variant of the Lagrangian Poincar\'e recurrence conjecture for pseudo-rotations. We also prove the C^0-rigidity of pseudo-rotations with exponentially Liouville mean index vector. This is a higher-dimensional counterpart of a theorem of Bramham establishing such rigidity for pseudo-rotations of the disk.
