Given a symplectic manifold (M,\omega) endowed with a proper Hamiltonian action of a Lie group G, we consider the action induced by a Lie subgroup H of G. We propose a construction for two compatible Witt-Artin decompositions of the tangent space of M, one relative to the G-action and one relative to the H-action. In particular, we provide an explicit relation between the respective symplectic slices.
