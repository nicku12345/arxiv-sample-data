We study an algebro-geometric approach to symplectic cohomology in terms of tropical geometry and log Gromov-Witten theory. As the degree zero piece of symplectic cohomology conjecturally is isomorphic to the ring of theta functions of Gross-Hacking-Siebert, our main goal in this paper is to introduce algebro-geometric tools capturing analogues of the algebraic structures arising in symplectic cohomology, in the ring of theta functions. For this, we focus on the Tate curve T, a degeneration of elliptic curves to a cycle of projective lines, and investigate (a version of) the symplectic cohomology SH^*(T\setminus T_0) for the complement of the central fiber of T. We study SH^*(T\setminus T_0), first by going through the Lagrangian Floer cohomology of the elliptic curve, and then by investigating the Floer multiplication using tropical Morse trees introduced by Abouzaid-Gross-Siebert, as combinatorial analogues of holomorphic discs bounded by Lagrangians. From tropical Morse trees, we construct tropical analogues of holomorphic Riemann surfaces with punctures in T, which we call tropical corals, capturing the product in symplectic cohomology. Our main result is a tropical correspondence theorem between tropical corals and punctured log maps defined by Abramovich-Chen-Gross-Siebert. This uses an interpretation of punctured log maps as log maps with non-complete components.
