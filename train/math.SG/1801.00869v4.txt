The Bourgeois construction associates to every contact open book on a manifold V a contact structure on V\times T^2. We study in this article some of the properties of V that are inherited by V\times T^2 and some that are not.   Giroux has provided recently a suitable framework to work with contact open books. In the appendix of this article, we quickly review this formalism, and we work out a few classical examples of contact open books to illustrate how to use this new language.
