In this paper, we study contact surgeries along Legendrian links in the standard contact 3-sphere. On one hand, we use algebraic methods to prove the vanishing of the contact Ozsv\'{a}th-Szab\'{o} invariant for contact (+1)-surgery along certain Legendrian two-component links. The main tool is a link surgery formula for Heegaard Floer homology developed by Manolescu and Ozsv\'{a}th. On the other hand, we use contact-geometric argument to show the overtwistedness of the contact 3-manifolds obtained by contact (+1)-surgeries along Legendrian two-component links whose two components are linked in some special configurations.
