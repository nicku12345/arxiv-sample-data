Previously, Cristofaro-Gardiner, Hutchings and Ramos have proved that embedded contact homology (ECH) capacities can recover the volume of a contact 3-manifod in their paper "the asymptotics of ECH capacities" . There were two main steps to proving this theorem: The first step used an estimate for the energy of min-max Seiberg-Witten Floer generators. The second step used embedded balls in a certain symplectic four manifold.   In this paper, stronger estimates on the energy of min-max Seiberg-Witten Floer generators are derived. This stronger estimate implies directly the "ECH capacities recover volume" theorem (without the help of embedded balls in a certain symplectic four manifold), and moreover, gives an estimate on its speed.
