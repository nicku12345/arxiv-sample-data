This paper defines symplectic scale manifolds based on Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder's scale calculus. We introduce Hamiltonian vector fields and flows on these by narrowing down sc-smoothness to what we denote by strong sc-smoothness, a concept which effectively formalizes the desired smoothness properties for Hamiltonian functions. We show the concept to be invariant under sc-smooth symplectomorphisms, whence it is compatible with Hofer's scale manifolds. We develop and verify the theory at the hand of the free Schr\"odinger equation.
