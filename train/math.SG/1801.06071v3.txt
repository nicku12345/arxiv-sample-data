We study fixed-point loci of Nakajima varieties under symplectomorphisms and their anti-symplectic cousins, which are compositions of a diagram automorphism, a reflection functor and a transpose defined by certain bilinear forms. These subvarieties provide a natural home for geometric representation theory of symmetric pairs. In particular, the cohomology of a Steinberg-type variety of the symplectic fixed-point subvarieties is conjecturally related to the universal enveloping algebra of the subalgebra in a symmetric pair. The latter symplectic subvarieties are further used to construct geometrically an action of a twisted Yangian on torus equivariant cohomology of Nakajima varieties. In type A case, these subvarieties provide a quiver model for partial Springer resolutions of nilpotent Slodowy slices of classical groups and associated symmetric spaces, which leads to a rectangular symmetry and a refinement of Kraft-Procesi row/column removal reductions.
