We study the symplectic embedding capacity function C_{\beta} for ellipsoids E(1,\alpha)\subset R^4 into dilates of polydisks P(1,\beta) as both \alpha and \beta vary through [1,\infty). For \beta=1 Frenkel and Mueller showed that C_{\beta} has an infinite staircase accumulating at \alpha=3+2\sqrt{2}, while for integer \beta\geq 2 Cristofaro-Gardiner, Frenkel, and Schlenk found that no infinite staircase arises. We show that, for arbitrary \beta\in (1,\infty), the restriction of C_{\beta} to [1,3+2\sqrt{2}] is determined entirely by the obstructions from Frenkel and Mueller's work, leading C_{\beta} on this interval to have a finite staircase with the number of steps tending to \infty as \beta\to 1. On the other hand, in contrast to the case of integer \beta, for a certain doubly-indexed sequence of irrational numbers L_{n,k} we find that C_{L_{n,k}} has an infinite staircase; these L_{n,k} include both numbers that are arbitrarily large and numbers that are arbitrarily close to 1, with the corresponding accumulation points respectively arbitrarily large and arbitrarily close to 3+2\sqrt{2}.
