We introduce a joint project with Cheol-Hyun Cho on the construction of quantum-corrected moduli of Lagrangian immersions. The construction has important applications to mirror symmetry for pair-of-pants decompositions, SYZ and wall-crossing. The key ingredient is Floer-theoretical gluing between local moduli spaces of Lagrangians with different topologies.
