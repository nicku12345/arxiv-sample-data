We describe generating functions for arbitrary-genus Gromov-Witten invariants of the projective space with any number of marked points explicitly. The structural portion of this description gives rise to uniform energy bounds and vanishing results for these invariants. They suggest deep conjectures relating Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic manifolds to the energy of pseudo-holomorphic maps and the expected dimension of their moduli space.
