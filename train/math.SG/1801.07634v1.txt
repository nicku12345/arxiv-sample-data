We prove that Khovanov homology detects the trefoils. Our proof incorporates an array of ideas in Floer homology and contact geometry. It uses open books; the contact invariants we defined in the instanton Floer setting; a bypass exact triangle in sutured instanton homology, proven here; and Kronheimer and Mrowka's spectral sequence relating Khovanov homology with singular instanton knot homology. As a byproduct, we also strengthen a result of Kronheimer and Mrowka on SU(2) representations of the knot group.
