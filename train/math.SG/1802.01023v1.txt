Let L be a 4th order differential operator with coefficients in \mathbb{K}(z), with \mathbb{K} a computable algebraically closed field. The operator L is called symplectic when up to rational gauge transformation, the fundamental matrix of solutions X satisfies X^t J X=J where J is the standard symplectic matrix. It is called projectively symplectic when it is projectively equivalent to a symplectic operator. We design an algorithm to test if L is projectively symplectic. Furthermore, based on Kovacic's algorithm, we design an algorithm that computes Liouvillian solutions of projectively symplectic operators of order 4. Moreover, using Klein's Theorem, algebraic solutions are given as pullbacks of standard hypergeometric equations.
