We construct a Lagrangian submanifold, inside the cotangent bundle of a real torus, which we call a Lagrangian pair of pants. It is given as the graph of the differential of a smooth function defined on the real blow up of a Lagrangian coamoeba. Lagrangian pairs of pants are the main building blocks in a construction of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds of (\mathbb{C}^*)^n which lift tropical subvarieties in \mathbb{R}^n. As an example we explain how to lift tropical curves in \mathbb{R}^2 to Lagrangian submanifolds of (\mathbb{C}^*)^2. We also give several new examples of Lagrangian submanifolds inside toric varieties, some of which are monotone.
