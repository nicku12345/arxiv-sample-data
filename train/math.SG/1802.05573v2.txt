\mathcal{H}-holomorphic curves are solutions of a specific modification of the pseudoholomorphic curve equation in symplectizations involving a harmonic 1-form as perturbation term. In this paper we study the asymptotics of \mathcal{H}-holomorphic curves defined on a sequence of degenerating cylinders.
