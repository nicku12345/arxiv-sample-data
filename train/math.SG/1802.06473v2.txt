The paper associates Lagrangian submanifolds in symplectic toric varieties to certain tropical curves inside the convex polyhedral domains of \R^n that appear as the images of the moment map of the toric varieties.   We pay a particular attention to the case n=2, where we reprove Givental's theorem on Lagrangian embeddability of non-oriented surfaces to \C^2, as well as to the case n=3, where we see appearance of the graph 3-manifolds studied by Waldhausen as Lagrangian submanifolds. In particular, rational tropical curves in \R^3 produce 3-dimensional rational homology spheres. The order of their first homology groups is determined by the multiplicity of tropical curves in the corresponding enumerative problems.
