\mathcal{H}-holomorphic curves are solutions of a specific modification of the pseudoholomorphic curve equation in symplectizations involving a harmonic 1-form as perturbation term. In this paper we compactify the moduli space of \mathcal{H}-holomorphic curves with a priori bounds on the harmonic 1-forms.
