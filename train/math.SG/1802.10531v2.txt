We establish relationships between two classes of invariants of Legendrian knots in \mathbb{R}^3: Representation numbers of the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA and satellite ruling polynomials. For positive permutation braids, \beta \subset J^1S^1, we give a precise formula in terms of representation numbers for the m-graded ruling polynomial R^m_{S(K,\beta)}(z) of the satellite of K with \beta specialized at z=q^{1/2}-q^{-1/2} with q a prime power, and we use this formula to prove that arbitrary m-graded satellite ruling polynomials, R^m_{S(K,L)}, are determined by the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA of K. Conversely, for m\neq 1, we introduce an n-colored m-graded ruling polynomial, R^m_{n,K}(q), in strict analogy with the n-colored HOMFLY-PT polynomial, and show that the total n-dimensional m-graded representation number of K to \mathbb{F}_q^n, \mbox{Rep}_m(K,\mathbb{F}_q^n), is exactly equal to R^m_{n,K}(q). In the case of 2-graded representations, we show that R^2_{n,K}=\mbox{Rep}_2(K, \mathbb{F}_q^n) arises as a specialization of the n-colored HOMFLY-PT polynomial.
