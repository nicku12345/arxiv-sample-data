In this paper, we consider stochastic Runge-Kutta methods for stochastic Hamiltonian partial differential equations and present some sufficient conditions for multisymplecticity of stochastic Runge-Kutta methods of stochastic Hamiltonian partial differential equations. Particularly, we apply these ideas to stochastic Maxwell equations with multiplicative noise, possessing the stochastic multi-symplectic conservation law and energy conservation law. Theoretical analysis shows that the methods can preserve both the discrete stochastic multi-symplectic conservation law and discrete energy conservation law almost surely.
