Let W(z_1, \cdots, z_n): (\mathbb{C}^*)^n \to \mathbb{C} be a Laurent polynomial in n variables, and let \mathcal{H} be a generic smooth fiber of W. In \cite{RSTZ} Ruddat-Sibilla-Treumann-Zaslow give a combinatorial recipe for a skeleton for \mathcal{H}. In this paper, we show that for a suitable exact symplectic structure on \mathcal{H}, the RSTZ-skeleton can be realized as the Liouville Lagrangian skeleton.
