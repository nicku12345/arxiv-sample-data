We classify, up to symplectomorphisms, a neighborhood of a singular fiber of an integrable system (which is proper and has connected fibers) containing k > 1 focus-focus critical points. Our result shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between such neighborhoods and k formal power series, up to a (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times D_k)-action, where D_k is the k-th dihedral group. The k formal power series determine the dynamical behavior of the Hamiltonian vector fields X_{f_1}, X_{f_2} associated to the components f_1, f_2 \colon (M, \omega) \to \mathbb{R} of the integrable system on the symplectic manifold (M,\omega) via the differential equation \omega(X_{f_i}, \cdot) = \mathop{}\!\mathrm{d} f_i, near the singular fiber containing the k focus-focus critical points. This proves a conjecture of San Vu Ngoc from 2002.
