This paper presents a few remarks about the topology of symplectic hyperplane sections and the geometry of their complements. In particular, it contains a detailed proof of the following result already stated with hints in [Gi]: for sufficiently large degrees, the complements of Donaldson's symplectic hyperplane sections are naturally Weinstein --- and less naturally Stein --- manifolds.
