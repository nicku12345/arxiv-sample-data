We show that a dynamically convex Reeb flow on the standard tight lens space (L(p, 1),\xi_{\mathrm{std}}), p>1, admits a p-unknotted closed Reeb orbit P which is the binding of a rational open book decomposition with disk-like pages. Each page is a rational global surface of section for the Reeb flow and the Conley-Zehnder index of the p-th iterate of P is 3. We also check dynamical convexity in the H\'enon-Heiles system for low positive energies. In this case the rational open book decomposition follows from the fact that the sphere-like component of the energy surface admits a \mathbb{Z}_{3}-symmetric periodic orbit and the flow descends to a Reeb flow on the standard tight (L(3,2),\xi_{\mathrm{std}}).
