We prove a decomposition formula for Verlinde sums (rational trigonometric sums), as a discrete counterpart to the Boysal-Vergne decomposition formula for Bernoulli series. Motivated by applications to fixed point formulas in Hamiltonian geometry, we develop differential form valued version of Bernoulli series and Verlinde sums, and extend the decomposition formula to this wider context.
