We prove that every closed Bohr-Sommerfeld Lagrangian submanifold Q of a symplectic/K\"ahler manifold X can be realised as a Morse-Bott minimum for some 'convex' exhausting function defined in the complement of a symplectic/complex hyperplane section Y. In the K\"ahler case, 'convex' means strictly plurisubharmonic while, in the symplectic case, it refers to the existence of a Liouville pseudogradient. In particular, Q\subset X\setminus Y is a regular Lagrangian submanifold in the sense of Eliashberg-Ganatra-Lazarev.
