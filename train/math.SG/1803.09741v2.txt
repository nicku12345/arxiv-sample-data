We study the Poisson bracket invariant pb, which measures the level of Poisson noncommutativity of a smooth partition of unity, on closed symplectic surfaces. Building on preliminary work of Buhovsky and Tanny, we prove that for any smooth partition of unity subordinated to an open cover consisting in discs of area at most c, if moreover the open cover satisfies some localization condition when the surface is a sphere, then the product of this invariant with c is bounded from below by a universal constant. This result, which could be understood as a symplectic version of the mean value theorem, thereby answers a question of L. Polterovich for closed surfaces of genus g \ge 1. Polterovich's question was also independently answered by Buhovski-Logunov-Tanny for all closed surfaces via different methods. However, whereas Buhovsky-Logunov-Tanny's arguments are of a global nature, our arguments are more local; incidentally, the range of applicability of the two methods are not the same, and whenever both methods apply, ours appear to be sharper. This justifies a discussion of the sharpness of our own results. We also included a short survey on the work around Polterovich's question at the end of the paper.
