One of the attractions of homological mirror symmetry is that it not only implies the previous predictions of mirror symmetry (e.g., curve counts on the quintic), but it should in some sense be `less of a coincidence' than they are and therefore easier to prove. In this survey we explain how Seidel's approach to mirror symmetry via versality at the large volume/large complex structure limit makes this idea precise.
