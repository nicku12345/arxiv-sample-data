We show that the Ginzburg-Weinstein diffeomorphism \mathfrak{u}(n)^* \to U(n)^* of Alekseev-Meinrenken admits a scaling tropical limit on an open dense subset of \mathfrak{u}(n)^*. The target of the limit map is a product \mathcal{C} \times T, where \mathcal{C} is the interior of a cone, T is a torus, and \mathcal{C} \times T carries an integrable system with natural action-angle coordinates. The pull-back of these coordinates to \mathfrak{u}(n)^* recovers the Gelfand-Zeitlin integrable system of Guillemin-Sternberg. As a by-product of our proof, we show that the Lagrangian tori of the Flaschka-Ratiu integrable system on the set of upper triangular matrices meet the set of totally positive matrices for sufficiently large action coordinates.
