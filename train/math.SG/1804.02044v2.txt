Symplectic flux measures the areas of cylinders swept in the process of a Lagrangian isotopy. We study flux via a numerical invariant of a Lagrangian submanifold that we define using its Fukaya algebra. The main geometric feature of the invariant is its concavity over isotopies with linear flux.   We derive constraints on flux, Weinstein neighbourhood embeddings and holomorphic disk potentials for Gelfand-Cetlin fibres of Fano varieties in terms of their polytopes. We show that Calabi-Yau SYZ fibres have unobstructed Floer theory under a general assumption. We also describe the space of fibres of almost toric fibrations on the complex projective plane up to Hamiltonian isotopy, and provide other applications.
