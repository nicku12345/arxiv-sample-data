We consider a fibered Lagrangian L in a compact symplectic fibration with small monotone fibers, and develop a strategy for lifting J-holomorphic disks with Lagrangian boundary from the base to the total space. In case L is a product, we use this machinery to give a formula for the leading order potential and formulate an unobstructedness criteria for the A_\infty algebra. We provide some explicit computations, one of which involves finding an embedded 2n+k dimensional submanifold of Floer-non-trivial tori in an 2n+2k dimensional fiber bundle.
