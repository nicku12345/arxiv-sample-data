We construct a Lagrangian torus fibration on a smooth hypertoric variety and a corresponding SYZ mirror variety using T-duality and generating functions of open Gromov-Witten invariants. The variety is singular in general. We construct a resolution using the wall and chamber structure of the SYZ base.
