We study a class of Poisson tensors on a fibered manifold which are compatible with the fiber bundle structure by the so-called almost coupling condition. In the case of a 5-dimensional orientable fibered manifolds with 2-dimensional bases, we describe a global behavior of almost coupling Poisson tensors and their singularities by using a bigraded factorization of the Jacobi identity. In particular, we present some unimodularity criteria and describe a class of gauge type transformations preserving the almost coupling property.
