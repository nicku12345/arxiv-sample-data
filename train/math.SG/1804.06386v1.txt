Let X be a compact toric variety. The quantum cohomology of X decomposes as a direct sum, and associated to each summand Q is a toric fibre L_Q with rank 1 local system. By building an explicit twisted-complex-like object, we show that on Q the Kodaira-Spencer isomorphism of Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono factors through the closed-open string map to the Hochschild cohomology of L_Q. We deduce that the latter is injective and hence, assuming an appropriate version of Abouzaid's criterion, that L_Q split generates the corresponding summand of the Fukaya category.
