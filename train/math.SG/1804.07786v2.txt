When V is a vector space and G is a connected reductive group, we find a closed formula for the equivariant twisted quasimap I-function of the GIT quotient V\mathord{/\mkern-6mu/}_{\theta} G. Our formula relates the I-function of V\mathord{/\mkern-6mu/}_{\theta} G to that of V\mathord{/\mkern-6mu/}_{\theta} T for a maximal torus T of G, proving the abelian-nonabelian correspondence for I-functions. We apply the formula to compute the J-functions of some Grassmann bundles on Grassmann varieties and Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in them.
