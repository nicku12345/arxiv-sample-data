If (X, \omega) is a symplectic manifold, and \Sigma is a smooth symplectic submanifold Poincar\'e dual to a positive multiple of \omega, X \setminus \Sigma admits a compactification as a Liouville domain, which we then complete to (W, d\lambda).   Under monotonicity assumptions on X and on \Sigma, we construct a chain complex whose homology computes the Symplectic Homology of W. We show the differential is given in terms of Morse contributions, terms computed from Gromov-Witten invariants of X relative to \Sigma and terms computed from the Gromov-Witten invariants of \Sigma.   We use a Morse-Bott model for symplectic homology. Our proof involves comparing Floer cylinders with punctures to pseudoholomorphic curves in in the symplectization of the unit normal bundle to \Sigma.
