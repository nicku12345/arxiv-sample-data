Let \{\Lambda^\infty_t\} be an isotopy of Legendrians (possibly singular) in a unit cosphere bundle S^*M. Let Sh(M, \Lambda^\infty_t) be the differential graded (dg) derived category of constructible sheaves on M with singular support at infinity contained in \Lambda^\infty_t. We prove that if the isotopy of Legendrians embeds into an isotopy of Weinstein hypersurfaces, then the categories Sh(M, \Lambda^\infty_t) are invariant.
