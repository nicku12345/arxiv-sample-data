We introduce the notion of complex G_2 manifold M_{\mathbb C}, and complexification of a G_2 manifold M\subset M_{\mathbb C}. As an application we show the following: If (Y,s) is a closed oriented 3-manifold with a Spin^{c} structure, and (Y,s)\subset (M, \varphi) is an imbedding as an associative submanifold of some G_2 manifold (such imbedding always exists), then the isotropic associative deformations of Y in the complexified G_2 manifold M_{\mathbb C} is given by Seiberg-Witten equations.
