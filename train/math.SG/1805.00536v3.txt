The Ricci form is a moment map for the action of the group of exact volume preserving diffeomorphisms on the space of almost complex structures. This observation yields a new approach to the Weil-Petersson symplectic form on the Teichmuller space of isotopy classes of complex structures with real first Chern class zero and nonempty Kahler cone.
