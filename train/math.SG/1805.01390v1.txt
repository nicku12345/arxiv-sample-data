An embedding \varphi \colon (M_1, \omega_1) \to (M_2, \omega_2) (of symplectic manifolds of the same dimension) is called \epsilon-symplectic if the difference \varphi^* \omega_2 - \omega_1 is \epsilon-small with respect to a fixed Riemannian metric on M_1. We prove that if a sequence of \epsilon-symplectic embeddings converges uniformly (on compact subsets) to another embedding, then the limit is E-symplectic, where the number E depends only on \epsilon and E (\epsilon) \to 0 as \epsilon \to 0. This generalizes C^0-rigidity of symplectic embeddings, and answers a question in topological quantum computing by Michael Freedman. As in the symplectic case, this rigidity theorem can be deduced from the existence and properties of symplectic capacities. An \epsilon-symplectic embedding preserves capacity up to an \epsilon-small error, and linear \epsilon-symplectic maps can be characterized by the property that they preserve the symplectic spectrum of ellipsoids (centered at the origin) up to an error that is \epsilon-small. We sketch an alternative proof using the shape invariant, which gives rise to an analogous characterization and rigidity theorem for \epsilon-contact embeddings.
