We construct a quantum deformation of the Steenrod square construction on closed monotone symplectic manifolds, based on the work of Fukaya, Betz and Cohen. We prove quantum versions of the Cartan and Adem relations. We compute the quantum Steenrod squares for all CP n and give the means of computation for all toric varieties. As an application, we also describe two examples of blowups along a subvariety, in which a quantum correction of the Steenrod square on the blowup is determined by the classical Steenrod square on the subvariety.
