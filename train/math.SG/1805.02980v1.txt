We present a higher-dimensional version of the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff theorem which applies to Poincar\'e time maps of Hamiltonian systems. The maps under consideration are neither required to be close to the identity nor to have a monotone twist. The annulus is replaced by the product of an N-dimensional torus and the interior of a (N-1)-dimensional (not necessarily convex) embedded sphere; on the other hand, the classical boundary twist condition is replaced by an avoiding rays condition.
