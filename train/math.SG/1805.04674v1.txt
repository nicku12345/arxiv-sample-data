In this paper, we calculate H\"ormander index in the finite-dimensional case. Then we use the result to give some iteration inequalities, and prove almost existence of mean indices for given complete autonomous Hamiltonian system on compact symplectic manifold with symplectic trivial tangent bundle and given autonomous Hamiltonian system on regular compact energy hypersurface of symplectic manifold with symplectic trivial tangent bundle.
