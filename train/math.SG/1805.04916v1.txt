This is the author's PhD Thesis (University of Cambridge, 2014) in its original form. In the first part, using an invariance result, we compute the symplectic homology of contact-type energy levels for magnetic systems on surfaces, provided the energy is very large or very small. In the second part, which is partially contained in the later paper (Benedetti, Ergod. Theory Dynam. Syst., 2016), we discuss some rotationally symmetric examples and establish dynamical convexity for symplectic magnetic flows on low energy levels.
