Suppose (B,\pi) is an open book supporting (Y,\xi), where the binding B is possibly disconnected, and K is a braid about this open book. Then B\cup K is naturally a transverse link in (Y,\xi). We prove that the transverse link invariant in knot Floer homology, \[\widehat{t}(B\cup K)\in \widehat{HFK}(-Y,B\cup K),\] defined in [BVV13] is always nonzero. This generalizes the main results of Etnyre and Vela-Vick in [VV11, EVV10]. As an application, we show that if K is braided about an open book with connected binding, and has fractional Dehn twist coefficient greater than one, then \widehat{t}(K)\ne 0. This generalizes a result of Plamenevskaya [PLA15] for classical braids.
