This survey article, in honor of G. Tian's 60th birthday, is inspired by R. Pandharipande's 2002 note highlighting research directions central to Gromov-Witten theory in algebraic geometry and by G. Tian's complex-geometric perspective on pseudoholomorphic curves that lies behind many important developments in symplectic topology since the early 1990s.
