Consider the restriction of an irreducible unitary representation \pi of a Lie group G to its subgroup H.   Kirillov's revolutionary idea on the orbit method suggests that the multiplicity of an irreducible H-module \nu occurring in the restriction \pi|_H could be read from the coadjoint action of H on O^G \cap pr^{-1}(O^H) provided \pi and \nu are "geometric quantizations" of a G-coadjoint orbit O^G and an H-coadjoint orbit O^H,respectively, where pr: \sqrt{-1} g^{\ast} \to \sqrt{-1} h^{\ast} is the projection dual to the inclusion h \subset g of Lie algebras. Such results were previously established by Kirillov, Corwin and Greenleaf for nilpotent Lie groups.   In this article, we highlight specific elliptic orbits O^G of a semisimple Lie group G corresponding to highest weight modules of scalar type. We prove that the Corwin--Greenleaf number \sharp(O^G \cap pr^{-1}(O^H))/H is either zero or one for any H-coadjoint orbit O^H, whenever (G,H) is a symmetric pair of holomorphic type. Furthermore, we determine the coadjoint orbits O^H with nonzero Corwin-Greenleaf number. Our results coincide with the prediction of the orbit philosophy, and can be seen as "classical limits" of the multiplicity-free branching laws of holomorphic discrete series representations (T.Kobayashi [Progr.Math.2007]).
