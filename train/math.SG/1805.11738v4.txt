We develop a Floer theoretical gluing technique and apply it to deal with the most generic singular fiber in the SYZ program, namely the product of a torus with the immersed two-sphere with a single nodal self-intersection. As an application, we construct immersed Lagrangians in \mathrm{Gr}(2,\mathbb{C}^n) and \mathrm{OG}(1,\mathbb{C}^5) and derive their SYZ mirrors. It recovers the Lie theoretical mirrors constructed by Rietsch. It also gives an effective way to compute stable disks (with non-trivial obstructions) bounded by immersed Lagrangians.
