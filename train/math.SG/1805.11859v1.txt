This is part I of a book on KAM theory. We start from basic symplectic geometry, review Darboux-Weinstein theorems action angle coordinates and their global obstructions. Then we explain the content of Kolmogorov's invariant torus theorem and make it more general allowing discussion of arbitrary invariant Lagrangian varieties over general Poisson algebras. We include it into the general problem of normal forms and group actions. We explain the iteration method used by Kolmogorov by giving a finite dimensional analog.   Part I explains in which context we apply the theory of Kolmogorov spaces which will form the core of Part II.
