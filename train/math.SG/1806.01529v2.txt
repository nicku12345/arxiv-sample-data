In this paper, we study the Gelfand--Cetlin systems and polytopes of the co-adjoint \mathrm{SO}(n)-orbits. We describe the face structure of Gelfand--Cetlin polytopes and iterated bundle structure of Gelfand--Cetlin fibers in terms of combinatorics on the ladder diagrams. Using this description, we classify all Lagrangian fibers.
