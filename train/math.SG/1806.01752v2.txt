We show that any two birational projective Calabi-Yau manifolds have isomorphic small quantum cohomology algebras after a certain change of Novikov rings. The key tool used is a version of an algebra called symplectic cohomology, which is constructed using Hamiltonian Floer cohomology. Morally, the idea of the proof is to show that both small quantum products are identical deformations of symplectic cohomology of some common open affine subspace. Part of the proof uses the fact that subvarieties of positive codimension are stably displaceable.
