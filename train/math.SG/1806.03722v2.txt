We define a refined Gromov-Witten disk potential of self-transverse monotone immersed Lagrangian surfaces in a symplectic 4-manifold as an element in a capped version of the Chekanov--Eliashberg dg-algebra of the singularity links of the double points (a collection of Legendrian Hopf links). We give a surgery formula that expresses the potential after smoothing a double point.   We study refined potentials of monotone immersed Lagrangian spheres in the complex projective plane and find monotone spheres that cannot be displaced from complex lines and conics by symplectomorphisms. We also derive general restrictions on sphere potentials using Legendrian lifts to the contact 5-sphere.
