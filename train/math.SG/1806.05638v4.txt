In this article we introduce and analyze in detail singular contact structures, with an emphasis on b^m-contact structures, which are tangent to a given smooth hypersurface Z and satisfy certain transversality conditions. These singular contact structures are determined by the kernel of non-smooth differential forms, called b^m-contact forms, having an associated critical hypersurface Z. We provide several constructions, prove local normal forms, and study the induced structure on the critical hypersurface. The topology of those are related to smooth contact structures through a desingularization technique. The problem of existence of b^m-contact structures on a given manifold is also tackled in this paper. We prove that a connected component of a convex hypersurface of a contact manifold can be realized as a connected component of the critical set of a b^m-contact structure. In particular, in the 3-dimensional case, this construction yields the existence of a generic set of surfaces Z such that the pair (M,Z) is a b^{2k}-contact manifold and Z is its critical hypersurface. As a consequence of the desingularization techniques in [GMW], we prove the existence of folded contact forms on any almost contact manifold.
