Under certain assumptions (such as weak exacteness or monotonicity) we show that splitting Lagrangians through cobordism has an energy cost and, from this cost being smaller than certain explicit bounds, we deduce some strong forms of rigidity of Lagrangian intersections. As a consequence, we construct some new pseudo-metrics and metrics on certain classes of Lagrangian submanifolds. We also fit these constructions in a more general setting, independent of Lagrangian cobordism. As a main technical tool, we develop aspects of the theory of (weakly) filtered A-infinity categories.
