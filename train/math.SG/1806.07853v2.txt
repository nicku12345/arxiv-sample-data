We prove some results about linking of Lagrangian tori in the symplectic vector space (\mathbb{R}^4, \omega). We show that certain enumerative counts of holomophic disks give useful information about linking. This enables us to prove, for example, that any two Clifford tori are unlinked in a strong sense. We extend work of Dimitroglou Rizell and Evans on linking of monotone Lagrangian tori to a class of non-monotone tori in \mathbb{R}^4 and also strengthen their conclusions in the monotone case in \mathbb{R}^4.
