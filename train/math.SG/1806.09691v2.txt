Let G be a compact and connected Lie group. The G-model functor maps the category of symplectic representations of closed subgroups of G to the category of exact Hamiltonian G-actions. Based on previous joint work with Y. Karshon, the restriction of this functor to the momentum proper subcategory on either side induces a bijection between the sets of isomorphism classes. This classifies all momentum proper exact Hamiltonian G-actions (of arbitrary complexity). As a special case, the momentum proper Hamiltonian G-actions on contractible manifolds are exactly the symplectic G-representations, up to isomorphism.
