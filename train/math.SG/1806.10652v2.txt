We construct a product on the Floer complex associated to a pair of Lagrangian cobordisms. More precisely, given three exact transverse Lagrangian cobordisms in the symplectization of a contact manifold, we define a map \mathfrak{m}_2 by a count of rigid pseudo-holomorphic disks with boundary on the cobordisms and having punctures asymptotic to intersection points and Reeb chords of the negative Legendrian ends of the cobordisms. More generally, to a (d+1)-tuple of exact transverse Lagrangian cobordisms we associate a map \mathfrak{m}_d such that the family (\mathfrak{m}_d)_{d\geq1} are A_\infty-maps. Finally, we extend the Ekholm-Seidel isomorphism to an A_\infty-morphism, giving in particular that it is a ring isomorphism.
