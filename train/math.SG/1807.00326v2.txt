Let M be a closed symplectic manifold of dimension 2n with non-ellipticity. We can define an almost K\"ahler structure on M by using the given symplectic form. Using Darboux coordinate charts, we deform the given almost K\"ahler structure on the universal covering of M to obtain a Lipschitz K\"ahler structure on the universal covering of M which is homotopy equivalent to the given almost K\"ahler structure. Analogous to Teleman's L^2-Hodge decomposition on PL manifolds or Lipschitz Riemannian manifolds, we give a L^2-Hodge decomposition theorem on the universal covering of M with respect to the Lipschitz K\"ahler metric. Using an argument of Gromov, we give a vanishing theorem for L^2 harmonic p-forms, p\not=n (resp. a non-vanishing theorem for L^2 harmonic n-forms) on the universal covering of M, then its signed Euler characteristic satisfies (-1)^n\chi(M)\geq0 (resp. (-1)^n\chi(M)>0). As an application, we show that the Chern-Hopf conjecture holds true in closed even dimensional Riemannian manifolds with nonpositive curvature (resp. strictly negative curvature), it gives a positive answer to a Yau's problem due to S. S. Chern and H. Hopf.
