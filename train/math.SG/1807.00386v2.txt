We introduce tame sc-Fredholm sections and slices of sc-Fredholm sections. A slice is a notion of subpolyfold that is compatible with the sc-Fredholm section and has finite locally constant codimension. We prove that the subspace of a tame polyfold that satisfies a transverse sc-smooth constraint in a finite dimensional smooth manifold is a slice of any tame sc-Fredholm section compatible with the constraint. Moreover, we prove that a sc-Fredholm section restricted to a slice is a tame sc-Fredholm section with a drop in Fredholm index given by the codimension of the slice. As a corollary, we obtain fiber products of tame sc-Fredholm sections. We describe applications to Gromov-Witten invariants, constructing the Piunikhin-Salamon-Schwarz maps for general closed symplectic manifolds, and avoiding sphere bubbles in moduli spaces of expected dimension 0 and 1.
