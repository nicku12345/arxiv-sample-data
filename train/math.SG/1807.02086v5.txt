We prove that symplectic cohomology for open convex symplectic manifolds is invariant when the symplectic form undergoes deformations which may be non-exact and non-compactly supported, provided one uses the correct local system of coefficients in Floer theory. As a sample application beyond the Liouville setup, we describe in detail the symplectic cohomology for disc bundles in the twisted cotangent bundle of surfaces, and we deduce existence results for periodic magnetic geodesics on surfaces. In particular, we show the existence of geometrically distinct orbits by exploiting properties of the BV-operator on symplectic cohomology.
