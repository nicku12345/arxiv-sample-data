We construct counterexamples to classical calculus facts such as the Inverse and Implicit Function Theorems in Scale Calculus -- a generalization of Multivariable Calculus to infinite dimensional vector spaces in which the reparameterization maps relevant to Symplectic Geometry are smooth. Scale Calculus is a cornerstone of Polyfold Theory, which was introduced by Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder as a broadly applicable tool for regularizing moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves. We show how the novel nonlinear scale-Fredholm notion in Polyfold Theory overcomes the lack of Implicit Function Theorems, by formally establishing an often implicitly used fact: The differentials of basic germs -- the local models for scale-Fredholm maps -- vary continuously in the space of bounded operators when the base point changes. We moreover demonstrate that this continuity holds only in specific coordinates, by constructing an example of a scale-diffeomorphism and scale-Fredholm map with discontinuous differentials. This justifies the high technical complexity in the foundations of Polyfold Theory.
