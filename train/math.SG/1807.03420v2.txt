Let (M,\xi) be a contact 3-manifold and T^2 \subset (M,\xi) a convex torus of a special type called a mixed torus. We prove a JSJ-type decomposition theorem for strong and exact symplectic fillings of (M,\xi) when (M,\xi) is cut along T^2. As an application we show the uniqueness of exact fillings when (M,\xi) is obtained by Legendrian surgery on a knot in (S^3,\xi_{std}) when the knot is stabilized both positively and negatively.
