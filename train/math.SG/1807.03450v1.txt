We construct symplectic groupoids integrating log-canonical Poisson structures on cluster varieties of type \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{X} over both the real and complex numbers. Extensions of these groupoids to the completions of the cluster varieties where cluster variables are allowed to vanish are also considered. In the real case, we construct source-simply-connected groupoids for the cluster charts via the Poisson spray technique of Crainic and M\u{a}rcu\c{t}. These groupoid charts and their analogues for the symplectic double and blow-up groupoids are glued by lifting the cluster mutations to groupoid comorphisms whose formulas are motivated by the Hamiltonian perspective of cluster mutations introduced by Fock and Goncharov.
