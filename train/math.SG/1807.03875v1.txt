Given a Hamiltonian system  (M,\omega, G,\mu)  where (M,\omega) is a symplectic manifold, G is a compact connected Lie group acting on (M,\omega) with moment map  \mu:M \rightarrow\mathfrak{g}^{*}, then one may construct the symplectic quotient (M//G, \omega_{red}) where M//G := \mu^{-1}(0)/G. Kirwan used the norm-square of the moment map, |\mu|^2, as a G-equivariant Morse function on M to derive formulas for the rational Betti numbers of M//G.   A real Hamiltonian system (M,\omega, G,\mu, \sigma, \phi)  is a Hamiltonian system along with a pair of involutions (\sigma:M \rightarrow M, \phi:G \rightarrow G)  satisfying certain compatibility conditions. These imply that the fixed point set M^{\sigma} is a Lagrangian submanifold of (M,\omega) and that M^{\sigma}//G^{\phi} := (\mu^{-1}(0) \cap M^{\sigma})/G^{\phi} is a Lagrangian submanifold of (M//G, \omega_{red}). In this paper we prove analogues of Kirwan's Theorems that can be used to calculate the \mathbb{Z}_2-Betti numbers of M^{\sigma}//G^{\phi} . In particular, we prove (under appropriate hypotheses) that |\mu|^2 restricts to a G^{\phi}-equivariantly perfect Morse-Kirwan function on M^{\sigma} over \mathbb{Z}_2 coefficients, describe its critical set using explicit real Hamiltonian subsystems, prove equivariant formality for G^{\phi} acting on M^{\sigma}, and combine these results to produce formulas for the \mathbb{Z}_2-Betti numbers of M^{\sigma}//G^{\phi}.
