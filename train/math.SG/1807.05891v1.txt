We construct an infinite dimensional Lie rackoid Y which hosts an integration of the standard Courant algebroid. As a set, Y = C \infty ([0, 1], T * M) for a compact manifold M. The rackoid product is by automorphisms of the Dorfman bracket. The first part of the article is a study of the Lie rackoid Y and its tangent Leibniz algebroid a quotient of which is the standard Courant algebroid. In a second part, we study the equivalence relation related to the quotient on the rackoid level and restrict then to an integrable Dirac structure. We show how our integrating object contains the corresponding integrating Weinstein Lie groupoid in the case where the Dirac structure is given by a Poisson structure.
