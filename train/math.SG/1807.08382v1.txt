In this note, we examine the bundle picture of the pullback construction of Lie algebroids. The notion of submersions by Lie algebroids is introduced, which leads to a new proof of the local normal form for lie algebroid transversals of [Bursztyn et al., Crelle, 2017], and which we use to deduce that Lie algebroids transversals concentrate all local cohomology.   The locally trivial version of submersions by Lie algebroids \mathfrak{S} is then discussed, and we show that this notion is equivalent to the existence of a complete Ehresmann connection for \mathfrak{S}, extending the main result in [del Hoyo, Indag. Math. 2016].   Finally, we show that locally trivial version of submersions by Lie algebroids gives rise to a system of local coefficients, which is an integral part of a version of the homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology in the context of Lie algebroids, and we apply such local systems to extend the localization theorem of [Chen et al. 2006].
