We study Lie algebras of type I, that is, a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} where all the eigenvalues of the operator ad_X are imaginary for all X\in \mathfrak{g}. We prove that the Morse-Novikov cohomology of a Lie algebra of type I is trivial for any closed 1-form. We focus on locally conformal symplectic structures (LCS) on Lie algebras of type I. In particular we show that for a Lie algebra of type I any LCS structure is of the first kind. We also exhibit lattices for some 6-dimensional Lie groups of type I admitting left invariant LCS structures in order to produce compact solvmanifolds equipped with an invariant LCS structure.
