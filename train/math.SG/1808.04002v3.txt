In a series of papers on Bohr-Sommerfeld-Heisenberg quantization of completely integrable systems we interpreted shifting operators as quantization of functions {\mathrm{e}}^{ \pm i{\theta}_j} , where (I_j , {\theta}_j ) are action angle coordinates. The aim of this paper is to show how these operators occur in geometric quantization.
