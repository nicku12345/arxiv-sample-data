The purpose of this article is to study co-dimension 2 iso-contact embeddings of closed contact manifolds. We first show that a closed contact manifold (M^{2n-1}, \xi_M) iso-contact embeds in a contact manifold (N^{2n+1}, \xi_N), provided M contact embeds in (N, \xi_N) with a trivial normal bundle and the contact structure induced on M via this embedding is homotopic as an almost-contact structure to \xi_M. We apply this result to first establish that a closed contact 3--manifold having no 2--torsion in its second integral cohomology iso-contact embeds in the standard contact 5--sphere if and only if the first Chern class of the contact structure is zero. Finally, we discuss iso-contact embeddings of closed simply connected contact 5--manifolds.
