We prove an existence h-principle for regular Lagrangians with Legendrian boundary in arbitrary Weinstein domains of dimension at least six; this extends a previous result of Eliashberg, Ganatra, and the author for Lagrangians in flexible domains. Furthermore, we show that all regular Lagrangians come from our construction and describe some related decomposition results. We also prove a regular version of Eliashberg and Murphy's h-principle for Lagrangian caps with loose negative end. As an application, we give a new construction of infinitely many regular Lagrangian disks in the standard Weinstein ball.
