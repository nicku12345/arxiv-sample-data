Associated to a symplectic quotient M/\!/G is a Lagrangian correspondence \Lambda_G from M/\!/G to M. In this note, we construct in two examples quilts with seam condition on such a correspondence, in the case of S^1 acting on \mathbb{CP}^2 with symplectic quotient \mathbb{CP}^2/\!/ S^1 = \mathbb{CP}^1. First, we study the quilted strips that would, if not for figure eight bubbling, identify the Floer chain groups CF(\gamma,S_{\text{Cl}}^1) and CF(\mathbb{RP}^2,T_{\text{Cl}}^2), where \gamma is the connected double-cover of \mathbb{RP}^1. Second, we answer a question due to Akveld-Cannas da Silva-Wehrheim by explicitly producing a figure eight bubble which obstructs an isomorphism between two Floer chain groups. The figure eight bubbles we construct in this paper are the first concrete examples of this phenomenon.
