We present a reduction procedure for locally conformally symplectic (LCS) manifolds with an action of a Lie group preserving the conformal structure, with respect to any regular value of the momentum mapping. Under certain conditions, this reduction is compatible with the existence of a locally conformally K\"ahler structure. As a special consequence, we obtain a compatible contact reduction with respect to any regular value of the contact momentum mapping.
