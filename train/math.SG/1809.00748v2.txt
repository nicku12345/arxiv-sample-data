We construct a densely defined torus action on the symplectic quotient of the product of three complete flag varieties. The closure of the image of the corresponding moment map is a convex polytope. The dimension of the geometric quantization of this space gives the structure constants of the representation ring of SU(n), which we show is given by counting lattice points in the image of the moment map. Such lattice point formulas for the structure constants were given by Berenstein-Zelevinsky; our results show how such formulas arise geometrically as an example of `invariance of polarization', analogous to the description of the Gelfand-Cetlin polytopes by Guillemin-Sternberg. We outline applications to loop groups and to moduli spaces of vector bundles.
