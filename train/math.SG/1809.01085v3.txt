We construct a family version of symplectic Floer cohomology for magnetic cotangent bundles, without any restrictions on the magnetic form, using the dissipative method for compactness introduced in \cite{Groman2015}. As an application, we deduce that if N is a closed manifold and  \sigma is a magnetic form that is not weakly exact, then the  \pi_1-sensitive Hofer-Zehnder capacity of any compact set in the magnetic cotangent bundle determined by  \sigma is finite.
