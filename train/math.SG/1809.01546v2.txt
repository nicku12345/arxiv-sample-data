We provide explicit formulas for integrating multiplicative forms on local Lie groupoids in terms of infinitesimal data. Combined with our previous work [8], which constructs the local Lie groupoid of a Lie algebroid, these formulas produce concrete integrations of several geometric stuctures defined infinitesimally. In particular, we obtain local integrations and non-degenerate realizations of Poisson, Nijenhuis-Poisson, Dirac, and Jacobi structures by local symplectic, symplectic-Nijenhuis, presymplectic, and contact groupoids, respectively.
