We propose a new method to compute asymptotics of periods using tropical geometry, in which the Riemann zeta values appear naturally as error terms in tropicalization. Our method suggests how the Gamma class should arise from the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture. We use it to give a new proof of (a version of) the Gamma Conjecture for Batyrev pairs of mirror Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.
