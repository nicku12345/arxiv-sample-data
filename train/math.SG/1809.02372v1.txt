For a symplectic twist map, we prove that there is a choice of weak K.A.M. solutions that depend in a continuous way on the cohomology class. We thus obtain a continuous function u(\theta, c) in two variables: the angle \theta and the cohomology class c. As a result, we prove that the Aubry-Mather sets are contained in pseudographs that are vertically ordered by their rotation numbers. Then we characterize the C^0 integrable twist maps in terms of regularity of u that allows to see u as a generating function. We also obtain some results for the Lipschitz integrable twist maps. With an example, we show that our choice is not the so-called discounted one (see \cite{DFIZ2}), that is sometimes discontinuous. We also provide examples of `strange' continuous foliations that cannot be straightened by a symplectic homeomorphism.
