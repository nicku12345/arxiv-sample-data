Given two 4-dimensional ellipsoids whose symplectic sizes satisfy a specified inequality, we prove that a certain loop of symplectic embeddings between the two ellipsoids is noncontractible. The statement about symplectic ellipsoids is a particular case of a more general result. Given two convex toric domains whose first and second ECH capacities satisfy a specified inequality, we prove that a certain loop of symplectic embeddings between the two convex toric domains is noncontractible. We show how the constructed loops become contractible if the target domain becomes large enough. The proof involves studying certain moduli spaces of holomorphic cylinders in families of symplectic cobordisms arising from families of symplectic embeddings.
