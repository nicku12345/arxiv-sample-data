Mirror symmetry for a toric variety involves Laurent polynomials whose symplectic topology is related to the algebraic geometry of the toric variety. We show that there is a monodromy action on the monomially admissible Fukaya-Seidel categories of these Laurent polynomials as the arguments of their coefficients vary that corresponds under homological mirror symmetry to tensoring by a line bundle naturally associated to the monomials whose coefficients are rotated. In the process, we introduce the monomially admissible Fukaya-Seidel category as a new interpretation of the Fukaya-Seidel category of a Laurent polynomial on (\mathbb{C}^*)^n, which has other potential applications, and give evidence of homological mirror symmetry for non-compact toric varieties.
