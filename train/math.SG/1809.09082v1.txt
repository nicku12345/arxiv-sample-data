The purpose of this paper is to apply deformation quantization to the study of the coadjoint orbit method in the case of real reductive groups. We first prove some general results on the existence of equivariant deformation quantization of vector bundles on closed Lagrangian subvarieties, which lie in smooth symplectic varieties with Hamiltonian group actions. Then we apply them to orbit method and construct nontrivial irreducible Harish-Chandra modules for certain coadjoint orbits. Our examples include new geometric construction of representations associated to certain orbits of real exceptional Lie groups.
