We study holomorphic Legendrian curves in the standard complex contact structure on the projectivised cotangent bundle X=\mathbb P(T^*Z) of a complex manifold Z of dimension at least 2. We provide a detailed analysis of Legendrian curves degenerating to vertical curves and obtain several approximation and general position theorems. In particular, we prove that any vertical holomorphic curve M\to X from a compact bordered Riemann surface M can be deformed to a horizontal Legendrian curve by an arbitrarily small deformation. A similar result is proved in the parametric setting, provided that all vertical curves under consideration are nondegenerate. Stronger results are obtained when the base Z is an Oka manifold or a Stein manifold with the density property. Finally, we establish basic and 1-parametric h-principles for holomorphic Legendrian curves in X.
