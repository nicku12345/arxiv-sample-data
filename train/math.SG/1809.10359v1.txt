Nadler introduced certain Lagrangian singularities indexed by trees, and determined their microlocal sheaves to be the category of modules over the corresponding tree quiver. Another family of spaces indexed by trees: the tree plumbings of spheres. The Fukaya-Seidel category of the Lefschetz fibration with this plumbing as fiber and all spheres as vanishing cycles is well known to also be modules over the tree quiver. Here we upgrade this matching of categories to a matching of geometry.
