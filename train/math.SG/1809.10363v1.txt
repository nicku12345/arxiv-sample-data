We classify symplectically foliated fillings of certain contact foliated manifolds. We show that up to symplectic deformation, the unique minimal symplectically foliated filling of the foliated sphere cotangent bundle of the Reeb foliation in the 3-sphere is the associated disk cotangent bundle. En route to the proof, we study another foliated manifold, namely the product of a circle and an annulus with almost horizontal foliation. In this case, the foliated unit cotangent bundle does not have a unique minimal symplectic filling. We classify the foliated fillings of this manifold up to symplectic deformation equivalence using combinatorial invariants of the filling.
