Let a contact 3-manifold (Y, \xi_0) be the link of a normal surface singularity equipped with its canonical contact structure \xi_0. We prove a special property of such contact 3-manifolds of "algebraic" origin: the Heegaard Floer invariant c^+(\xi_0)\in HF^+(-Y) cannot lie in the image of the U-action on HF^+(-Y). It follows that Karakurt's "height of U-tower" invariants are always 0 for canonical contact structures on singularity links, which contrasts the fact that the height of U-tower can be arbitrary for general fillable contact structures. Our proof uses the interplay between the Heegaard Floer homology and N\'emethi's lattice cohomology.
