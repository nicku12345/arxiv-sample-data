We give a detailed, self-contained proof of Geoffrey Martin's normal form theorem for Lagrangian submanifolds of standard multisymplectic manifolds (that generalises Alan Weinstein's famous normal form theorem in symplectic geometry), providing also complete proofs for the necessary results in foliated differential topology, i.e., a foliated tubular neighborhood theorem and a foliated relative Poincar\'e lemma.
