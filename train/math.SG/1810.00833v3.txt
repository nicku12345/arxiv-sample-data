We show that a monotone Lagrangian L in \mathbb{CP}^n of minimal Maslov number n + 1 is homeomorphic to a double quotient of a sphere, and thus homotopy equivalent to \mathbb{RP}^n. To prove this we use Zapolsky's canonical pearl complex for L with coefficients in \mathbb{Z}, and various twisted versions thereof, where the twisting is determined by connected covers of L. The main tool is the action of the quantum cohomology of \mathbb{CP}^n on the resulting Floer homologies.
