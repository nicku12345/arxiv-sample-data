In an earlier article we introduced a new definition for the `quantization' of a Hamiltonian loop group space \mathcal{M}, involving the equivariant L^2-index of a Dirac-type operator \mathscr{D} on a non-compact finite dimensional submanifold \mathcal{Y} of \mathcal{M}. In this article we study a Witten-type deformation of this operator, similar to the work of Tian-Zhang and Ma-Zhang. We obtain a formula for the index with infinitely many non-trivial contributions, indexed by the components of the critical set of the norm-square of the moment map. This is the main part of a new proof of the [Q,R]=0 theorem for Hamiltonian loop group spaces.
