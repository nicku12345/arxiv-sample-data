We relate the quantum Steenrod square to Seidel's equivariant pair-of-pants product for open convex symplectic manifolds that are either monotone or exact, using an equivariant version of the PSS isomorphism. We proceed similarly for \mathbb{Z}/2-equivariant symplectic cohomology, using an equivariant version of the continuation and c^*-maps. We prove a symplectic Cartan relation, pointing out the difficulties in stating it. We give a nonvanishing result for the equivariant pair-of-pants product for some elements of SH^*(T^* S^n). We finish by calculating the symplectic square for the negative line bundles M = \text{Tot}(\mathcal{O}(-1) \rightarrow \mathbb{CP}^m), proving an equivariant version of a result due to Ritter.
