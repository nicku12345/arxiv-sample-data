We correct a mistake regarding almost complex structures on Hilbert schemes of points in surfaces in arXiv:1510.02449. The error does not affect the main results of the paper, and only affects the proofs of invariance of equivariant symplectic Khovanov homology and reduced symplectic Khovanov homology. We give an alternate proof of the invariance of equivariant symplectic Khovanov homology.
