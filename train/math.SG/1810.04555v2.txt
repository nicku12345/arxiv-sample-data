We consider the deformation theory of two kinds of geometric objects: foliations on one hand, pre-symplectic forms on the other. For each of them, we prove that the geometric notion of equivalence given by isotopies agrees with the algebraic notion of gauge equivalence obtained from the L_{\infty}-algebras governing these deformation problems.
