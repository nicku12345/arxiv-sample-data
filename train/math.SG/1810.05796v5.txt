We show that a hypersurface of the regularized, spatial circular restricted three-body problem is of contact type whenever the energy level is below the first critical value (the energy level of the first Lagrange point) or if the energy level is slightly above it. A dynamical consequence is that there is no blue sky catastrophe in this energy range.
