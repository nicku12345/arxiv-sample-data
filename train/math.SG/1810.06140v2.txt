Consider the holomorphic Hamiltonian action of a compact Lie group K on a compact K\"ahler manifold M with a moment map \Phi: M\rightarrow \mathfrak{k}^*. Assume that 0 is a regular value of the moment map. Weitsman raised the question of what we can say about the cohomology of the K\"ahler quotient M_0:=\Phi^{-1}(0)/K if all the ordinary cohomology of M is of type (p, p).   In this paper, using the Cartan-Chern-Weil theory we show that in the above context there is a natural surjective Kirwan map from an equivariant version of the Dolbeault cohomology of M onto the Dolbeault cohomology of the K\"ahler quotient M_0. As an immediate consequence, this result provides an answer to the question posed by Weitsman.
