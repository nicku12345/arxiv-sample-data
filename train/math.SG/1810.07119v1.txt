To a symplectic Lefschetz pencil on a monotone symplectic manifold, we associate an algebraic structure, which is a pencil of categories in the sense of noncommutative geometry. One fibre of this "noncommutative pencil" is related to the Fukaya category of the open (meaning, with the base locus removed, and hence exact symplectic) fibre of the original Lefschetz pencil; the other fibres are newly constructed kinds of Fukaya categories.
