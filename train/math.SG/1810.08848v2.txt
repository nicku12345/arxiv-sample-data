In the present work, we study Hamiltonian systems on (co)adjoint orbits and propose a new approach for Gelfand-Tsetlin integrable systems via Lax pairs. As an application of this approach, we introduce a family of hyperelliptic curves which encodes the Gelfand-Tsetlin integrable systems as branch points. Using this family of algebraic curves, we explore some new insights into the relationship between singular fibers of the Gelfand-Tsetlin integrable systems and vanishing cycles of algebraic curves.
