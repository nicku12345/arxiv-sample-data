In this paper, we investigate the structure of the convergent quantization of the 1-shifted cotangent bundle S of a smooth scheme X over a perfect field of positive characteristic. The quantization is an E_2-algebra over the Frobenius twist S' of the 1-shifted cotangent bundle which restricted to the zero section X'\rightarrow S' is weakly E_2-Morita equivalent to the structure sheaf \mathscr O_{X'} of the Frobenius twist X' of X.   Explicitly, we show that the (\infty,2)-category of coherent (left-)modules over \mathscr O_{X'} is equivalent to the full subcategory of the (\infty,2)-category of coherent category of (left-)modules over the quantization restricted to the zero section generated by \mathscr O_X are equivalent.
