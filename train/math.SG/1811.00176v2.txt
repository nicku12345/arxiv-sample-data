We introduce group actions on polyfolds and polyfold bundles. We prove quotient theorems for polyfolds, when the group action has finite isotropy. We prove that the sc-Fredholm property is preserved under quotient if the base polyfold is infinite dimensional. The quotient construction is the main technical tool in the construction of equivariant fundamental class in [42]. We also analyze the equivariant transversality near the fixed locus in the polyfold setting. In the case of S^1-action with fixed locus, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of equivariant transverse perturbations. We outline the application to Hamiltonian-Floer cohomology and a proof of the weak Arnold conjecture for general symplectic manifolds, assuming the existence of Hamiltonian-Floer cohomology polyfolds.
