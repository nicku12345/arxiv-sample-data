Questions of geography of various classes of 4-manifolds have been a central motivating question in 4-manifold topology. Baykur and Korkmaz asked which small, simply connected, minimal 4-manifolds admit a genus 2 Lefschetz fibration. They were able to classify all the possible homeomorphism types and realize all but one with the exception of a genus 2 Lefschetz fibration on a symplectic 4-manifold homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic to 3 \mathbb{CP}^2 \# 11\overline{\mathbb{CP}}^2. We give a positive factorization of type (10,10) that corresponds to such a genus 2 Lefschetz fibration. Furthermore, we observe two restrictions on the geography of genus 2 Lefschetz fibrations, we find that they satisfy the Noether inequality and a BMY like inequality. We then find positive factorizations that describe genus 2 Lefschetz fibrations on simply connected, minimal symplectic 4-manifolds for many of these points.
