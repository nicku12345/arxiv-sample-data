In previous work of Cristofaro-Gardiner, Frenkel, and Schlenk, the embedding function c_b(a) describing the problem of symplectically embedding an ellipsoid E(1,a) into the smallest scaling of the polydisc P(1,b) was determined for all integers b \geq 2. As in McDuff's work, Cristofaro-Gardiner, Frenkel, and Schlenk found staircases associated with the embedding function. More recently, Usher's work shows that the appearance of infinite staircases as b varies is hard to predict. The intricate structure found there suggests that determining the entirety of the graph of c_b(a) for all b is intractable.   In contrast with this result, we show that for every polydisc P(1,b) with b>2, there is an explicit formula for the minimum a such that the embedding problem is determined only by volume. That is, when the ellipsoid is sufficiently stretched, there is a symplectic embedding of E(1,a) fully filling an appropriately scaled polydisc P(\lambda,\lambda b). We call this value of a the rigid-flexible value at b, or the RF-value. This formula is piecewise smooth in b.   To further describe the function RF(b), we investigate its behavior as b\to 1. Frenkel and M\"{u}ller showed that the RF-value at b=1 is 7 \frac{1}{32} and Cristofaro-Gardiner, Frenkel, and Schlenk showed that the RF-value at b=2 is 8 \frac{1}{36}. By exhibiting a sequence of obstructive classes for b = \frac{n+1}{n} at a=8, in combination with the Frenkel-M\"{u}ller result, we show that RF is discontinuous at b=1.
