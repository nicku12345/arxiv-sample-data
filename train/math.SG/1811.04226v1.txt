Poisson structures of divisor-type are those whose degeneracy can be captured by a divisor ideal, which is a locally principal ideal sheaf with nowhere-dense quotient support. This is a large class of Poisson structures which includes all generically-nondegenerate Poisson structures, such as log-, b^k-, elliptic, elliptic-log, and scattering Poisson structures. Divisor ideals are used to define almost-injective Lie algebroids of derivations preserving them, to which these Poisson structures can be lifted, often nondegenerately so. The resulting symplectic Lie algebroids can be studied using tools from symplectic geometry. In this paper we develop an effective framework for the study of Poisson structures of divisor-type (also called almost-regular Poisson structures) and their Lie algebroids. We provide lifting criteria for such Poisson structures, develop the language of divisors on smooth manifolds, and discuss residue maps to extract information from Lie algebroid forms along their degeneraci loci.
