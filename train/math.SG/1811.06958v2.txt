We study the almost Kaehler geometry of adjoint orbits of non-compact real semisimple Lie groups endowed with the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form and a canonically defined almost complex structure. We give explicit formulas for the Chern-Ricci form, the Hermitian scalar curvature and the Nijenhuis tensor in terms of root data. We also discuss when the Chern-Ricci form is a multiple of the symplectic form, and when compact quotients of these orbits are of Kaehler type.
