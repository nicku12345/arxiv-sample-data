We prove some open book embedding results in the contact category. For example, we show that a large class of contact 3-manifolds admit contact open book embedding in the standard contact 5- sphere. We also prove that all the Ustilovsky (4m + 1)-spheres contact open book embed in the standard contact (4m + 3)-sphere.
