The aim of this article is to apply a Floer theory to study symmetric periodic Reeb orbits. We define positive equivariant wrapped Floer homology using a (anti-)symplectic involution on a Liouville domain and investigate its algebraic properties. By a careful analysis of index iterations, we obtain a non-trivial lower bound on the minimal number of geometrically distinct symmetric periodic Reeb orbits on a certain class of real contact manifolds. This includes non-degenerate real dynamically convex starshaped hypersurfaces in \mathbb{R}^{2n} which are invariant under complex conjugation. As a result, we give a partial answer to the Seifert conjecture on brake orbits in the contact setting.
