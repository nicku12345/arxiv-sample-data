By examining knot Floer homology, we extend a result of Ozsv\'ath and Stipsicz and show further infinitely many Legendrian and transversely non-simple knot types among two-bridge knots. We give sufficient conditions of Legendrian and transverse non-simplicity on the continued fraction expansion of the corresponding rational number.
