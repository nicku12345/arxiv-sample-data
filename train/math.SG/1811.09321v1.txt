Here we extend the notion of target-local Gromov convergence of pseudoholomorphic curves to the case in which the target manifold is not compact, but rather is exhausted by compact neighborhoods. Under the assumption that the curves in question have uniformly bounded area and genus on each of the compact regions (but not necessarily global bounds), we prove a subsequence converges in an exhaustive Gromov sense.
