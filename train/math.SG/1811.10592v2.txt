It is shown that there is a useful notion of a relative Bridgeland stability condition on the partially wrapped Fukaya category of a marked surface, relative to some part of the surface's boundary. This construction has nice functorial properties, obeying cutting and gluing relations. This reduces the calculation of stability conditions on the Fukaya category of any fully stopped surface into three types of base cases. Calculations of these cases shows that every Bridgeland stability condition on such categories can be described by flat surfaces. In other words, the map constructed by Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich from the moduli of flat surfaces to the stability space of the Fukaya category is a global homeomorphism when the surface is fully stopped.
