We prove that, for a C^\infty-generic contact form \lambda adapted to a given contact distribution on a closed three-manifold, there exists a sequence of periodic Reeb orbits which is equidistributed with respect to d\lambda. This is a quantitative refinement of the C^\infty-generic density theorem for three-dimensional Reeb flows, which was previously proved by the author. The proof is based on the volume theorem in embedded contact homology (ECH) by Cristofaro-Gardiner, Hutchings, Ramos, and inspired by the argument of Marques-Neves-Song, who proved a similar equidistribution result for minimal hypersurfaces. We also discuss a question about generic behavior of periodic Reeb orbits "representing" ECH homology classes, and give a partial affirmative answer to a toy model version of this question which concerns boundaries of star-shaped toric domains.
