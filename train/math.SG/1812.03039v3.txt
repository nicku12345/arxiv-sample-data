We study some particular cases of Viterbo's conjecture relating volumes of convex bodies and actions of closed characteristics on their boundaries, focusing on the case of a Hamiltonian of classical mechanical type, splitting into summands depending on the coordinates and the momentum separately. We manage to establish the conjecture for sublevel sets of convex 2-homogeneous Hamiltonians of this kind in several particular cases. We also discuss open cases of this conjecture.
