In this survey article, we describe imploded cross-sections, which were developed in order to solve the problem that the cross-section of a Hamiltonian K-space is usually not symplectic. In some specific examples we contrast the intersection homology of some imploded cross-sections with their homology intersection spaces.   Moreover, we compute the homology of intersection spaces associated to the open cone of a simply connected, smooth, oriented manifold and the suspension of such a manifold.
