Mironov, Panov and Kotelskiy studied Hamiltonian-minimal Lagrangians inside \mathbb{C}^n. They associated a closed embedded Lagrangian L to each Delzant polytope P. In this paper we develop their ideas and prove that L is monotone if and only if the polytope P is Fano.   In some examples, we further compute the minimal Maslov numbers. Namely, let \mathcal{N}\to T^k be some fibration over the k-dimensional torus with a fiber equal to either S^k \times S^l, or S^k \times S^l \times S^m, or \#_5(S^{2p-1} \times S^{n-2p-2}). We construct monotone Lagrangian embeddings \mathcal{N} \subset \mathbb{C}^n with different minimal Maslov number, and therefore distinct up to Lagrangian isotopy. Moreover, we show that some of our embeddings are smoothly isotopic but not Lagrangian isotopic.
