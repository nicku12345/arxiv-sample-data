We provide an inductive algorithm to compute the bulk-deformed potentials for toric Fano surfaces via wall-crossing techniques and a tropical-holomorphic correspondence theorem for holomorphic discs. As an application of the correspondence theorem, we also prove a big quantum period theorem for toric Fano surfaces which relates the log descendant Gromov-Witten invariants with the oscillatory integrals of the bulk-deformed potentials.
