We construct symplectic structures on roughly half of all equal rank biquotients of the form G//T, where G is a compact simple Lie group and T a torus, and investigate Hamiltonian Lie group actions on them. For the Eschenburg flag, this action has similar properties as Tolman's and Woodward's examples of Hamiltonian non-K\"ahler actions. In addition to the previously known K\"ahler structure on the Eschenburg flag, we find another K\"ahler structure on a biquotient \mathrm{SU}(4)//T^3.
