Using a simplified version of Kuranishi perturbation theory that we call semi-global Kuranishi structures, we give a definition of the equivariant Lagrangian Floer cohomology of a pair of Lagrangian submanifolds that are fixed under a finite symplectic group action and satisfy certain simplifying assumptions.
