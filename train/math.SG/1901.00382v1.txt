I study a special type of canonical relations given by twisted conormal bundles, construct a "subcategory" of the symplectic "category" out of these canonical relations and quantize them into semi-classical Fourier integral operators. Furthermore, I give a description of the intrinsic line bundle of symbols of these operators and describe how the symbols compose when the operators compose.
