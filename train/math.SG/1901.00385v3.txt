We show that Spaltenstein varieties of classical groups are pure dimensional when the Jordan type of the nilpotent element involved is an even or odd partition. We further show that they are Lagrangian in the partial resolutions of the associated nilpotent Slodowy slices, from which their dimensions are known to be one half of the dimension of the partial resolution minus the dimension of the nilpotent orbit. The results are then extended to the \sigma-quiver-variety setting.
