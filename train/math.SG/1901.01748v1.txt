Gamma conjecture I and the underlying Conjecture \mathcal{O} for Fano manifolds were proposed by Galkin, Golyshev and Iritani recently. We show that both conjectures hold for all two-dimensional Fano manifolds. We prove Conjecture \mathcal{O} by deriving a generalized Perron-Frobenius theorem on eigenvalues of real matrices and a vanishing result of certain Gromov-Witten invariants for del Pezzo surfaces. We prove Gamma conjecture I by applying mirror techniques proposed by Galkin-Iritani together with the study of Gamma conjecture I for weighted projective spaces.
