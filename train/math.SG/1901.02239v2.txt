This is the first of a series of two articles where we construct a version of wrapped Fukaya category \mathcal W\mathcal F(M\setminus K;H_{g_0}) of the cotangent bundle T^*(M \setminus K) of the knot complement M \setminus K of a compact 3-manifold M, and do some calculation for the case of hyperbolic knots K \subset M. For the construction, we use the wrapping induced by the kinetic energy Hamiltonian H_{g_0} associated to the cylindrical adjustment g_0 on M \setminus K of a smooth metric g defined on M. We then consider the torus T = \partial N(K) as an object in this category and its wrapped Floer complex CW^*(\nu^*T;H_{g_0}) where N(K) is a tubular neighborhood of K \subset M. We prove that the quasi-equivalence class of the category and the quasi-isomorphism class of the A_\infty algebra CW^*(\nu^*T;H_{g_0}) are independent of the choice of cylindrical adjustments of such metrics depending only on the isotopy class of the knot K in M. In a sequel [BKO], we give constructions of a wrapped Fukaya category \mathcal W\mathcal F(M\setminus K;H_h) for hyperbolic knot K and of A_\infty algebra CW^*(\nu^*T;H_h) directly using the hyperbolic metric h on M \setminus K, and prove a formality result for the asymptotic boundary of (M \setminus K, h).
