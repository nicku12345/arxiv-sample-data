This is a sequel to the authors' article [BKO](arXiv:1901.02239). We consider a hyperbolic knot K in a closed 3-manifold M and the cotangent bundle of its complement M \setminus K. We equip M \setminus K with a hyperbolic metric h and its cotangent bundle T^*(M \setminus K) with the induced kinetic energy Hamiltonian H_h = \frac{1}{2} |p|_h^2 and Sasakian almost complex structure J_h, and associate a wrapped Fukaya category to T^*(M\setminus K) whose wrapping is given by H_h. We then consider the conormal \nu^*T of a horo-torus T as its object. We prove that all non-constant Hamiltonian chords are transversal and of Morse index 0 relative to the horo-torus T, and so that the structure maps satisfy \widetilde{\mathfrak m}^k = 0 unless k \neq 2 and an A_\infty-algebra associated to \nu^*T is reduced to a noncommutative algebra concentrated to degree 0. We prove that the wrapped Floer cohomology HW(\nu^*T; H_h) with respect to H_h is well-defined and isomorphic to the Knot Floer cohomology HW(\partial_\infty(M \setminus K)) that was introduced in [BKO] for arbitrary knot K \subset M. We also define a reduced cohomology, denoted by \widetilde{HW}^d(\partial_\infty(M \setminus K)), by modding out constant chords and prove that if \widetilde{HW}^d(\partial_\infty(M \setminus K))\neq 0 for some d \geq 1, then K cannot be hyperbolic. On the other hand, we prove that all torus knots have \widetilde{HW}^1(\partial_\infty(M \setminus K)) \neq 0.
