We consider a smooth submanifold N with a smooth boundary in an ambient closed manifold M and assign a spectral invariant c(\alpha,H) to every singular homological class \alpha\in H_*(N) and a Hamiltonian H defined on the cotangent bundle T^*M. We also derive certain properties of spectral numbers, for example we prove that spectral invariants c_\pm(H,N) associated to the whole Floer homology HF_*(H,N:M) of the submanifold N, are limits of the decreasing nested family of open sets.
