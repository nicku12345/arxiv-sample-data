By a result due to Ziltener, there exist no closed embedded Bohr-Sommerfeld Lagrangians inside \mathbb CP^n for the prequantisation bundle whose total space is the standard contact sphere. On the other hand, any embedded monotone Lagrangian torus has a canonical nontrivial cover which is a Bohr-Sommerfeld immersion. We draw the front projections for the corresponding Legendrian lifts inside a contact Darboux ball of the threefold covers of both the two-dimensional Clifford and Chekanov tori (the former is the Legendrian link of the Harvey-Lawson special Lagrangian cone), and compute the associated Chekanov-Eliashberg algebras. Although these Legendrians are not loose, we show that they both admit exact Lagrangian cobordisms to the loose Legendrian sphere; they hence admit exact Lagrangian caps in the symplectisation, which are non-regular Lagrangian cobordisms. Along the way, we also compute bilinearised Legendrian contact homology of a general Legendrian surface in the standard contact vector space when all Reeb chords are of positive degree, as well as the augmentation variety in the case of tori.
