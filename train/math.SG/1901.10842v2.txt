Consider a closed non-degenerate 3-form \omega with an infinitesimal action of a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. Motivated by the fact that the observables associated to \omega form a Lie 2-algebra, we introduce homotopy moment maps defined on a Lie 2-algebra rather than just on the Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}.   We formulate existence criteria and provide a construction for such homotopy moment maps, by characterizing them in terms of cohomology.
