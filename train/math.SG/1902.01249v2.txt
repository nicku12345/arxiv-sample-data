Let \alpha be a contact form on a connected closed three-manifold \Sigma. The systolic ratio of \alpha is defined as \rho_{\mathrm{sys}}(\alpha):=\tfrac{1}{\mathrm{Vol}(\alpha)}T_{\min}(\alpha)^2, where T_{\min}(\alpha) and \mathrm{Vol}(\alpha) denote the minimal period of periodic Reeb orbits and the contact volume. The form \alpha is said to be Zoll if its Reeb flow generates a free S^1-action on \Sigma. We prove that the set of Zoll contact forms on \Sigma locally maximises the systolic ratio in the C^3-topology. More precisely, we show that every Zoll form \alpha_* admits a C^3-neighbourhood \mathcal U in the space of contact forms such that, for every \alpha\in\mathcal U, there holds \rho_{\mathrm{sys}}(\alpha)\leq \rho_{\mathrm{sys}}(\alpha_*) with equality if and only if \alpha is Zoll.
