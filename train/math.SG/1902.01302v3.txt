We prove that a real Lagrangian submanifold in a closed symplectic manifold is unique up to cobordism. We then discuss the classification of real Lagrangians in \mathbb{C} P^2 and S^2\times S^2. In particular, we show that a real Lagrangian in \mathbb{C} P^2 is unique up to Hamiltonian isotopy and that a real Lagrangian in S^2\times S^2 is either Hamiltonian isotopic to the antidialgonal sphere or Lagrangian isotopic to the Clifford torus.
