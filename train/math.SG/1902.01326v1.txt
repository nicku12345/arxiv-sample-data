We prove that for any contact 3-manifold supported by a spinal open book decomposition with planar pages, there is a universal bound on the Euler characteristic and signature of its minimal symplectic fillings. The proof is an application of the spine removal surgery operation recently introduced in joint work of the authors with Van Horn-Morris.
