We prove a result which establishes restrictions on the pseudoholomorphic curves which can exist in a stable Hamiltonian manifold in the presence of certain \mathbb{R}-invariant foliations of the symplectization by holomorphic hypersurfaces. This result has applications in the first author's work on algebraic torsion in higher dimensional contact manifolds.
