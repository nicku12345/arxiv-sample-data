Perverse schober defined by Kapranov--Schechtman is a categorification of the notion of perverse sheaf. In their definition, a key ingredient is certain purity property of perverse sheaves. In this short note, we attempt to describe a real analogue of the above story, as categorification of Legendrian points/knots. The notion turns out to include various notions such as semi-orthogonal decomposition, mutation braiding, spherical functor, N-spherical functor, and irregular perverse schober.
