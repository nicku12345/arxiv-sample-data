Arboreal singularities are an important class of Lagrangian singularities. They are conical, meaning that they can be understood by studying their links, which are singular Legendrian spaces in S^{2n-1}_{\text{std}}. Loose Legendrians are a class of Legendrian spaces which satisfy an h--principle, meaning that their geometric classification is in bijective correspondence with their topological types. For the particular case of the linear arboreal singularities, we show that constructable sheaves suffice to detect whether any closed set of an arboreal link is loose.
