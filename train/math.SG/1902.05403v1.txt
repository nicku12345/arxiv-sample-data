This work is concerned with Bielawski's hyperk\"ahler slices in the cotangent bundles of homogeneous affine varieties. One can associate such a slice to the data of a complex semisimple Lie group G, a reductive subgroup H\subseteq G, and a Slodowy slice S\subseteq\mathfrak{g}:=\mathrm{Lie}(G), defining it to be the hyperk\"ahler quotient of T^*(G/H)\times (G\times S) by a maximal compact subgroup of G. This hyperk\"ahler slice is empty in some of the most elementary cases (e.g. when S is regular and (G,H)=(\operatorname{SL}_{n+1},\operatorname{GL}_{n}), n\geq 3), prompting us to seek necessary and sufficient conditions for non-emptiness.   We give a spherical-geometric characterization of the non-empty hyperk\"ahler slices that arise when S=S_{\text{reg}} is a regular Slodowy slice, proving that non-emptiness is equivalent to the so-called \mathfrak{a}-regularity of (G,H). This \mathfrak{a}-regularity condition is formulated in several equivalent ways, one being a concrete condition on the rank and complexity of G/H. We also provide a classification of the \mathfrak{a}-regular pairs (G,H) in which H is a reductive spherical subgroup. Our arguments make essential use of Knop's results on moment map images and Losev's algorithm for computing Cartan spaces.
