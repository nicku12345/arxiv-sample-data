Consider the Hamiltonian action of a torus on a transversely symplectic foliation that is also Riemannian. When the transverse hard Lefschetz property is satisfied, we establish a foliated version of the Kirwan injectivity theorem, and use it to study Hamiltonian torus actions on transversely K\"ahler foliations. Among other things, we prove a foliated version of the Carrell-Liberman theorem. As an immediate consequence, this confirms a conjecture raised by Battaglia and Zaffran on the basic Hodge numbers of symplectic toric quasifolds. As an aside, we also present a symplectic approach to the calculation of basic Betti numbers of symplectic toric quasifolds.
