We consider symplectic cohomology twisted by sphere bundles, which can be viewed as an analogue of local systems. Using the associated Gysin exact sequence, we prove the uniqueness of part of the ring structure on cohomology of fillings for those asymptotically dynamically convex manifolds with vanishing property considered in [27,29]. In particular, for simply connected 4n+1 dimensional flexible fillable contact Y, we show that real cohomology H^*(W) is unique as a ring for any Liouville filling W of Y as long as c_1(W)=0. Uniqueness of real homotopy type of Liouville fillings is also obtained for a class of flexibly fillable contact manifolds.
