The purpose of this paper is to bring together various loose ends in the theory of integrable systems. For a semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak g, we obtain several results on completeness of homogeneous Poisson-commutative subalgebras of {\mathcal S}(\mathfrak g) on coadjoint orbits. This concerns, in particular, Mishchenko-Fomenko and Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebras.
