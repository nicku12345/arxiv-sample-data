Given a two-variable invertible polynomial, we show that its category of maximally-graded matrix factorisations is quasi-equivalent to the Fukaya-Seidel category of its Berglund-H\"ubsch transpose. This was previously shown for Brieskorn-Pham and D-type singularities by Futaki-Ueda. The proof involves explicit construction of a tilting object on the B-side, and comparison with a specific basis of Lefschetz thimbles on the A-side.
