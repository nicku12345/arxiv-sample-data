We introduce and study the notion of contact dual pair adopting a line bundle approach to contact and Jacobi geometry. A contact dual pair is a pair of Jacobi morphisms defined on the same contact manifold and satisfying a certain orthogonality condition. Contact groupoids and contact reduction are the main sources of examples. Among other properties, we prove the Characteristic Leaf Correspondence Theorem for contact dual pairs which parallels the analogous result of Weinstein for symplectic dual pairs.
