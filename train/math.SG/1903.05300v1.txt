In this paper we consider the oscillatory integrals on Lefschetz thimbles in the Landau-Ginzburg model as the mirror of a toric Fano manifold. We show these thimbles represent the same relative homology classes as the characteristic cycles of the corresponding constructible sheaves under the equivalence of \cite{GPS18-2}. Then the oscillatory integrals on such thimbles are the same as the integrals on the characteristic cycles and relate to genus 0 Gromov-Witten descendant potential for X, and this leads to a proof of Gamma II conjecture for toric Fano manifolds.
