In symplectic geometry, symplectic invariants are useful tools in studying symplectic phenomena. Hofer-Zehnder capacity and displacement energy are important symplectic invariants. Usher proved the so-called sharp energy-capacity inequality between Hofer-Zehnder capacity and the displacement energy for closed symplectic manifolds. In this paper, we extend the sharp energy-capacity inequality to convex symplectic manifolds.
