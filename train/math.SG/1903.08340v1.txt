Given two 2n--dimensional symplectic ellipsoids whose symplectic sizes satisfy certain inequalities, we show that a certain map from the n--torus to the space of symplectic embeddings from one ellipsoid to the other induces an injective map on singular homology with mod 2 coefficients. The proof uses parametrized moduli spaces of J--holomorphic cylinders in completed symplectic cobordisms.
