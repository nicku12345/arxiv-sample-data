We generalize some properties of surface automorphisms of pseudo-Anosov type. First, we generalize the Penner construction of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism and show that a symplectic automorphism which is constructed by our generalized Penner construction has an invariant Lagrangian branched submanifold and an invariant Lagrangian lamination, which are higher-dimensional generalizations of a train track and a geodesic lamination in the surface case. Moreover, if a pair consisting of a symplectic automorphism \psi and a Lagrangian branched surface B_{\psi} satisfies some assumptions, we prove that there is an invariant Lagrangian lamination \mathcal{L} which is a higher-dimensional generalization of a geodesic lamination.
