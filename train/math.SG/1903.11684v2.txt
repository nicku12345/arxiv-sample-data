Using the classification of 6-dimensional manifolds by Wall, Jupp and \v{Z}ubr, we observe that the diffeomorphism type of simply-connected, compact 6-dimensional integer GKM T^2-manifolds is encoded in their GKM graph. As an application, we show that the 6-dimensional manifolds on which Tolman and Woodward constructed Hamiltonian, non-K\"ahler T^2-actions with finite fixed point set are both diffeomorphic to Eschenburg's twisted flag manifold SU(3)//T^2. In particular, they admit a noninvariant K\"ahler structure.
