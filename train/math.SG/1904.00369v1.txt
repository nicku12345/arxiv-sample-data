We describe Lefschetz-Bott fibrations on complex line bundles over symplectic manifolds explicitly. As an application, we construct more than one strong symplectic filling of the link of the A_{k}-type singularity. In the appendix, we show that the total space of a Lefschetz-Bott fibration over the unit disk serves as a strong symplectic filling of a contact manifold compatible with an open book induced by the fibration.
