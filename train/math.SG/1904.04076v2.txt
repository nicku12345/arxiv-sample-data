Let \pi\colon (M,\omega)\to B be a (non-singular) Lagrangian torus fibration on a compact, complete base B with prequantum line bundle (L,\nabla^L)\to (M,\omega). For a positive integer N and a compatible almost complex structure J on (M,\omega) invariant along the fiber of \pi, let D be the associated Spin{}^c Dirac operator with coefficients in L^{\otimes N}. Then, we give an orthogonal family \{ {\tilde \vartheta}_b\}_{b\in B_{BS}} of sections of L^{\otimes N} indexed by the Bohr-Sommerfeld points B_{BS}, and show that each {\tilde \vartheta}_b converges to a delta-function section supported on the corresponding Bohr-Sommerfeld fiber \pi^{-1}(b) and the L^2-norm of D{\tilde \vartheta}_b converges to 0 by the adiabatic(-type) limit. Moreover, if J is integrable, we also give an orthogonal basis \{ \vartheta_b\}_{b\in B_{BS}} of the space of holomorphic sections of L^{\otimes N} indexed by B_{BS}, and show that each \vartheta_b converges to a delta-function section supported on the corresponding Bohr-Sommerfeld fiber \pi^{-1}(b) by the adiabatic(-type) limit. We also explain the relation of \vartheta_b with Jacobi's theta functions when (M,\omega) is T^{2n}.
