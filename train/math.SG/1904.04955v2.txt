In this paper, we investigate the minimal symplectic fillings of small Seifert 3-manifolds with a canonical contact structure. As a result, we classify all minimal symplectic fillings of small Seifert 3-manifolds satisfying certain conditions. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that every such a minimal symplectic filling is obtained by a sequence of rational blowdowns from the minimal resolution of the corresponding weighted homogeneous complex surface singularity.
