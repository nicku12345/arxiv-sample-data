We produce for each tropical hypersurface V(\phi)\subset Q=\mathbb{R}^n a Lagrangian L(\phi)\subset (\mathbb{C}^*)^n whose moment map projection is a tropical amoeba of V(\phi). When these Lagrangians are admissible in the Fukaya-Seidel category, we show that they are unobstructed objects of the Fukaya category, and mirror to sheaves supported on complex hypersurfaces in a toric mirror.
