We give an explicit computation of the ring structure in wrapped Floer homology of a class of real Lagrangians in A_k-type Milnor fibers. In the A_k-type plumbing description, those Lagrangians correspond to the cotangent fibers or the diagonal Lagrangians. The main ingredient of the computation is to apply a version of the Seidel representation. For a technical reason, we first carry out computations in v-shaped wrapped Floer homology, and this in turn gives the desired ring structure via the Viterbo transfer map.
