Let (M,\omega_M) be a six dimensional closed monotone symplectic manifold admitting an effective semifree Hamiltonian S^1-action. We show that if the maximal and the minimal fixed component are both two dimensional, then (M,\omega_M) is S^1-equivariantly symplectomorphic to some K\"{a}hler Fano manifold (X, \omega_X, J) equipped with a certain holomorphic Hamiltonian S^1-action. We also give a complete list of all such Fano manifolds together with an explicit description of the corresponding S^1-actions.
