In this paper, we study various asymptotic behavior of the infinite family of monotone Lagrangian tori T_{a,b,c} in \mathbb{CP}^2 associated to Markov triples (a,b,c) described in \cite{Vi14}. We first prove that the Gromov capacity of the complement \mathbb{CP}^2 \setminus T_{a,b,c} is greater than or equal to \frac13 of the area of the complex line for all Markov triple (a,b,c). We then prove that there is a representative of the family \{T_{a,b,c}\} whose loci completely miss a metric ball of nonzero size and in particular the loci of the union of the family is not dense in \mathbb{CP}^2.
