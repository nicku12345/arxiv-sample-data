The Legendrian product of two Legendrian knots, as defined by Lambert-Cole, is a Legendrian torus. We show that this Legendrian torus is a twist spun whenever one of the Legendrian knot components is sufficiently large. We then study examples of Legendrian products which are not Legendrian isotopic to twist spuns. In order to do this, we prove a few structural results on the bilinearised Legendrian contact homology and augmentation variety of a twist spun. In addition, we show that the threefold Bohr-Sommerfeld covers of the Clifford torus and Chekanov torus are not twist spuns.
