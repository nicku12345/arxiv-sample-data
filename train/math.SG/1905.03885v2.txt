We provide an enumerative meaning of the mirror maps for toric Calabi-Yau orbifolds in terms of relative Gromov-Witten invariants of the toric compactifications. As a consequence, we obtain an equality between relative Gromov-Witten invariants and open Gromov-Witten invariants. Therefore, the instanton corrected mirrors for toric Calabi-Yau orbifolds can be constructed using relative Gromov-Witten invariants.
