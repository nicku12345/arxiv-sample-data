In this paper, we complete the classification of six-dimensional closed monotone symplectic manifolds admitting semifree Hamiltonian S^1-actions. We also show that every such manifold is S^1-equivariantly symplectomorphic to some K\"{a}ahler Fano manifold with a certain holomorphic Hamiltonian circle action.
