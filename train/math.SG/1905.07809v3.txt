The purpose of this paper is to study the relation between the C^0-topology and the topology induced by the spectral norm on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold. Following the approach of Buhovsky-Humili\`ere-Seyfaddini, we prove the C^0-continuity of the spectral norm for complex projective spaces and negative monotone symplectic manifolds. The case of complex projective spaces provides an alternative approach to the C^0-continuity of the spectral norm proven by Shelukhin. We also prove a partial C^0-continuity of the spectral norm for rational symplectic manifolds. Some applications such as the Arnold conjecture in the context of C^0-symplectic topology are also discussed.
