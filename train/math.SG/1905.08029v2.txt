Let D be a 2-dimensional closed unit disk and \rm{Symp}(D,0)_{\rm{rel}} the group of symplectomorphisms preserving the origin and the boundary \partial D pointwise. We consider the \mathbb{R}-valued flux homomorphism on \rm{Symp}(D,0)_{\rm{rel}} and define the central \mathbb{R}-extension called the \mathbb{R}-valued flux extension. We determine the Euler class of this extension and investigate the relation between the extension, the group 2-cocycle defined by Ismagilov, Losik, and Michor, and the Calabi invariant of D.
