We study the geography of bilinearized Legendrian contact homology for closed, connected Legendrian submanifolds with vanishing Maslov class in 1-jet spaces. We show that this invariant detects whether the two augmentations used to define it are DGA homotopic or not. We describe a collection of graded vector spaces containing all possible values for bilinearized Legendrian contact homology and then show that all these vector spaces can be realized.
