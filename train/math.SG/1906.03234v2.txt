Let M be a manifold with a closed, integral (k+1)-form \omega, and let G be a Fr\'echet-Lie group acting on (M,\omega). As a generalization of the Kostant-Souriau extension for symplectic manifolds, we consider a canonical class of central extensions of \mathfrak{g} by \mathbb{R}, indexed by H^{k-1}(M,\mathbb{R})^*. We show that the image of H_{k-1}(M,\mathbb{Z}) in H^{k-1}(M,\mathbb{R})^* corresponds to a lattice of Lie algebra extensions that integrate to smooth central extensions of G by the circle group \mathbb{T}. The idea is to represent a class in H_{k-1}(M,\mathbb{Z}) by a weighted submanifold (S,\beta), where \beta is a closed, integral form on S. We use transgression of differential characters from S and  M  to the mapping space  C^\infty(S, M) , and apply the Kostant-Souriau construction on  C^\infty(S, M) .
