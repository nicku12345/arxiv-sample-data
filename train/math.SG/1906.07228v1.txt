Let X be a Weinstein manifold with ideal contact boundary Y. If \Lambda\subset Y is a link of Legendrian spheres in Y then by attaching Weinstein handles to X along \Lambda we get a Weinstein cobordism X_{\Lambda} with a collection of Lagrangian co-core disks C corresponding to \Lambda. In \cite{BEE, EL} it was shown that the wrapped Floer cohomology CW^{\ast}(C) of C in the Weinstein manifold X'_{\Lambda}=X\cup X_{\Lambda}is naturally isomorphic to the Legendrian differential graded algebra CE^{\ast}(\Lambda) of \Lambda in Y. The argument uses properties of moduli spaces of holomorphic curves, the proofs of which were only sketched. The purpose of this paper is to provide proofs of these properties.
