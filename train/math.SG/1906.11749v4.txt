We develop a G-equivariant Lagrangian Floer theory and obtain a curved A_\infty algebra, and in particular a G-equivariant disc potential. We construct a Morse model, which counts pearly trees in the Borel construction L_G. When applied to a smooth moment map fiber of a semi-Fano toric manifold, our construction recovers the T-equivariant toric Landau-Ginzburg mirror of Givental. We also study the \bS^1-equivariant Floer theory of a typical singular SYZ fiber (i.e. a pinched torus) and compute its \bS^1-equivariant disc potential via the gluing technique developed in \cite{CHL18,HKL}.
