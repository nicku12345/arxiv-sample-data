We classify complex surfaces (M,\,J) admitting Engel structures \mathcal{D} which are complex line bundles. Namely we prove that this happens if and only if (M,\,J) has trivial Chern classes. We construct examples of such Engel structures by adapting a construction due to Geiges. We also study associated Engel defining forms and define a unique splitting of TM associated with \mathcal{D} J-Engel.
