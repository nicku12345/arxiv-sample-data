We introduce the moduli space of quasi-parabolic SL(2,\mathbb{C})-Higgs bundles over a compact Riemann surface \Sigma and consider a natural involution, studying its fixed point locus when \Sigma is \mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^1 and establishing an identification with a moduli space of null polygons in Minkowski 3-space.
