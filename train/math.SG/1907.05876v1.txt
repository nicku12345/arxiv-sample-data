Novikov's theorem is a rigidity result on the class of taut foliations on three-manifolds. For higher dimensional manifolds, the existence of a strong symplectic form has been proposed as an analogue for tautness in order to achieve similar rigidity. This leads to the natural question of whether strong symplectic foliations satisfy an analogue of Novikov's theorem. In this paper, we construct a five-dimensional manifold with a strong symplectic foliation that does not satisfy the expected analogue of Novikov's theorem.
