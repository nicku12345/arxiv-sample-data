We lay the foundations of convex hypersurface theory (CHT) in contact topology, extending the work of Giroux in dimension three. Specifically, we prove that any closed hypersurface in a contact manifold can be C^0-approximated by a convex one. We also prove that a C^0-generic family of mutually disjoint closed hypersurfaces parametrized by t \in [0,1] is convex except at finitely many times t_1, \dots, t_N, and that crossing each t_i corresponds to a bypass attachment. As applications of CHT, we prove the existence of compatible (relative) open book decompositions for contact manifolds and an existence h-principle for codimension 2 contact submanifolds.
