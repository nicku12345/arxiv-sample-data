Given a spin^c rational homology sphere (Y,\mathfrak{s}) with \mathfrak{s} self-conjugate and for which the reduced monopole Floer homology \mathit{HM}_{\bullet}(Y,\mathfrak{s}) has rank one, we provide obstructions to the intersection forms of its Stein fillings which are not negative definite. The proof of this result (and of its natural generalizations we discuss) uses \mathrm{Pin}(2)-monopole Floer homology.
