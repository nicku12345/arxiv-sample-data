We study coisotropic submanifolds of b-symplectic manifolds. We prove that b-coisotropic submanifolds (those transverse to the degeneracy locus) determine the b-symplectic structure in a neighborhood, and provide a normal form theorem. This extends Gotay's theorem in symplectic geometry. Further, we introduce strong b-coisotropic submanifolds and show that their coisotropic quotient, which locally is always smooth, inherits a reduced b-symplectic structure.
