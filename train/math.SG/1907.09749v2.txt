For any nonempty, compact and fiberwise convex set K in T^*\mathbb{R}^n, we prove an isomorphism between symplectic homology of K and a certain relative homology of loop spaces of \mathbb{R}^n. We also prove a formula which computes symplectic homology capacity (which is a symplectic capacity defined from symplectic homology) of K using homology of loop spaces. As applications, we prove (i) symplectic homology capacity of any convex body is equal to its Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity, (ii) a certain subadditivity property of the Hofer-Zehnder capacity, which is a generalization of a result previously proved by Haim-Kislev.
