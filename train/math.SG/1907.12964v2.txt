Let G be a real reductive Lie group, L a compact subgroup, and \pi an irreducible admissible representation of G. In this article we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the finiteness of the multiplicities of L-types occurring in \pi based on symplectic techniques. This leads us to a simple proof of the criterion for discrete decomposability of the restriction of unitary representations with respect to noncompact subgroups (the author, Ann. Math. 1998), and also provides a proof of a reverse statement which was announced in [Proc.ICM 2002, Thm.D]. A number of examples are presented in connection with Kostant's convexity theorem and also with non-Riemannian locally symmetric spaces.
