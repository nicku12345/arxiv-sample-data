Given a standard complex semisimple Poisson Lie group (G, \pi_{st}), generalised double Bruhat cells G^{u, v} and generalised Bruhat cells O^u equipped with naturally defined holomorphic Poisson structures, where u, v are finite sequences of Weyl group elements, were defined and studied by Jiang Hua Lu and the author. We prove in this paper that G^{u,u} is naturally a Poisson groupoid over O^u, extending a result from the aforementioned authors about double Bruhat cells in (G, \pi_{st}). Our result on G^{u,u} is obtained as an application of a construction interesting in its own right, of a local Poisson groupoid over a mixed product Poisson structure associated to the action of a pair of Lie bialgebras. This construction involves using a local Lagrangian bisection in a double symplectic groupoid closely related to the global R-matrix studied by Weinstein and Xu, to twist a direct product of Poisson groupoids.
