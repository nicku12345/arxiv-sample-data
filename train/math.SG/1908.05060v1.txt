A Riemann-Poisson Lie group is a Lie group endowed with a left invariant Riemannian metric and a left invariant Poisson tensor which are compatible in the sense introduced in C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris s\'er. {\bf I 333} (2001) 763-768. We study these Lie groups and we give a characterization of their Lie algebras. We give also a way of building these Lie algebras and we give the list of such Lie algebras up to dimension 5.
