Given a contact structure on a manifold V together with a supporting open book decomposition, Bourgeois gave an explicit construction of a contact structure on V \times \mathbb{T}^2.We prove that all such structures are universally tight in dimension 5, independent on whether the original contact manifold is tight or overtwisted. In the planar case we give obstructions to the existence of strong symplectic fillings and we also obtain a broad class of new examples of weakly but not strongly fillable contact 5--manifolds.   The techniques developed in the 5--dimensional case also allow us to obtain two further results in arbitrary dimensions. Firstly, that the unit cotangent bundle of the n-torus has a unique symplectically aspherical strong filling up to diffeomorphism; secondly, that the Bourgeois contact manifold associated to the open book with monodromy given by a single Dehn--Seidel twist on the unit cotangent bundle of the n-sphere admits no strong filling. The latter answers a question of Lisi--Marinkovi\'c--Niederkr\"uger and provides the first examples of weakly but not strongly fillable contact structures in all dimensions.
