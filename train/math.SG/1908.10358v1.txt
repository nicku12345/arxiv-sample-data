We compare two associative algebras which encode the "quantum topology" of Legendrian curves in contact threefolds of product type S\times\mathbb R. The first is the skein algebra of graded Legendrian links and the second is the Hall algebra of the Fukaya category of S. We construct a natural homomorphism from the former to the latter, which we show is an isomorphism if S is a disk with marked points and injective if S is the annulus.
