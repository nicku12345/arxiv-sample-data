We prove the existence of a smoothing for a toroidal crossing space under mild assumptions. By linking log structures with infinitesimal deformations, the result receives a very compact form for normal crossing spaces. The main approach is to study log structures that are incoherent on a subspace of codimension two and prove a Hodge to de Rham degeneration theorem for such log spaces. We show that new developments of Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theory can be applied to obtain smoothings. The theory relates to recent work in mirror symmetry and the construction of Frobenius manifold structures. It has potential applications to the classification of Fano fourfolds.
