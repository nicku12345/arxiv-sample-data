We generalize the mixed tori which appear in the second author's JSJ-type decomposition theorem for symplectic fillings of contact manifolds. Mixed tori are convex surfaces in contact manifolds which may be used to decompose symplectic fillings. We call our more general surfaces splitting surfaces, and show that the decomposition of symplectic fillings continues to hold. Specifically, given a strong or exact symplectic filling of a contact manifold which admits a splitting surface, we produce a new symplectic manifold which strongly or exactly fills its boundary, and which is related to the original filling by Liouville surgery.
