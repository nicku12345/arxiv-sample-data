We introduce the category of {\it locally k-standard T-manifolds} which includes well-known classes of manifolds such as toric and quasitoric manifolds, good contact toric manifolds and moment-angle manifolds. They are smooth manifolds with well-behaved actions of tori. We study their topological properties, such as fundamental groups and equivariant cohomology algebras. Then, we discuss when the torus equivariant cohomology algebra distinguishes them up to weakly equivariant homeomorphism.
