We classify weakly exact, rational Lagrangian tori in T^* \mathbb{T}^2- 0_{\mathbb{T}^2} up to Hamiltonian isotopy. This result is related to the classification theory of closed 1-forms on \mathbb{T}^n and also has applications to symplectic topology. As a first corollary, we strengthen a result due independently to Eliashberg-Polterovich and to Giroux describing Lagrangian tori in T^* \mathbb{T}^2-0_{\mathbb{T}^2} which are homologous to the zero section. As a second corollary, we exhibit pairs of disjoint totally real tori K_1, K_2 \subset T^*\mathbb{T}^2, each of which is isotopic through totally real tori to the zero section, but such that the union K_1 \cup K_2 is not even smoothly isotopic to a Lagrangian.   In the second part of the paper, we study linking of Lagrangian tori in (\mathbb{R}^4, \omega) and in rational symplectic 4-manifolds. We prove that the linking properties of such tori are determined by purely algebro-topological data, which can often be deduced from enumerative disk counts in the monotone case. We also use this result to describe certain Lagrangian embedding obstructions.
