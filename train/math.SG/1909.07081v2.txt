In this article we study the Arnold conjecture in settings where objects under consideration are no longer smooth but only continuous. The example of a Hamiltonian homeomorphism, on any closed symplectic manifold of dimension greater than 2, having only one fixed point shows that the conjecture does not admit a direct generalization to continuous settings. However, it appears that the following Arnold-type principle continues to hold in continuous settings: Suppose that X is a non-smooth object for which one can define spectral invariants. If the number of spectral invariants associated to X is smaller than the number predicted by the (homological) Arnold conjecture, then the set of fixed/intersection points of X is homologically non-trivial, hence it is infinite.   We recently proved that the above principle holds for Hamiltonian homeomorphisms of closed and aspherical symplectic manifolds. In this article, we verify this principle in two new settings: C^0 Lagrangians in cotangent bundles and Hausdorff limits of Legendrians in 1-jet bundles which are isotopic to the zero section.   An unexpected consequence of the result on Legendrians is that the classical Arnold conjecture does hold for Hausdorff limits of Legendrians in 1-jet bundles.
