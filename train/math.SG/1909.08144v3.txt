We show that the leaves of an LA-groupoid which pass through the unit manifold are, modulo a connectedness issue, Lie groupoids. We illustrate this phenomenon by considering the cotangent Lie algebroids of Poisson groupoids thus obtaining an interesting class of symplectic groupoids coming from their symplectic foliations. In particular, we show that for a (strict) Lie 2-group the coadjoint orbits of the units in the dual of its Lie 2-algebra are symplectic groupoids, meaning that the classical Kostant-Kirillov-Souriau symplectic forms on these special coadjoint orbits are multiplicative.
