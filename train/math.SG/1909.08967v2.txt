We prove representation formulas for the coisotropic Hofer-Zehnder capacities of bounded convex domains with special coisotropic submanifolds and the leaf relation (introduced by Lisi and Rieser recently), study their estimates and relations with the Hofer-Zehnder capacity, give some interesting corollaries, and also obtain corresponding versions of a Brunn-Minkowski type inequality by Artstein-Avidan and Ostrover and a theorem by Evgeni Neduv.
