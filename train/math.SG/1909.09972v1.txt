We prove that the count of Maslov index 2 J-holomorphic discs passing through a generic point of a real Lagrangian submanifold in a closed spherically monotone symplectic manifold must be even. As a corollary, we exhibit a genuine real symplectic phenomenon in terms of involutions, namely that the Chekanov torus \mathbb{T}_{\text{Chek}} in S^2\times S^2, which is a monotone Lagrangian torus not Hamiltonian isotopic to the Clifford torus \mathbb{T}_{\text{Clif}}, can be seen as the fixed point set of a smooth involution, but not of an antisymplectic involution.
