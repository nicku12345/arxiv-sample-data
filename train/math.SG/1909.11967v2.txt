In the context of symplectic dynamics, pseudo-rotations are Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms with finite and minimal possible number of periodic orbits. These maps are of interest in both dynamics and symplectic topology. We show that a closed, monotone symplectic manifold, which admits a non-degenerate pseudo-rotation, must have a deformed quantum Steenrod square of the top degree element, and hence non-trivial holomorphic spheres. This result (partially) generalizes a recent work by Shelukhin and complements the results by the authors on non-vanishing Gromov-Witten invariants of manifolds admitting pseudo-rotations.
