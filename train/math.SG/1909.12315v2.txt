In this note we prove that if a closed monotone symplectic manifold admits a Hamiltonian pseudo-rotation, which may be degenerate, then the quantum Steenrod square of the cohomology class Poincar\'{e} dual to the point must be deformed. This result gives restrictions on the existence of pseudo-rotations, implying a form of uniruledness by pseudo-holomorphic spheres, and generalizes a recent result of the author. The new component in the proof consists in an elementary calculation with capped periodic orbits.
