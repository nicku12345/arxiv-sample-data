In this paper we study some aspects of integrable magnetic systems on the two-torus. On the one hand, we construct the first non-trivial examples with the property that all magnetic geodesics with unit speed are closed. On the other hand, we show that those integrable magnetic systems admitting a global surface of section satisfy a sharp systolic inequality.
