Let X be an n-dimensional manifold and V_1,\ldots,V_n\subset C^\infty(X,\mathbb R) finite-dimensional vector spaces. For systems of equations \{f_i = a_i\colon\: f_i\in V_i,\:a_i \in\mathbb R,\:i=1,\ldots,n\} we discover a relationship between the average number of their solutions and mixed volumes of convex bodies. To do this, we choose Banach metrics in the spaces V_i. Using these metrics, we construct 1) the measure in the space of systems, and 2) Banach convex bodies in X, i.e., collections of centrally symmetric convex bodies in the fibers of the cotangent bundle of X. It turns out that the average number of solutions is equal to the mixed symplectic volume of Banach convex bodies. Earlier this result was obtained for Euclidean metrics in spaces V_i. In Euclidean case, the Banach convex bodies are the collections of ellipsoids.
