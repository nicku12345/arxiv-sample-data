For r \geq 1 and \mathbf{n} \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}^r\setminus\{\mathbf{0}\}, we construct a proper complex variety \overline{2M}_{\mathbf{n}}. \overline{2M}_{\mathbf{n}} is locally toric, and it is equipped with a forgetful map \overline{2M}_{\mathbf{n}} \to \overline M_{0,r+1}. This space is a compactification of 2M_{\mathbf{n}}, the configuration space of marked vertical lines in \mathbb{C}^2 up to translations and dilations. In the appendices, we give several examples and show how the stratification of \overline{2M}_{\mathbf{n}} can be used to recursively compute its virtual Poincar\'{e} polynomial.
