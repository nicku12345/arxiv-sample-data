We construct distinguished elements in the embedded contact homology (and monopole Floer homology) of a 3-torus, associated with Lagrangian tori in symplectic 4-manifolds and their isotopy classes. They turn out not to be new invariants, instead they repackage the Gromov (and Seiberg-Witten) invariants of various torus surgeries. We then recover a result of Morgan-Mrowka-Szab\'o on product formulas for the Seiberg-Witten invariants along 3-tori.
