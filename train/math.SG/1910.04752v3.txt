We derive a complete asymptotic expansion of generalized Witten integrals for Hamiltonian circle actions on arbitrary symplectic manifolds, characterizing the coefficients in the expansion as integrals over the symplectic strata of the corresponding Marsden-Weinstein reduced space and distributions on the Lie algebra. The obtained coefficients involve singular contributions of the lower-dimensional strata related to numerical invariants of the fixed-point set.
