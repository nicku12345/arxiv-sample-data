We study the integrability of Poisson and Dirac structures that arise from quotient constructions. From our results we deduce several classical results as well as new applications. We also give explicit constructions of Lie groupoids integrating two interesting families of geometric structures: (i) a special class of Poisson homogeneous spaces of symplectic groupoids integrating Poisson groups and (ii) Dirac homogeneous spaces.
