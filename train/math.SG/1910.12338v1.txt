Based on computations of Pandharipande, Zinger proved that the Gopakumar-Vafa BPS invariants \mathrm{BPS}_{A,g}(X,\omega) for primitive Calabi-Yau classes and arbitrary Fano classes A on a symplectic 6-manifold (X,\omega) agree with the signed count n_{A,g}(X,\omega) of embedded J-holomorphic curves representing A and of genus g for a generic almost complex structure J compatible with \omega. Zinger's proof of the invariance of n_{A,g}(X,\omega) is indirect, as it relies on Gromov--Witten theory. In this article we give a direct proof of the invariance of n_{A,g}(X,\omega). Furthermore, we prove that n_{A,g}(X,\omega) = 0 for g \gg 1, thus proving the Gopakumar-Vafa finiteness conjecture for primitive Calabi-Yau classes and arbitrary Fano classes.
