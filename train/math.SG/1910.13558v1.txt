With the goal to study and better understand algebraic Anosov actions of \mathbb R^k, we develop a higher codimensional analogue of the contact distribution on odd dimensional manifolds, call such structure a generalized k-contact structure. We show that there exist an \mathbb R^k-action associated with this structure, afterwards, we relate this structure with the Weyl chamber actions and a few more general algebraic Anosov actions, proving that such actions admits a compatible generalized k-contact structure.
