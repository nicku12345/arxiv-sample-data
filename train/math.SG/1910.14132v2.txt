We first present a general construction of Liouville domains as partial mapping tori. Then we study two examples where the (partial) monodromies exhibit certain hyperbolic behavior in the sense of Dynamical Systems. The first example is based on Smale's attractor, a.k.a., solenoid; and the second example is based on certain hyperbolic toral automorphisms.
