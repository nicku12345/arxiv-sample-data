For subsets in the standard symplectic space (\mathbb{R}^{2n},\omega_0) whose closures are intersecting with coisotropic subspace \mathbb{R}^{n,k} we construct relative versions of their Ekeland-Hofer capacities with respect to \mathbb{R}^{n,k}, establish representation formulas for such capacities of bounded convex domains intersecting with \mathbb{R}^{n,k}, and also prove a product formula and a fact that the value of this capacity on a hypersurface \mathcal{S} of restricted contact type containing the origin is equal to the action of a generalized leafwise chord on \mathcal{S}.
