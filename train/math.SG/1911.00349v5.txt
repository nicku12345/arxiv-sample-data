We establish the continuous functoriality of wrapped Fukaya categories with respect to Liouville automorphisms, yielding a way to probe the homotopy type of the automorphism group of a Liouville sector. These methods prove Liouville and monotone cases of a conjecture of Teleman from the 2014 ICM. In the case of a cotangent bundle, we show that the Abouzaid equivalence between the wrapped category and the infinity-category of local systems intertwines our action with the action of diffeomorphisms of the zero section. In particular, our methods yield a typically non-trivial map from the rational homotopy groups of Liouville automorphisms to the rational string topology algebra of the zero section.
