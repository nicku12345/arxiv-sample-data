In this paper we motivate some new directions of research regarding the lattice width of convex bodies. We show that convex bodies of sufficiently large width contain a unimodular copy of a standard simplex. This implies that every lattice polytope contains a minimal generating set of the affine lattice spanned by its lattice points such that the number of generators is bounded by a constant which only depends on the dimension. We also discuss relations to recent results on spanning lattice polytopes and how our results could be viewed as the beginning of the study of generalized flatness constants. Regarding symplectic geometry, we point out how the lattice width of a Delzant polytope is related to upper and lower bounds on the Gromov width of its associated symplectic toric manifold. Throughout, we include several open questions.
