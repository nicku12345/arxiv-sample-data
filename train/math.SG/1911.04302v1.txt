Using the bulk-deformation of Floer cohomology by Schubert cycles and non-Archimedean analysis of Fukaya--Oh--Ohta--Ono's bulk-deformed potential function, we prove that every complete flag manifold \mathrm{Fl}(n) (n \geq 3) with a monotone Kirillov--Kostant--Souriau symplectic form carries a continuum of non-displaceable Lagrangian tori which degenerates to a non-torus fiber in the Hausdorff limit. In particular, the Lagrangian S^3-fiber in \mathrm{Fl}(3) is non-displaceable, answering the question of which was raised by Nohara--Ueda who computed its Floer cohomology to be vanishing.
