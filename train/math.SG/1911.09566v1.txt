Motivated by Pazit Haim-Kislev's combinatorial formula for the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacities of convex polytopes, we give corresponding formulas for \Psi-Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder and coisotropic Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacities of convex polytopes introduced by the second named author and others recently. Contrary to Pazit Haim-Kislev's subadditivity result for the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacities of convex domains, we show that the coisotropic Hofer-Zehnder capacities satisfy the subadditivity for suitable hyperplane cuts of two-dimensional convex domains in the reverse direction.
