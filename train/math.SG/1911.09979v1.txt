Biran and Cornea showed that monotone Lagrangian cobordisms give an equivalence of objects in the Fukaya category. We take a first look at extending this theory to the non-monotone case and show that Lagrangian surfaces related by mutation along an antisurgery disk are equivalent after incorporation of an appropriate bounding cochain. An interpretation of these corrections as a wall-crossing formula is given for the example of \mathbb C^2\setminus\{z_1z_2=1\}. We additionally provide some constructions for filtered A_\infty algebras, specifically the construction of mapping cocylinders.
