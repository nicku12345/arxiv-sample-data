For (\mathbb{C} P^2 \# 5{\overline {\mathbb{C} P^2}},\omega), let N_{\omega} be the number of (-2)-symplectic spherical homology classes.We completely determine the Torelli symplectic mapping class group (Torelli SMCG): the Torelli SMCG is trivial if N_{\omega}>8; it is \pi_0(Diff^+(S^2,5)) if N_{\omega}=0 (by Paul Seidel and Jonathan Evans); it is \pi_0(Diff^+(S^2,4)) in the remaining case. Further, we completely determine the rank of \pi_1(Symp(\mathbb{C} P^2 \# 5{\overline {\mathbb{C} P^2}}, \omega) for any given symplectic form. Our results can be uniformly presented regarding Dynkin diagrams of type \mathbb{A} and type \mathbb{D} Lie algebras. We also provide a solution to the smooth isotopy problem of rational 4-manifolds.
