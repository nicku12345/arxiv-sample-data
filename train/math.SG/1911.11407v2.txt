Let P be a Delzant polytope in \mathbb{R}^k with n+k facets. We associate a closed Lagrangian submanifold L of \mathbb{C}^n to each Delzant polytope. We prove that L is monotone if and only if and only if the polytope P is Fano. We pose the "Lagrangian version of Delzant Theorem". Then for even p and n we construct \frac{p}{2} monotone Lagrangian embeddings of S^{p-1} \times S^{n-p-1} \times T^2 into \mathbb{C}^n, no two of which are related by Hamiltonian isotopies. Some of these embeddings are smoothly isotopic and have equal minimal Maslov numbers, but they are not Hamiltonian isotopic. Also, we construct infinitely many non-monotone Lagrangian embeddings of S^{2p-1} \times S^{2p-1} \times T^2 into \mathbb{C}^{4p}, no two of which are related by Hamiltonian isotopies.
