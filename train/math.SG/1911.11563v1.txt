In this article, associated to a (bordered) Legendrian graph, we study and show the equivalence between two Legendrian isotopy invariants: augmentation number via point-counting over a finite field, for the augmentation variety of the associated Chekanov-Eliashberg differential graded algebra, and ruling polynomial via combinatorics of the decompositions of the associated front projection.
