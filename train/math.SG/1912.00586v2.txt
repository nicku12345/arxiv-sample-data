The argument shift method is a well-known method for generating commutative families of functions in Poisson algebras from central elements and a vector field, verifying a special condition with respect to the Poisson bracket. In this notice we give an analogous construction, which gives one a way to create commutative subalgebras of a deformed algebra from its center (which is as it is well known describable in the terms of the center of the Poisson algebra) and an L_\infty-differentiation of the algebra of Hochschild cochains, verifying some additional conditions with respect to the Poisson structure.
