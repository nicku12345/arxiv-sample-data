Given an exact symplectic cobordism (X, \lambda) between contact 3-manifolds (Y_+, \lambda_+) and (Y_-, \lambda_-) with no elliptic Reeb orbits up to a certain action, we define a chain map from the embedded contact homology (ECH) chain complex of (Y_+, \lambda_+) to that of (Y_-, \lambda_-), both taken with coefficients in \mathbb Z / 2 \mathbb Z. The map is defined by counting punctured holomorphic curves with ECH index 0 in the completion of the cobordism and new objects that we call ECH buildings, answering a question of Hutchings.
