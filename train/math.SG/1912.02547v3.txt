Let S be a closed orientable spin manifold. Let K \subset S be a submanifold and denote its complement by M_K. In this paper we prove that there exists an isomorphism between partially wrapped Floer cochains of a cotangent fiber stopped by the unit conormal \varLambda_K and chains of a Morse theoretic model of the based loop space of M_K, which intertwines the A_\infty-structure with the Pontryagin product. As an application, we restrict to codimension 2 spheres K \subset S^n where n = 5 or n\geq 7. Then we show that there is a family of knots K so that the partially wrapped Floer cohomology of a cotangent fiber is related to the Alexander invariant of K. A consequence of this relation is that the link \varLambda_K \cup \varLambda_x is not Legendrian isotopic to \varLambda_{\mathrm{unknot}} \cup \varLambda_x where x\in M_K.
