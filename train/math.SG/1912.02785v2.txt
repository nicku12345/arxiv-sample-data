We show that there exist symplectic structures on a \mathbb CP^1-bundle over \mathbb CP^2 that do not admit a compatible K\"ahler structure. These symplectic structures were originally constructed by Tolman and they have a Hamiltonian \mathbb T^2-symmetry. Tolman's manifold was shown to be diffeomorphic to a \mathbb CP^1-bundle over \mathbb CP^{2} by Goertsches, Konstantis, and Zoller. The proof of our result relies on Mori theory, and on classical facts about holomorphic vector bundles over \mathbb CP^{2}.
