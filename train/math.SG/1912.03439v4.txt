We prove an "h-principle without pre-conditions" for the elimination of tangencies of a Lagrangian submanifold with respect to a Lagrangian distribution. The main result states that the tangencies can always be completely removed at the cost of allowing the Lagrangian to develop certain non-smooth points, called Lagrangian ridges, modeled on the corner \{p = |q|\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2 together with its products and stabilizations.
