Let S be a compact oriented finite dimensional manifold and M a finite dimensional Riemannian manifold, let {\rm Imm}_f(S,M) the space of all free immersions \varphi:S \to M and let B^+_{i,f}(S,M) the quotient space {\rm Imm}_f(S,M)/{\rm Diff}^+(S), where {\rm Diff}^+(S) denotes the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of S. In this paper we prove that if M admits a parallel r-fold vector cross product \varphi \in \Omega ^r(M, TM) and \dim S = r-1 then B^+_{i,f}(S,M) is a formally K\"ahler manifold. This generalizes Brylinski's, LeBrun's and Verbitsky's results for the case that S is a codimension 2 submanifold in M, and S = S^1 or M is a torsion-free G_2-manifold respectively.
