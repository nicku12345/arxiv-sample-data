We introduce the notion of a point on a locally closed subset of a symplectic manifold being "locally rigid" with respect to that subset, prove that this notion is invariant under symplectic homeomorphisms, and show that coisotropic submanifolds are distinguished among all smooth submanifolds by the property that all of their points are locally rigid. This yields a simplified proof of the Humili\`ere-Leclercq-Seyfaddini theorem on the C^0-rigidity of coisotropic submanifolds. Connections are also made to the "rigid locus" that has previously been used in the study of Chekanov-Hofer pseudometrics on orbits of closed subsets under the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group.
