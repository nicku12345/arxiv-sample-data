Let (M,\omega_M) be a six dimensional closed monotone symplectic manifold admitting an effective semifree Hamiltonian S^1-action. We show that (M,\omega_M) is S^1-equivariant symplectomorphic to some K\"{a}hler Fano manifold (X,\omega_X, J) with a certain holomorphic \mathbb{C}^*-action. We also give a complete list of all such Fano manifolds and describe all semifree \mathbb{C}^*-actions on them specifically.
