We study a bordism relation for stable 3-forms on a 6-manifold, which is a binary relation on the set of closed SL(3;\mathbb{C})-structures on a 6-manifold via closed G_2-structures. Under SO(3)-symmetry and a co-associative condition the relation is reduced to a relation for geometric structures on a 3-manifold. Under these conditions we prove that the bordism relation is irreflexive and that the relation induces a more rigid one.
