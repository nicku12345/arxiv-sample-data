A contravariant pseudo-Hessian manifold is a manifold M endowed with a pair (\nabla,h) where \nabla is a flat connection and h is a symmetric bivector field satisfying a contravariant Codazzi equation. When h is invertible we recover the known notion of pseudo-Hessian manifold.   Contravariant pseudo-Hessian manifolds have properties similar to Poisson manifolds and, in fact, to any contravariant pseudo-Hessian manifold (M,\nabla,h) we associate naturally a Poisson tensor on TM. We investigate these properties and we study in details many classes of such structures in order to highlight the richness of the geometry of these manifolds.
