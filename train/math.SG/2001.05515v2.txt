We construct quantum K-invariants in non-archimedean analytic geometry. Our approach differs from the classical one in algebraic geometry via perfect obstruction theory. Instead, we build on our previous works on the foundation of derived non-archimedean geometry and Gromov compactness. We obtain a list of natural geometric relations of the stacks of stable maps, directly at the derived level, with respect to elementary operations on graphs, namely, products, cutting edges, forgetting tails and contracting edges. They imply immediately the corresponding properties of K-theoretic invariants. The derived approach produces highly intuitive statements and functorial proofs, without the need to manipulate perfect obstruction theories. The flexibility of our derived approach to quantum K-invariants allows us to impose not only simple incidence conditions for marked points, but also incidence conditions with multiplicities, which we discuss in the final section of the paper. This leads to a new set of enumerative invariants, which is not yet considered in the literature, to the best of our knowledge. For the proofs, we had to further develop the foundations of derived non-archimedean geometry in this paper: we study derived lci morphisms, relative analytification, and deformation to the normal bundle. Our motivations come from non-archimedean enumerative geometry and mirror symmetry.
