We give a characterisation of Atiyah's and Hitchin's transverse Hilbert schemes of points on a symplectic surface in terms of bi-Poisson structures. Furthermore, we describe the geometry of hyperk\"ahler manifolds arising from the transverse Hilbert scheme construction, with particular attention paid to the monopole moduli spaces.
