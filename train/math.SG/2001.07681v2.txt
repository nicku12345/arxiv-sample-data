We study Legendrian and transverse realizations of the negative torus knots T_{(p,-q)} in all contact structures on the 3-sphere. We give a complete classification of the strongly non-loose transverse realizations and the strongly non-loose Legendrian realizations with the Thurston-Bennequin invariant smaller than -pq.   Additionally, we study the Legendrian invariants of these knots in the minus version of the knot Floer homology, obtaining that U\cdot\mathfrak L(L) vanishes for any Legendrian negative torus knot L in any overtwisted structure, and that the strongly non-loose transverse realizations T are characterized by having non-zero invariant \mathfrak T(T).   Along the way, we relate our Legendrian realizations to the tight contact structures on the Legendrian surgeries along them. Specifically, we realize all tight structures on the lens spaces L(pq+1,p^2) as a single Legendrian surgery on a Legendrian T_{(p,-q)}, and we relate transverse realizations in overtwisted structures to the non-fillable tight structures on the large negative surgeries along the underlying knots.
