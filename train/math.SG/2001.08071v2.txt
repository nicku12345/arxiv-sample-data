We consider the base change action on real or complex representation spaces of quivers and the associated momentum map for a maximal compact subgroup of the base change group, as introduced by A. King. We give an explicit description of the momentum map image in terms of recursively defined inequalities on eigenvalues of Hermitian operators. Moreover, we characterize when the momentum map image is maximal possible, respectively of positive volume.
