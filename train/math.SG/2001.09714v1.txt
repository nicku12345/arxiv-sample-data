We study Reeb dynamics on the three-sphere equipped with a tight contact form and an anti-contact involution. We prove the existence of a symmetric periodic orbit and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for it to bound an invariant disk-like global surface of section. We also study the same questions under the presence of additional symmetry and obtain similar results in this case. The proofs make use of pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectizations. As applications, we study Birkhoff's conjecture on disk-like global surfaces of section in the planar circular restricted three-body problem and the existence of symmetric closed Finsler geodesics on the two-sphere. We also present applications to some classical Hamiltonian systems.
