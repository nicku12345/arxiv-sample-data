For a proper Hamiltonian action of a Lie group G on a K\"ahler manifold (X,\omega) with momentum map \mu we show that the symplectic reduction \mu^{-1}(0)/G is a normal complex space. Every point in \mu^{-1}(0) has a G-stable open neighborhood on which \omega and \mu are given by a G-invariant K\"ahler potential. This is used to show that \mu^{-1}(0)/G is a K\"ahler space. Furthermore we examine the existence of potentials away from \mu^{-1}(0) with both positive and negative results.
