We show that the metrisability of an oriented projective surface is equivalent to the existence of pseudo-holomorphic curves. A projective structure \mathfrak{p} and a volume form \sigma on an oriented surface M equip the total space of a certain disk bundle Z\to M with a pair (J_{\mathfrak{p}},\mathfrak{J}_{\mathfrak{p},\sigma}) of almost complex structures. A conformal structure on M corresponds to a section of Z\to M and \mathfrak{p} is metrisable by the metric g if and only if [g] : M \to Z is a pseudo-holomorphic curve with respect to J_{\mathfrak{p}} and \mathfrak{J}_{\mathfrak{p},dA_g}.
