We introduce a new invariant, the \textit{positive idempotent group}, for strongly asymptotically dynamically convex contact manifolds. This invariant can be used to distinguish different contact structures. As an application, for any complex dimension n>8 and any positive integer k, we can construct n-dimensional Stein manifolds V_0,V_1,\cdots,V_k such that \tilde{H}_j(V_i)=0, j\neq n-1,n, V_i's are almost symplectomorphic, their boundaries are in the same almost contact class but not contactomorphic.
