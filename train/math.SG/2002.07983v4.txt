In this article, we provide an introduction to an algorithm for constructing Weinstein handlebodies for complements of certain smoothed toric divisors using explicit coordinates and a simple example. This article also serves to welcome newcomers to Weinstein handlebody diagrams and Weinstein Kirby calculus. Finally, we include one complicated example at the end of the article to showcase the algorithm and the types of Weinstein Kirby diagrams it produces.
