In this paper, sufficient conditions for contact (+1)-surgeries along Legendrian knots in contact rational homology 3-spheres to have vanishing contact invariants or to be overtwisted are given. They can be applied to study contact (\pm1)-surgeries along Legendrian links in the standard contact 3-sphere. We also obtain a sufficient condition for contact (+1)-surgeries along Legendrian two-component links in the standard contact 3-sphere to be overtwisted via their front projections.
