We review the recent proof of the N.Takahashi's conjecture on genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants of (\mathbb{P}^2, E), where E is a smooth cubic curve in the complex projective plane \mathbb{P}^2. The main idea is the use of the algebraic notion of scattering diagram as a bridge between the world of Gromov-Witten invariants of (\mathbb{P}^2, E) and the world of moduli spaces of coherent sheaves on \mathbb{P}^2. Using this bridge, the N.Takahashi's conjecture can be translated into a manageable question about moduli spaces of coherent sheaves on \mathbb{P}^2.   This survey is based on a three hours lecture series given as part of the Beijing-Zurich moduli workshop in Beijing, 9-12 September 2019.
