Actions of U(n) on U(n+1) coadjoint orbits via embeddings of U(n) into U(n+1) are an important family of examples of multiplicity free spaces. They are related to Gelfand-Zeitlin completely integrable systems and multiplicity free branching rules in representation theory. This paper computes the Hamiltonian local normal forms of all such actions, at arbitrary points, in arbitrary U(n+1) coadjoint orbits. The results are described using combinatorics of interlacing patterns; gadgets that describe the associated Kirwan polytopes.
