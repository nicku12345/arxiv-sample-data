In this paper, we confirm a conjecture of Orlik-Randell from 1977 on the Seifert form of chain type invertible singularities. We use Lefschetz bifibration techniques as developed by Seidel (inspired by Arnold and Donaldson) and take advantage of the symmetries at hand. We believe that our method will be useful in understanding the homological/categorical version of Berglundt-Hubsch mirror conjecture for invertible singularities.
