Let M be complex projective manifold and A a positive line bundle on it. Assume that a compact and connected Lie group G acts on M in a Hamiltonian and holomorphic manner and that this action linearizes to A. Then, there is an associated unitary representation of G on the associated algebro-geometric Hardy space H(X). The standard circle action on H(X) commutes with the action of G and thus one has a decompositions labeled by (k\,\boldsymbol{\nu},\,k), where k\in\mathbb{Z} and \boldsymbol{ \nu }\in \hat{G}. We consider the local and global asymptotic properties of the corresponding equivariant projector as k goes to infinity. More generally, for a compact connected Lie group, we compute the asymptotics of the dimensions of the corresponding isotypes.
