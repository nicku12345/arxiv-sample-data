In this paper, we give a proof of homological mirror symmetry for two variable invertible polynomials, where the symmetry group on the B-side is taken to be maximal. The proof involves an explicit gluing construction of the Milnor fibres, and as an application, we prove derived equivalences between certain nodal stacky curves, some of whose irreducible components have non-trivial generic stabiliser.
