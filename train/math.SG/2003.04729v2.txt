If a contact form on a (2n+1)-dimensional closed contact manifold admits closed Reeb orbits, then its systolic ration is defined to be the quotient of (n+1)-th power of the shortest period of Reeb orbits by the contact volume. We prove that every co-oriented contact structure on any closed contact manifold admits a contact form with arbitrarily large systolic ratio. This statement generalizes the result of Abbondandolo et al. in dimension three to higher dimensions. The proof is inductive and uses the three dimensional result as its basis step and relies on the Giroux correspondence for the inductive step. The proof does not require any plug construction that is used by Abbondandolo et al. and by the author in the previous version of the proof.
