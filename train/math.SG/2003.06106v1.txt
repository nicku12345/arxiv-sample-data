Given a Lagrangian fibration, we construct a mirror Landau-Ginzburg model consisting of a rigid analytic space and a potential function, based on Fukaya's family Floer theory and non-archimedean tropical geometry. Locally, the potential is given by counting of Maslov-two disks and a local chart is the zero locus of weak Maurer-Cartan equations of an A_\infty algebra in the non-archimedean torus. The transition maps come from Fukaya's tricks and an A_\infty homomorphism; the related wall-crossing formula is also proved. The cocycle condition holds due to an improved A_\infty homotopy theory (adding divisor axioms and cyclical unitalities). A striking point of our approach is that the mirror analytic space on B-side is constructed purely in terms of Lagrangian Floer theory on A-side. We expect our construction gives a symplectic version of the Gross-Siebert's program.
