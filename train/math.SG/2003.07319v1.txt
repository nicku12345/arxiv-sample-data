We develop the Gompf fiber connected sum operation for symplectic orbifolds. We use it to construct a symplectic 4-orbifold with b_1=0 and containing symplectic surfaces of genus 1 and 2 that are disjoint and span the rational homology. This is used in turn to construct a K-contact Smale-Barden manifold with specified 2-homology that satisfies the known topological constraints with sharper estimates than the examples constructed previously. The manifold can be chosen spin or non-spin.
