The purpose of this paper is to describe a dictionary geometry <--> algebra in Lagrangian topology. As a by-product we obtain a tautological (in a sense explained in the body of the paper) proof of a folklore conjecture (sometimes attributed to Kontsevich) claiming that the objects and structure of the derived Fukaya category can be represented through immersed Lagrangians. Our construction is based on certain Lagrangian cobordism categories endowed with a structure called "surgery models".
