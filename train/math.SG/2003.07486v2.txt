This article uses relative symplectic cohomology, recently studied by the second author, to understand rigidity phenomena for compact subsets of symplectic manifolds. As an application, we consider a symplectic crossings divisor in a Calabi-Yau symplectic manifold M whose complement is a Liouville manifold. We show that, for a carefully chosen Liouville structure, the skeleton as a subset of M exhibits strong rigidity properties akin to super-heavy subsets of Entov-Polterovich. Along the way, we expand the toolkit of relative symplectic cohomology by introducing products and units. We also develop what we call the contact Fukaya trick, concerning the behaviour of relative symplectic cohomology of subsets with contact type boundary under adding a Liouville collar.
