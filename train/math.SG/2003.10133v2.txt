We show that the Hamiltonian action satisfies the Palais-Smale condition over a "mixed regularity" space of loops in cotangent bundles, namely the space of loops with regularity H^s, s\in (\frac 12, 1), in the base and H^{1-s} in the fiber direction. As an application, we give a simplified proof of a theorem of Hofer-Viterbo on the existence of closed characteristic leaves for certain contact type hypersufaces in cotangent bundles.
