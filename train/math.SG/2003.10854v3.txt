A strong version of a conjecture of Viterbo asserts that all normalized symplectic capacities agree on convex domains. We review known results showing that certain specific normalized symplectic capacities agree on convex domains. We also review why all normalized symplectic capacities agree on S^1-invariant convex domains. We introduce a new class of examples called "monotone toric domains", which are not necessarily convex, and which include all dynamically convex toric domains in four dimensions. We prove that for monotone toric domains in four dimensions, all normalized symplectic capacities agree. For monotone toric domains in arbitrary dimension, we prove that the Gromov width agrees with the first equivariant capacity. We also study a family of examples of non-monotone toric domains and determine when the conclusion of the strong Viterbo conjecture holds for these examples. Along the way we compute the cylindrical capacity of a large class of "weakly convex toric domains" in four dimensions.
