We classify fibrations of abstract 3-regular GKM graphs over 2-regular ones, and show that all fiberwise signed fibrations of this type are realized as the projectivization of equivariant complex rank 2 vector bundles over quasitoric 4-folds or S^4. We investigate the existence of invariant (stable) almost complex, symplectic, and K\"ahler structures on the total space. In this way we obtain infinitely many K\"ahler manifolds with Hamiltonian non-K\"ahler actions in dimension 6 with prescribed one-skeleton, in particular with prescribed number of isolated fixed points.
