Coadjoint orbits and multiplicity free spaces of compact Lie groups are important examples of symplectic manifolds with Hamiltonian groups actions. Constructing action-angle variables on these spaces is a challenging task. A fundamental result in the field is the Guillemin-Sternberg construction of Gelfand-Zeitlin integrable systems for the groups K=U(n), SO(n). Extending these results to groups of other types is one of the goals of this paper.   Partial tropicalizations are Poisson spaces with constant Poisson bracket built using techniques of Poisson-Lie theory and the geometric crystals of Berenstein-Kazhdan. They provide a bridge between dual spaces of Lie algebras {\rm Lie}(K)^* with linear Poisson brackets and polyhedral cones which parametrize the canonical bases of irreducible modules of G=K^\mathbb{C}.   We generalize the construction of partial tropicalizations to allow for arbitrary cluster charts, and apply it to questions in symplectic geometry. For each regular coadjoint orbit of a compact group K, we construct an exhaustion by symplectic embeddings of toric domains. As a by product we arrive at a conjectured formula for Gromov width of regular coadjoint orbits. We prove similar results for multiplicity free K-spaces.
