We construct pairs of surfaces in symplectic 4-manifolds that are topologically isotopic yet are not equivalent under any ambient diffeomorphism, including the first such examples of holomorphic disks in the 4-ball, symplectic 2-spheres, and symplectic surfaces of nonzero self-intersection, as well as Lagrangian 2-spheres that are homotopic but not topologically equivalent. The underlying construction provides infinitely many pairs of exotic ribbon disks in the 4-ball, and we provide an entirely topological exposition of such disks.
