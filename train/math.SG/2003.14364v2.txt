We present Hausdorff versions for Lie Integration Theorems 1 and 2 and apply them to study Hausdorff symplectic groupoids arising from Poisson manifolds. To prepare for these results we include a discussion on Lie equivalences and propose an algebraic approach to holonomy. We also include subsidiary results, such as a generalization of the integration of subalgebroids to the non-wide case, and explore in detail the case of foliation groupoids.
