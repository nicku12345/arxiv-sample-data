We introduce the notion of tropical Lagrangian multi-sections over any 2-dimensional integral affine manifold B with singularities, and use them to study the reconstruction problem for higher rank locally free sheaves over Calabi-Yau surfaces. To certain tropical Lagrangian multi-sections \mathbb{L} over B, which are explicitly constructed by prescribing local models around the ramification points, we associate locally free sheaves \mathcal{E}_0(\mathbb{L}) over the singular projective scheme X_0(B,\mathscr{P},s) associated to B equipped with a polyhedral decomposition \mathscr{P} and a gluing data s. We find combinatorial conditions on such an \mathbb{L} under which the sheaf \mathcal{E}_0(\mathbb{L}) is simple. This produces explicit examples of smoothable pairs (X_0(B,\mathscr{P},s),\mathcal{E}_0(\mathbb{L})) in dimension 2.
