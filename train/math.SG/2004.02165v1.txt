Inspired by the techniques of Givental and Th\'eret, we provide a proof with generating functions of a recent result of Ginzburg-G\"urel concerning the periodic points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of \mathbb{C}\text{P}^d. For instance, we are able to prove that fixed points of pseudo-rotations are isolated as invariant sets or that a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism with a hyperbolic fixed point has infinitely many periodic points.
