We present Hamiltonian formalism for the inverse problem having Dirac\ big-isotropic structures as underlying geometry. We used the same idea at [1] to treat replicator equations. Here we state the procedure used there for general vector fields that can be written in a gradient form. For a linear system, we show that if representing matrix of the system has at least one pair of positive-negative non-zero eigenvalues or in the case of eigenvalue zero, at least one three dimensional Jordan block associated to it, then the linear system has a Hamiltonian description with respect to a non-trivial Dirac\big-isotropic structure. More interestingly, we prove that every Hamiltonian linear system is Hamiltonian integrable. As a byproduct, we found a class of linear systems with eigenvalue zero that are Hamiltonian only with respect to a proper big-isotropic structure. Our approach also provides a clear picture for the alternative Hamiltonian descriptions of linear systems.
