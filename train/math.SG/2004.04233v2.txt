We study symplectic rigidity phenomena for fibers in cotangent bundles of Riemann surfaces. Our main result can be seen as a generalization to open Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus of work of Eliashberg and Polterovich on the Nearby Lagrangian Conjecture for T^* \mathbb{R}^2. As a corollary, we answer a strong version in dimension 2n=4 of a question of Eliashberg about linking of Lagrangian disks in T^* \mathbb{R}^n, which was previously answered by Ekholm and Smith in dimensions 2n \geq 8.
