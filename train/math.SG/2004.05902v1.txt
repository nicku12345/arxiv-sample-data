We introduce an A_\infty map from the cubical chain complex of the based loop space of Lagrangian submanifolds with Legendrian boundary in a Liouville Manifold C_{*}(\Omega_{L} \mathcal{L}\mathit{ag}) to wrapped Floer cohomology of Lagrangian submanifold \mathcal{CW}^{-*}(L,L). In the case of a cotangent bundle and a Lagrangian co-fiber, the composition of our map with a previously constructed map from \mathcal{CW}^*(L,L) \to C_{*}(\Omega_q Q)  shows that this map is split surjective.
