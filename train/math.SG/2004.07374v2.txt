We prove homological mirror symmetry for Milnor fibers of simple singularities in dimensions greater than one, which are among the log Fano cases of Conjecture 1.5 in arXiv:1806.04345. The proof is based on a relation between matrix factorizations and Calabi--Yau completions. As an application, we give an explicit computation of the Hochschild cohomology group of the derived n-preprojective algebra of a Dynkin quiver for any n \geq 1, and the symplectic cohomology group of the Milnor fiber of any simple singularity in any dimension greater than one.
