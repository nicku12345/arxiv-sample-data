We extend the notion of (smooth) stable generalized complex structures to allow for an anticanonical section with normal self-crossing singularities. This weakening not only allows for a number of natural examples in higher dimensions but also sheds some light into the smooth case in dimension four. We show that in four dimensions there is a natural connected sum operation for these structures as well as a smoothing operation which changes a self-crossing stable generalized complex structure into a smooth stable generalized complex structure on the same manifold. This allows us to construct large families of stable generalized complex manifolds.
