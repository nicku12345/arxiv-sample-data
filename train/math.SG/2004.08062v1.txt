In this paper, we study the fundamental groups of presymplectic Hamiltonian G-manifolds, G being a connected compact Lie group. A presymplectic manifold is foliated by the integral submanifolds of the kernel of the presymplectic form. Under a nice condition on the action, Lin and Sjamaar recently show that the moment map image of a presymplectic Hamiltonian G-manifold has the same "convex and polyhedral" property as the moment map image of a symplectic Hamiltonian G-manifold, a result proved independently by Atiyah, Guillemin-Sternberg, and Kirwan. Using this property, we study the differences and similarities on the fundamental groups of presymplectic and symplectic Hamiltonian G-manifolds. We observe that the results on the symplectic case are special cases of the results on the presymplectic case.
