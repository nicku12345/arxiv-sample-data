We investigate which orbits of an n-dimensional torus action on a 2n-dimensional toric K\"ahler manifold M are minimal. In other words, we study minimal submanifolds appearing as the fibres of the moment map on a toric K\"ahler manifold. Amongst other questions we investigate and give partial answers to the following: (1) How many such minimal Lagrangian tori exist? (2) Can their stability, as critical points of the area functional, be characterised just from the ambient geometry? (3) Given a toric symplectic manifold, for which sets of orbits S, is there a compatible toric K\"ahler metric whose set of minimal Lagrangian orbits is S?
