Reflections from hypersurfaces act by symplectomorphisms on the space of oriented lines with respect to the canonical symplectic form. We consider an arbitrary C^{\infty}-smooth hypersurface \gamma\subset\mathbb R^{n+1} that is either a global strictly convex closed hypersurface, or a germ of hypersurface. We deal with the pseudogroup generated by compositional ratios of reflections from \gamma and of reflections from its small deformations. In the case, when \gamma is a global convex hypersurface, we show that the latter pseudogroup is dense in the pseudogroup of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms between subdomains of the phase cylinder: the space of oriented lines intersecting \gamma transversally. We prove an analogous local result in the case, when \gamma is a germ. The derivatives of the above compositional differences in the deformation parameter are Hamiltonian vector fields calculated by Ron Perline. To prove the main results, we find the Lie algebra generated by them and prove its C^{\infty}-density in the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields. We also prove analogues of the above results for hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds.
