We prove that if there exists a c_1-preserving graded ring isomorphism between integral cohomology rings of two Fano Bott manifolds, then they are isomorphic as toric varieties. As a consequence, we give an affirmative answer to McDuff's question on the uniqueness of a toric structure on a Fano Bott manifold.
