This is an expanded version of the talk given be the first author at the conference "Topology, Geometry, and Dynamics: Rokhlin - 100". The purpose of this talk was to explain our current results on classification of rational symplectic 4-manifolds equipped with an anti-symplectic involution. Detailed exposition will appear elsewhere.
