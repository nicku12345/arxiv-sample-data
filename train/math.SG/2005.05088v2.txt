We study rational Lagrangian immersions in a cotangent bundle, based on the microlocal theory of sheaves. We construct a sheaf quantization of a rational Lagrangian immersion and investigate its properties in Tamarkin category. Using the sheaf quantization, we give an explicit bound for the displacement energy and a Betti/cup-length estimate for the number of the intersection points of the immersion and its Hamiltonian image by a purely sheaf-theoretic method.
