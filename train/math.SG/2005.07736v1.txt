In this note we study homological cycles in the mirror quintic Calabi-Yau threefold which can be realized by special Lagrangian submanifolds. We have used Picard-Lefschetz theory to establish the monodromy action and to study the orbit of Lagrangian vanishing cycles. For many prime numbers p we can compute the orbit modulo p. We conjecture that the orbit in homology with coefficients in \mathbb{Z} can be determined by these orbits with coefficients in \mathbb{Z}_p.
