We prove an equivalence between the superpotential defined via tropical geometry and Lagrangian Floer theory for special Lagrangian torus fibres in del Pezzo surfaces constructed by Collins-Jacob-Lin. We also include some explicit calculations for the projective plane, which confirm some folklore conjecture in this case.
