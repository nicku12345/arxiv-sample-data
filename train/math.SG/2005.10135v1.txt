We prove some contact analogs of smooth embedding theorems for closed \pi-manifolds. We show that a closed, k-connected, \pi-manifold of dimension (2n + 1) that bounds a \pi-manifold, contact embeds in the (4n-2k+3)-dimensional Euclidean space with the standard contact structure. We also prove some isocontact embedding results for \pi-manifolds and parallelizable manifolds.
