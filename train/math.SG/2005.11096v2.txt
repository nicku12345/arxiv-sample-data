We study the Floer-theoretic interaction between disjointly supported Hamiltonians by comparing Floer-theoretic invariants of these Hamiltonians with the ones of their sum. These invariants include spectral invariants, boundary depth and Abbondandolo-Haug-Schlenk's action selector. Additionally, our method shows that in certain situations the spectral invariants of a Hamiltonian supported in an open subset of a symplectic manifold are independent of the ambient manifold.
