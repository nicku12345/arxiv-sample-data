Let \Lambda^{\pm} = \Lambda^{+} \cup \Lambda^{-} \subset (\mathbb{R}^{3}, \xi_{std}) be a contact surgery diagram determining a closed, connected contact 3-manifold (S^{3}_{\Lambda^{\pm}}, \xi_{\Lambda^{\pm}}) and an open contact manifold (\mathbb{R}^{3}_{\Lambda^{\pm}}, \xi_{\Lambda^{\pm}}). Following arXiv:0911.0026 and arXiv:1906.07228 we demonstrate how \Lambda^{\pm} determines a family \alpha_{\epsilon} of standard-at-infinity contact forms on (\mathbb{R}^{3}_{\Lambda^{\pm}}, \xi_{\Lambda^{\pm}}) whose closed Reeb orbits are in one-to-one correspondence with cyclic words of composable Reeb chords on \Lambda^{\pm}.   We compute the homology classes and integral Conley-Zehnder indices of these orbits diagrammatically using a simultaneous framing of all orbits naturally determined by the surgery diagram, providing a (typically non-canonical) \mathbb{Z}-grading on the chain complexes underlying the "hat" version of contact homology as defined in arXiv:1004.2942. Using holomorphic foliations, algebraic tools for studying holomorphic curves in symplectizations of and surgery cobordisms between the (\mathbb{R}^{3}_{\Lambda^{\pm}}, \xi_{\Lambda^{\pm}}) are developed.   We use these computational tools to provide the first examples of closed, tight, contact manifolds with vanishing contact homology -- contact \frac{1}{k} surgeries along the right-handed, tb=1 trefoil for k > 0, which are known to have non-zero Heegaard-Floer contact classes by arXiv:math/0404135.
