Let \Lambda, \Lambda' be a pair of closed Legendrian submanifolds in a closed contact manifold (Y, \xi = Ker(\alpha)) related by a Legendrian cobordism W\subset (\mathbb{C}\times Y, \tilde{\xi}=Ker(-y dx +\alpha)). In this note, we show that in the hypertight setting, if \Lambda intersects a closed, weakly exact or monotone pre-Lagrangian P\subset Y for reasons of Floer homology, then so does \Lambda'.
