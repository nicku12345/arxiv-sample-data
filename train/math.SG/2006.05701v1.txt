The goal of this paper is to set up the general framework of higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology, define the contact class, and use it to give an obstruction to the Liouville fillability of a contact manifold and a sufficient condition for the Weinstein conjecture to hold. We discuss several classes of examples including those coming from analyzing a close cousin of symplectic Khovanov homology and the analog of the Plamenevskaya invariant of transverse links.
