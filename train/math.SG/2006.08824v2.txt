We present an elementary computational scheme for the moduli spaces of rational pseudo-holomorphic curves in the symplectizations of 3-dimensional lens spaces, which are equipped with Morse-Bott contact forms induced by the standard Morse-Bott contact form on S^3. As an application, we prove that for p prime and 1<q,q'<p-1, if there is a contactomorphism between lens spaces L(p,q) and L(p,q'), where both spaces are equipped with their standard contact structures, then q\equiv (q')^{\pm 1} in\mod p. For the proof we study the moduli spaces of pair of pants with two non-contractible ends in detail and establish that the standard almost complex structure that is used is regular. Then the existence of a contactomorphism enables us to follow a neck-stretching process, by means of which we compare the homotopy relations encoded at the non-contractible ends of the pair of pants in the symplectizations of L(p,q) and L(p,q'). Combining our proof with the result of Honda on the classification of universally tight contact structures on lens spaces, we provide a purely symplectic/contact topological proof of the diffeomorphism classification of lens spaces in the class mentioned above
