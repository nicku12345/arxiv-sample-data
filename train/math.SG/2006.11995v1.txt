We show that symplectically aspherical/Calabi-Yau filling of Y:=\partial(V\times \mathbb{D}) has vanishing symplectic cohomology for any Liouville domain V, in particular, we make no topological requirement on the filling and c_1(V) can be nonzero. Moreover, we show that for any symplectically aspherical/Calabi-Yau filling W of Y, the interior \mathring{W} is diffeomorphic to the interior of V\times \mathbb{D} if \pi_1(Y) is abelian and \dim V\ge 4. And W is diffeomorphic to V\times \mathbb{D} if moreover the Whitehead group of \pi_1(Y) is trivial.
