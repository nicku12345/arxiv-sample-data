We introduce the Hopf correspondence, a Lagrangian correspondence aimed at assigning Lagrangian spheres L_1, \dots , L_m of a Liouville manifold (Y, \Omega) to given Lagrangian (real, complex, quaternionic) projective spaces K_1, \dots , K_m of a Liouville manifold (X, \omega). When this correspondence can be established, it intertwines the (real, complex, quaternionic) projective twists \tau_{K_i} \in \pi_{0}(\mathrm{Symp}_{ct}(X)) (and the induced autoequivalences of the compact Fukaya category \mathcal{F}uk(X)) with the Dehn twists \tau_{L_i} \in \pi_{0}(\mathrm{Symp}_{ct}(Y)) (and the corresponding autoequivalences induced on \mathcal{F}uk(Y)), for i=1, \dots m. Using the Hopf correspondence, we obtain a free generation result for projective twists in a clean Lagrangian plumbing of projective spaces and various results about products of positive powers of Dehn/projective twists in Liouville manifolds. The same techniques are also used to show the existence of exotic projective twists in \mathrm{Symp}_{ct}(T^*\mathbb{CP}^n) (in infinitely many dimensions n); projective twists arising from a different choice of smooth parametrisation of a Lagrangian projective space. Another application of the Hopf correspondence delivers two examples of smooth homotopy complex projective spaces that do not admit Lagrangian embeddings into (T^*\mathbb{CP}^n, d\lambda_{\mathbb{CP}^n}), for n=4,7.
