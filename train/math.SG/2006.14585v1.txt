We show that a quasipositive surface with disconnected boundary induces a map between the knot Floer homology groups of its boundary components preserving the transverse invariant. As an application, we show that this invariant can be used to obstruct decomposable Lagrangian cobordisms of arbitrary genus within Weinstein cobordisms. The construction of our maps rely on the comultiplicativity of the transverse invariant. Along the way, we also recover various naturality statements for the invariant under contact +1 surgery.
