For a Legendrian link \Lambda \subset J^1M with M = \mathbb{R} or S^1, immersed exact Lagrangian fillings L \subset \mbox{Symp}(J^1M) \cong T^*(\mathbb{R}_{>0} \times M) of \Lambda can be lifted to conical Legendrian fillings \Sigma \subset J^1(\mathbb{R}_{>0} \times M) of \Lambda. When \Sigma is embedded, using the version of functoriality for Legendrian contact homology (LCH) from [30], for each augmentation \alpha: \mathcal{A}(\Sigma) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/2 of the LCH algebra of \Sigma, there is an induced augmentation \epsilon_{(\Sigma,\alpha)}: \mathcal{A}(\Lambda) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/2. With \Sigma fixed, the set of homotopy classes of all such induced augmentations, I_\Sigma \subset \mathit{Aug}(\Lambda)/{\sim}, is a Legendrian isotopy invariant of \Sigma. We establish methods to compute I_\Sigma based on the correspondence between Morse complex families and augmentations. This includes developing a functoriality for the cellular DGA from [31] with respect to Legendrian cobordisms, and proving its equivalence to the functoriality for LCH. For arbitrary n \geq 1, we give examples of Legendrian torus knots with 2n distinct conical Legendrian fillings distinguished by their induced augmentation sets.   We prove that when \rho \neq 1 and \Lambda \subset J^1\mathbb{R} every \rho-graded augmentation of \Lambda can be induced in this manner by an immersed Lagrangian filling. Alternatively, this is viewed as a computation of cobordism classes for an appropriate notion of \rho-graded augmented Legendrian cobordism.
