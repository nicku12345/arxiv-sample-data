We compute the Rabinowitz Floer homology for a class of non-compact hyperboloids \Sigma\simeq S^{n+k-1}\times\mathbb{R}^{n-k}. Using an embedding of a compact sphere \Sigma_0\simeq S^{2k-1} into the hypersurface \Sigma, we construct a chain map from the Floer complex of \Sigma to the Floer complex of \Sigma_0. In contrast to the compact case, the Rabinowitz Floer homology groups of \Sigma are both non-zero and not equal to its singular homology. As a consequence, we deduce that the Weinstein Conjecture holds for any strongly tentacular deformation of such a hyperboloid.
