Let \Lambda be a link of Legendrian spheres in the boundary of a subcritical Weinstein manifold X. We show that the computation of the Legendrian contact homology of \Lambda can be reduced to a computation of Legendrian contact homology in 1--jet spaces. Since the Legendrian contact homology in 1-jet spaces is well studied, this gives a simplified way to compute the Legendrian contact homology of \Lambda. We restrict to the case when the attaching spheres of the subcritical handles of X do not interact with each other, and we will only consider mod 2 coefficients for now. The more general situation will be addressed in a forthcoming paper. As an application we compute the homology of the free loop space of \mathbb{CP}^2.
