The coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups each carry a canonical (positive definite) K\"ahler structure, famously used to realize the group's irreducible representations in holomorphic sections of appropriate line bundles (Borel-Weil theorem). Less studied are the (indefinite) invariant *pseudo*-K\"ahler structures they also admit, which can be used to realize the same representations in higher cohomology of the sections (Bott's theorem). Using ``eigenflag'' embeddings, we give a very explicit description of these metrics in the case of the unitary group. As a byproduct we show that U_n/(U_{n_1}\times\cdots\times U_{n_k}) has exactly k! invariant complex structures, a count which seems to have hitherto escaped attention.
