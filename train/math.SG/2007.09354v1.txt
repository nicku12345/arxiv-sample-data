Let M be a closed manifold and \mathcal{A} \subseteq H^1_{\mathrm{dR}}(M) a polytope. For each a \in \mathcal{A} we define a Novikov chain complex with a multiple finiteness condition encoded by the polytope \mathcal{A}. The resulting polytope Novikov homology generalizes the ordinary Novikov homology. We prove that any two cohomology classes in a prescribed polytope give rise to chain homotopy equivalent polytope Novikov complexes over a Novikov ring associated to said polytope. As applications we present a novel approach to the (twisted) Novikov Morse Homology Theorem and prove a new polytope Novikov Principle. The latter generalizes the ordinary Novikov Principle and a recent result of Pajitnov in the abelian case.
