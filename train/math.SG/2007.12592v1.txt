In an earlier paper, the second author resolved a question of McDuff by constructing a non-Hamiltonian symplectic circle action on a closed, connected six-dimensional symplectic manifold with exactly 32 fixed points. In this paper, we improve on this example by reducing the number of fixed points. More concretely, we construct a non-Hamiltonian symplectic circle action on a closed, connected six-dimensional symplectic manifold with exactly 2k fixed points for any k \geq 5.
