We give a coadjoint orbit's diffeomorphic deformation between the classical semisimple case and the semi-direct product given by a Cartan decomposition. The two structures admit the Hermitian symplectic form defined in a semisimple complex Lie algebra. We provide some applications such as the constructions of Lagrangian submanifolds.
