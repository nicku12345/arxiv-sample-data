We assume that M is a closed symplectic manifold, diffeomorphic to a complete intersection of complex dimension 4m, having a Hamiltonian S^{1}-action with finite fixed point set. We show that M is diffeomorphic to a \mathbb{CP}^{4m}, a quadric Q \subset \mathbb{CP}^{4m+1}or an intersection of 2 quadrics Q_{1} \cap Q_{2} \subset \mathbb{C P}^{4m + 2}.   We also prove the statement under a weaker assumption on the fixed point set, namely if components of the fixed point set are isolated points or submanifolds with real dimension not divisible by 4.
