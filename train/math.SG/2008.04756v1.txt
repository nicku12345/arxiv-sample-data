Let N be a closed manifold and U \subset T^*(N) a bounded domain in the cotangent bundle of N, containing the zero-section. A conjecture due to Viterbo asserts that the spectral metric for Lagrangian submanifolds that are exact-isotopic to the zero-section is bounded. In this paper we establish an upper bound on the spectral distance between two such Lagrangians L_0, L_1, which depends linearly on the boundary depth of the Floer complexes of (L_0, F) and (L_1, F), where F is a fiber of the cotangent bundle.
