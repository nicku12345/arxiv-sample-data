Let (S^2,\omega) be a symplectic sphere, and let \tau \colon S^2 \to S^2 be an anti-symplectic involution of (S^2,\omega). We consider the product (S^2,\omega) \times (S^2,\omega) endowed with the anti-symplectic involution \tau \times \tau, and study the space of monotone anti-invariant symplectic forms on this four-manifold. We show that this space is disconnected. In addition, during the course of the proof, we produce a diffeomorphism of the grassmannian (2,4) which induces the identity map on all homology and homotopy groups, but which is not homotopic to the identity.
