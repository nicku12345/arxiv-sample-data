We initiate the study of multiplicative structures on cones and show that cones of Floer continuation maps fit naturally in this framework. We apply this to describe the multiplicative structure on Rabinowitz Floer homology via cones and we reprove the Poincar\'e duality theorem from this perspective. We generalize the splitting theorem previously proved in the context of cotangent bundles to large classes of Weinstein domains. We express the mixed cap products in string topology in terms of loop products and coproducts, and we describe extended loop homology entirely in terms of Morse homology. The paper contains three appendices. The first one discusses multilinear shifts in a multilinear setting. The second one, of operadic flavor, discusses sign conventions and the language of trees to describe algebraic operations in a dg setting. The third one contains a description of the product on extended loop homology in the language of Morse theory and cones.
