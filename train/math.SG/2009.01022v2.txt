In this paper, we construct a group three-cocycle on the symplectomorphism group of a one-connected and integral symplectic manifold. This group cocycle is similar to the group two-cocycle introduced by Ismagilov, Losik, and Michor in 2006. Moreover, we show that the group cohomology class of the cocycle is equal to the universal Dixmier-Douady class of flat Symplectic fibrations.
