This paper is devoted to deformations of Lagrangian submanifolds contained in the singular locus of a log-symplectic manifold. We prove a normal form result for the log-symplectic structure around such a Lagrangian, which we use to extract algebraic and geometric information about the Lagrangian deformations. We show that the deformation problem is governed by a DGLA, we discuss whether the Lagrangian admits deformations not contained in the singular locus, and we give precise criteria for unobstructedness of first order deformations. We also address equivalences of deformations, showing that the gauge equivalence relation of the DGLA corresponds with the geometric notion of equivalence by Hamiltonian isotopies. We discuss the corresponding moduli space, and we prove a rigidity statement for the more flexible equivalence relation by Poisson isotopies.
