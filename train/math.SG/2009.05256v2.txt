An oriented equator of \mathbb{S}^2 is the image of an oriented embedding \mathbb{S}^1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{S}^2 such that it divides \mathbb{S}^2 into two equal area halves. Following Chekanov, we define the Hofer distance between two oriented equators as the infimal Hofer norm of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism taking one to another. Consider \mathcal{E}q_+ the space of oriented equators. We define the Hofer girth of an embedding j:\mathbb{S}^2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}q_+ as the infimum of the Hofer diameter of j'(\mathbb{S}^2), where j' is homotopic to j. There is a natural embedding i_0:\mathbb{S}^2\hookrightarrow\mathcal{E}q_+, sending a point on the sphere to the positively oriented great circle perpendicular to it. In this paper we provide an upper bound on the Hofer girth of i_0.
