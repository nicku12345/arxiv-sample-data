Extracting isolated rays from a symplectic manifold result in a manifold symplectomorphic to the initial one. The same holds for higher dimensional parametrized rays under an additional condition. More precisely, let (M,\omega) be a symplectic manifold. Let [0,\infty)\times Q\subset\mathbb{R}\times Q be considered as parametrized rays [0,\infty) and let \varphi:[-1,\infty)\times Q\to M be an injective, proper, continuous map immersive on (-1,\infty)\times Q. If for the standard vector field \frac{\partial}{\partial t} on \mathbb{R} and any further vector field \nu tangent to (-1,\infty)\times Q the equation \varphi^*\omega(\frac{\partial}{\partial t},\nu)=0 holds then M and M\setminus \varphi([0,\infty)\times Q) are symplectomorphic.
