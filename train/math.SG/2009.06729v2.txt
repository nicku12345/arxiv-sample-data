We study the action of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a compact symplectic manifold (X,\omega) on C^\infty(X) and on functions C^\infty(X)\to \mathbb R. We describe various properties of invariant convex functions on C^\infty(X). Among other things we show that continuous convex functions C^\infty(X)\to \mathbb R that are invariant under the action are automatically invariant under so called strict rearrangements and they are continuous in the sup norm topology of C^\infty(X); but this is not generally true if the convexity condition is dropped.
