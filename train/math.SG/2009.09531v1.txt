We study relative Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces and define relative invariants for a pair (X,\Sigma) consisting of a smooth, closed, oriented 4-manifold X and a smooth, closed, oriented 2-dimensional submanifold \Sigma\!\subset\!X with positive genus. These relative Seiberg-Witten invariants are meant to be the counterparts of relative Gromov-Witten invariants. We also obtain a sum formula (aka a product formula) that relates the SW invariants of a sum X of two closed oriented 4-manifolds X_1 and X_2 along a common oriented surface \Sigma with dual self-intersections to the relative SW invariants of (X_1,\Sigma) and (X_2,\Sigma). Our formula generalizes Morgan-Szab\'o-Taubes' product formula.
