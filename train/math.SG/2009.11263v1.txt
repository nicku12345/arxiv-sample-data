In this paper, we establish a version of the adjunction inequality for closed symplectic 4-manifolds. As in a previous paper on the Thom conjecture, we use contact geometry and trisections of 4-manifolds to reduce this inequality to the slice-Bennequin inequality for knots in the 4-ball. As this latter result can be proved using Khovanov homology, we completely avoid gauge theoretic techniques. This inequality can be used to give gauge-theory-free proofs of several landmark results in 4-manifold topology, such as detecting exotic smooth structures, the symplectic Thom conjecture, and exluding connected sum decompositions of certain symplectic 4-manifolds.
