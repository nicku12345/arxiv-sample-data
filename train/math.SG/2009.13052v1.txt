We give a different and simpler proof of a slightly modified (and weaker) variant of a recent theorem of Shelukhin extending Franks' "two-or-infinitely-many" theorem to Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms in higher dimensions and establishing a sufficiently general case of the Hofer-Zehnder conjecture. A few ingredients of our proof are common with Shelukhin's original argument, the key of which is Seidel's equivariant pair-of-pants product, but the new proof highlights a different aspect of the periodic orbit dynamics of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms.
