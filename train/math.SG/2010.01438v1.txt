In this paper we prove two isomorphisms in the local symplectic homology of a simple, which is to say non iterated, isolated Reeb orbit. The isomorphisms are in S^1-equivariant and nonequivariant symplectic homology, relating the local Floer homology group of the orbit to that of the return map. The isomorphism we prove in S^1-equivariant symplectic homology can be stated succinctly as the local S^1-equivariant symplectic homology of a simple isolated Reeb orbit is isomorphic to the local Hamiltonian Floer homology of the return map. We also prove the equivalence of two different definitions of a Reeb orbit being a symplectically degenerate maximum.
