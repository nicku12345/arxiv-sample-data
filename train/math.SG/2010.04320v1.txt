The earring tangle consists of four strands 4pt x [0,1] inside S^2 x [0,1] and one meridian around one of the strands. Equipping this tangle with a nontrivial SO(3) bundle, we show that its traceless SU(2) flat moduli space is topologically a smooth genus three surface. We also show that the restriction map from this surface to the traceless flat moduli space of the boundary of the earring tangle is a particular Lagrangian immersion into the product of two pillowcases. The latter computation suggests that figure eight bubbling---a subtle degeneration phenomenon predicted by Bottman and Wehrheim---appears in the context of traceless character varieties.
