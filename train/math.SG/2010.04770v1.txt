We introduce the notion of b-Lie group as a pair (G,H) where G is a Lie group and H is a codimension-one Lie subgroup, and study the associated canonical b-symplectic structure on the b-cotangent bundle ^b {T}^\ast G together with its reduction theory. Namely, we prove that the Poisson reduction under the cotangent lifted action of H by left translations is globally isomorphic to a product of the minus Lie Poisson structure on \mathfrak{h}^\ast (where \mathfrak{h} is the Lie algebra of H) and the canonical b-symplectic structure on ^b {T}^\ast(G/H), where G/H is viewed as a one-dimensional b-manifold having as critical hypersurface (in the sense of b-manifolds) the identity element.
