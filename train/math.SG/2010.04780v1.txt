In this paper we look at the question of integrability, or not, of the two natural almost complex structures J^{\pm}_\nabla defined on the twistor space J(M,g) of an even-dimensional manifold M with additional structures g and \nabla a g-connection. We also look at the question of the compatibility of J^{\pm}_\nabla with a natural closed 2-form \omega^{J(M,g,\nabla)} defined on J(M,g). For (M,g) we consider either a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, orientable or not, with the Levi Civita connection or a symplectic manifold with a given symplectic connection \nabla. In all cases J(M,g) is a bundle of complex structures on the tangent spaces of M compatible with g and we denote by \pi \colon J(M,g) \longrightarrow M the bundle projection. In the case M is oriented we require the orientation of the complex structures to be the given one. In the symplectic case the complex structures are positive.
