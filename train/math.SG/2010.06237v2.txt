We prove that toric symplectic manifolds admit Hamiltonian pseudo-rotations with a finite, and in a sense minimal, number of ergodic measures. The set of ergodic measures of these pseudo-rotations consists of the measure induced by the symplectic volume form and the Dirac measures supported at the fixed points of the torus action. Our construction relies on the conjugation method of Anosov and Katok.
