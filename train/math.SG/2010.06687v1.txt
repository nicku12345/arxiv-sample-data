We obtain new sharp obstructions to symplectic embeddings of four-dimensional polydisks P(a, 1) into four-dimensional ellisoids E(bc, c) when 1 \leq a < 2 and b is a half-integer. We demonstrate that P(a,1) symplectically embeds into E(bc,c) if and only if a + b \leq bc, showing that inclusion is optimal and extending the result by Hutchings [Hu16] when b is an integer. Our proof is based on a combinatorial criterion developed by Hutchings [Hu16] to obstruct symplectic embeddings. We additionally show that the range of a and b cannot be extended further using the Hutchings criterion.
