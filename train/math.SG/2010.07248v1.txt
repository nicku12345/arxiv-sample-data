We re-prove Gromov's non-squeezing theorem by applying Polyfold Theory to a simple Gromov-Witten moduli space. Thus we demonstrate how to utilize the work of Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder to give proofs involving moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves that are relatively short and broadly accessible, while also fully detailed and rigorous. We moreover review the polyfold description of Gromov-Witten moduli spaces in the relevant case of spheres with minimal energy and one marked point.
