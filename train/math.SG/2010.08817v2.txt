We study homological mirror symmetry for toric varieties, exploring the relationship between various Fukaya-Seidel categories which have been employed for constructing the mirror to a toric variety, and studying functoriality properties between these categories. In particular, we realize tropical Lagrangian sections as objects of a partially wrapped category and construct a Lagrangian correspondence mirror to the inclusion of a toric divisor. As a corollary, we prove that tropical sections generate the Fukaya-Seidel category, completing a Floer-theoretic proof of homological mirror symmetry for projective toric varieties. In the course of the proof, we develop techniques for constructing Lagrangian cobordisms and Lagrangian correspondences in Liouville domains, which may be of independent interest.
