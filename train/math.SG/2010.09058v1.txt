Appropriate submanifolds of a Poisson manifold have an induced Poisson structure. The first part of this paper discusses how certain Poisson-theoretic properties of such submanifolds and the ambient Poisson manifold are related; a distinguished r\^ole will be played by the so-called coregular submanifolds. The main objective of this paper is to analyze in detail Poisson submersions whose fibers are coregular submanifolds, and to present instances in which such coregular Poisson submersions appear.
