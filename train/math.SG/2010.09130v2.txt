We prove two inequalities for the complex orientations of a separating (Type I) non-singular real algebraic curve in RP^2 of any odd degree. We also construct a separating non-singular pseudoholomorphic curve in RP^2 of any degree congruent to 9 mod 12 which does not satisfies one of these inequalities. Therefore the oriented isotopy type of the real locus of each of these curves is algebraically unrealizable.
