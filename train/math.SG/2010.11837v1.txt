We describe how categorical BPS data including chain complexes of solitons, CPT pairings, and interior amplitudes jump across a wall of marginal stability in two-dimensional \mathcal{N}=(2,2) models. We show that our jump formulas hold if and only if the A_{\infty}-categories of half-BPS branes constructed on either side of the wall are homotopy equivalent. These results can be viewed as categorical enhancements of the Cecotti-Vafa wall-crossing formula.
