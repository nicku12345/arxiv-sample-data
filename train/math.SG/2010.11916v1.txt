We develop techniques to construct explicit symplectic Lefschetz fibrations over the 2-sphere with any prescribed signature and any spin type when the signature is divisible by 16. This solves a long-standing conjecture on the existence of such fibrations with positive signature. As applications, we produce symplectic 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to connected sums of S^2 x S^2, with the smallest topology known to date, as well as larger examples as symplectic Lefschetz fibrations.
