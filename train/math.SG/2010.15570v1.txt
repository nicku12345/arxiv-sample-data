We prove the conjecture of Yank{\i} Lekili and Kazushi Ueda on homological mirror symmetry for Milnor fibers of Berglund-H\"ubsch invertible polynomials. The proof proceeds as usual by calculating the "very affine" Fukaya category and then deforming it, relating the local categorical deformations to a calculation of David Nadler. The proof may be understood as a basic calculation in the deformation theory of perverse schobers.
