k-Para-K\"ahler Lie algebras are a generalization of para-K\"ahler Lie algebras (k=1) and constitute a subclass of k-symplectic Lie algebras. In this paper, we show that the characterization of para-K\"ahler Lie algebras as left symmetric bialgebras can be generalized to k-para-K\"ahler Lie algebras leading to the introduction of two new structures which are different but both generalize the notion of left symmetric algebra. This permits also the introduction of generalized S-matrices.   We determine then all the k-symplectic Lie algebras of dimension (k+1) and all the six dimensional 2-para-K\"ahler Lie algebras.
