We perform a test of the Gamma Conjecture in the setting of local mirror symmetry. Given a coherent sheaf on the canonical bundle of a smooth toric surface defined by an ample curve, we identify a 3-cycle in the mirror by lifting a tropical 1-cycle in the base space and compute its period. We show that this period agrees with the central charge of the given coherent sheaf, as conjectured by Hosono.
