We prove that any weakly symplectically fillable contact manifold is tight. Furthermore we verify the strong Weinstein conjecture for contact manifolds that appear as the concave boundary of a directed symplectic cobordism whose positive boundary satisfies the weak-filling condition and is overtwisted. The results are obtained via polyfolds.
