Motivated rational homotopy theory, we consider a class of Liouville manifolds which we call "algebraically hyperbolic". These Liouville manifolds are characterized by the property that (the pre-triangulated closure of) their wrapped Fukaya category has exponential algebraic growth, in a sense which we define. On the one hand, we prove that the class of algebraically hyperbolic Liouville manifolds is closed under various natural geometric operations, which allows one to construct many examples. On the other hand, under certain non-degeneracy hypotheses, we prove that Reeb flows on the ideal boundary of an algebraically hyperbolic Liouville manifold are always chaotic. This leads to various concrete applications, including new constructions of Weinstein manifolds which are not algebraic varieties and of contact manifolds whose Reeb flows have positive topological entropy. In dimension 3, the latter property implies a strong form of the Weinstein conjecture. Finally, we consider algebraically hyperbolic Weinstein manifolds from the perspective of their skeleton. In particular, we describe concrete criteria at the level of the skeleton which ensure that a Weinstein manifold is algebraically hyperbolic. This provides some connection between stratified-topological properties of skeleta of Weinstein manifolds and Reeb dynamics on their ideal boundary.
