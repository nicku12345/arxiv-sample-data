Consider (\mathbb{C}^*)^k acting on \mathbb{C}^N satisfying certain 'quasi-symmetric' condition which produces a class of toric Calabi-Yau GIT quotient stacks. Using subcategories of Coh([\mathbb{C}^N / (\mathbb{C}^*)^k]) generated by line bundles whose weights are inside certain zonotope called the 'magic window', Halpern-Leistner and Sam give a combinatorial construction of equivalences between derived categories of coherent sheaves for various GIT quotients. We apply the coherent-constructible correspondence for toric varieties to the magic windows and obtain a non-characteristic deformation of Lagrangian skeletons in \mathbb{R}^{N-k} parameterized by \mathbb{R}^k, exhibiting derived equivalences between A-models of the various phases. Moreover, by translating the magic window zonotope in \mathbb{R}^k, we obtain a universal skeleton over \mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{R}^k \setminus \mathcal{D} for some fattening of hyperplane arrangements \mathcal{D}, and we show that the the universal skeleton induces a local system of categories over \mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{R}^k \setminus \mathcal{D}. We also connect our results to the perverse schober structure identified by \v{S}penko and Van den Bergh.
