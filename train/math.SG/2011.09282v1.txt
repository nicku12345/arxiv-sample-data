The first part of this paper is a generalization of the Feix-Kaledin theorem on the existence of a hyperkahler metric on a neighbourhood of the zero section of the cotangent bundle of a Kahler manifold. We show that the problem of constructing a hyperkahler structure on a neighbourhood of a complex Lagrangian submanifold in a holomorphic symplectic manifold reduces to the existence of certain deformations of holomorphic symplectic structures. The Feix-Kaledin structure is recovered from the twisted cotangent bundle. We then show that every holomorphic symplectic groupoid over a compact holomorphic Poisson surface of Kahler type has a hyperkahler structure on a neighbourhood of its identity section. More generally, we reduce the existence of a hyperkahler structure on a symplectic realization of a holomorphic Poisson manifold of any dimension to the existence of certain deformations of holomorphic Poisson structures adapted from Hitchin's unobstructedness theorem.
