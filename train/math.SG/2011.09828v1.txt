We determine the Hofer-Zehnder capacity for twisted tangent bundles over closed surfaces for (i) arbitrary constant magnetic fields on the two-sphere and (ii) strong constant magnetic fields for higher genus surfaces. On S^2 we further give an explicit \text{SO}(3)-equivariant compactification of the twisted tangent bundle to S^2\times S^2 with split symplectic form. The former is the phase space of a charged particle moving on the two-sphere in a constant magnetic field, the latter is the configuration space of two massless coupled angular momenta.
