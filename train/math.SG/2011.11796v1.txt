In this work we study the integrability of quotients of quasi-Poisson manifolds. Our approach allows us to put several classical results about the integrability of Poisson quotients in a common framework. By categorifying one of the already known methods of reducing symplectic groupoids we also describe double symplectic groupoids which integrate the recently introduced Poisson groupoid structures on gauge groupoids.
