We study the geometric quantization on K3 surfaces from the viewpoint of the spectral convergence. We take a special Lagrangian fibrations on the K3 surfaces and a family of hyper-K\"ahler structures tending to large complex structure limit, and show a spectral convergence of the \bar{\partial}-Laplacians on the prequantum line bundle to the spectral structure related to the set of Bohr-Sommerfeld fibers.
