We prove that Legendrian and transverse links in overtwisted contact structures having overtwisted complements can be classified coarsely by their classical invariants. We further prove that any coarse equivalence class of Legendrian loose links has support genus zero. We also find a relationship between the support genus of the transverse link and its Legendrian approximation. As a corollary to this, we show that loose, null-homologous, transverse knots have support genus zero and also give a condition when non-loose Legendrian knots have non-loose transverse push offs.
