This paper is devoted to a certain class of submanifolds in Poisson geometry, which we call regular. We show that the local Poisson saturation of such a submanifold is an embedded Poisson submanifold, and we prove a normal form theorem for this Poisson submanifold around the regular submanifold. This result recovers the normal form around Poisson transversals, and it extends some normal form/rigidity results around constant rank submanifolds in symplectic geometry. As an application, we prove a uniqueness result concerning coisotropic embeddings of Dirac manifolds in Poisson manifolds. We also show how our results generalize to the setting of regular submanifolds in Dirac geometry.
