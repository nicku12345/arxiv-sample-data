We study the compact monotone Fukaya category of T^*S^n, for n\geq 2, and show that it is split-generated by two classes of objects: the zero-section S^n (equipped with suitable bounding cochains) and a 1-parameter family of monotone Lagrangian tori (S^1\times S^{n-1})_\tau, with monotonicity constants \tau>0 (equipped with rank 1 unitary local systems). As a consequence, any closed orientable spin monotone Lagrangian (possibly equipped with auxiliary data) with non-trivial Floer cohomology is non-displaceable from either S^n or one of the (S^1\times S^{n-1})_\tau. In the case of T^*S^3, the monotone Lagrangians (S^1\times S^2)_\tau can be replaced by a family of monotone tori T^3_\tau.
