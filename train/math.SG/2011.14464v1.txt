We prove, in a geometric way, that the standard contact structure on the real projective space of dimension 2n-1 is not Liouville fillable for n \ge 3 and odd. We also prove that, for all n, semipositive fillings of those contact structures are simply connected. Finally we give yet another proof of the Eliashberg-Floer-McDuff theorem on the diffeomorphism type of the symplectically aspherical fillings of the standard contact structure on the (2n-1)-dimensional sphere.
