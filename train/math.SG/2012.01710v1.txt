We are interested in the classification of left-invariant symplectic structures on Lie groups. Some classifications are known, especially in low dimensions. In this paper we establish a new approach to classify (up to automorphism and scale) left-invariant symplectic structures on Lie groups. The procedure is based on the moduli space of left-invariant nondegenerate 2-forms. Then we apply our procedure for two particular Lie groups of dimension 2n and give classifications of left-invariant symplectic structures on them.
