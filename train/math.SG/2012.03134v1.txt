We show that the minimal symplectic area of Lagrangian submanifolds are universally bounded in symplectically aspherical domains with vanishing symplectic cohomology. If an exact domain admits a k-semi-dilation, then the minimal symplectic area is universally bounded for K(\pi,1)-Lagrangians. As a corollary, we show that Arnold chord conjecture holds for the following four cases: (1) Y admits an exact filling with SH^*(W)=0 (for some ring coefficient); (2) Y admits a symplectically aspherical filling with SH^*(W)=0 and simply connected Legendrians; (3) Y admits an exact filling with a k-semi-dilation and the Legendrian is a K(\pi,1) space; (4) Y is the cosphere bundle S^*Q with \pi_2(Q)\to H_2(Q) nontrivial and the Legendrian has trivial \pi_2. In addition, we obtain the existence of homoclinic orbits in case (1). We also provide many more examples with k-semi-dilations in all dimensions \ge 4.
