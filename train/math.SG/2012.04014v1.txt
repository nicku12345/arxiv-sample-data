Let \mathfrak g be a semisimple Lie algebra, \mathfrak h\subset\mathfrak g a reductive subalgebra such that \mathfrak h^\perp is a complementary \mathfrak h-submodule of \mathfrak g. In 1983, Bogoyavlenski claimed that one obtains a Poisson commutative subalgebra of the symmetric algebra {\mathcal S}(\mathfrak g) by taking the subalgebra {\mathcal Z} generated by the bi-homogeneous components of all H\in{\mathcal S}(\mathfrak g)^{\mathfrak g}. But this is false, and we present a counterexample. We also provide a criterion for the Poisson commutativity of such subalgebras {\mathcal Z}. As a by-product, we prove that {\mathcal Z} is Poisson commutative if \mathfrak h is abelian and describe {\mathcal Z} in the special case when \mathfrak h is a Cartan subalgebra. In this case, {\mathcal Z} appears to be polynomial and has the maximal transcendence degree (\mathrm{dim}\,\mathfrak g+\mathrm{rk}\,\mathfrak g)/2.
