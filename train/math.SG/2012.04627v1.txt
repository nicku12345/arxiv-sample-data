We define a family of symplectic invariants which obstruct exact symplectic embeddings between Liouville manifolds, using the general formalism of linearized contact homology and its L-infinity structure. As our primary application, we investigate embeddings between normal crossing divisor complements in complex projective space, giving a complete characterization in many cases. Our main embedding results are deduced explicitly from pseudoholomorphic curves, without appealing to Hamiltonian or virtual perturbations.
