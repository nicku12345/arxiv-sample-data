We prove that every smoothly immersed 2-torus of \mathbb{R}^4 can be approximated, in the C0-sense, by immersed polyhedral Lagrangian tori. In the case of a smoothly immersed (resp. embedded) Lagrangian torus of \mathbb{R}^4, the surface can be approximated in the C1-sense by immersed (resp. embedded) polyhedral Lagrangian tori. Similar statements are proved for isotropic 2-tori of \mathbb{R}^{2n}.
