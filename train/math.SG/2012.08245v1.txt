We define a unital A_\infty-category whose objects are exact Lagrangian cobordisms in the symplectization of Y=P\times\mathbb{R}, with negative cylindrical ends over Legendrians equipped with augmentations. The morphism spaces are given in terms of Floer complexes Cth_+(\Sigma_0,\Sigma_1) which are versions of the Rabinowitz Floer complex defined by Symplectic Field Theory (SFT) techniques.
