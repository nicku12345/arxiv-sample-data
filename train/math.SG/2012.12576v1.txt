Coisotropic algebras are used to formalize coisotropic reduction in Poisson geometry as well as in deformation quantization and find applications in various other fields as well. In this paper we prove a Serre-Swan Theorem relating the regular projective modules over the coisotropic algebra built out of a manifold M, a submanifold C and an integrable smooth distribution D \subseteq TC with vector bundles over this geometric situation and show an equivalence of categories for the case of a simple distribution.
