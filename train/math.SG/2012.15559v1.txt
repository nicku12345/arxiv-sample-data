Viterbo has conjectured that any Lagrangian in the unit co-disc bundle of a torus which is Hamiltonian isotopic to the zero-section satisfies a uniform bound on its spectral norm; a recent result by Shelukhin showed that this is indeed the case. The modest goal of this note is to explore two natural generalisations of the above geometric setting in which the bound of the spectral norm fails: first, passing to Legendrian isotopies in the contactisation of the unit co-disc bundle (Hamiltonian isotopies lift to Legendrian isotopies) and, second, considering Hamiltonian isotopies but after modifying the co-disc bundle by attaching a critical Weinstein one-handle.
