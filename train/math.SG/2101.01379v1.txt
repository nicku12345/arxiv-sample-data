This paper is a follow-up research of my previous work, arXiv: 2003.06106, giving examples and applications. We apply the Floer-theoretic SYZ mirror construction over the Novikov field to the moment map fibration on a toric manifold and the Gross's special Lagrangian fibration on a toric Calabi-Yau manifold. In the first case, we explain a simple reinterpretation of Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono's work on compact toric manifolds by the family Floer theory. In the second case, we obtain a formal power series identity that involves both Maslov-zero and Maslov-two disk counting, which can particularly retrieve a computation of one-pointed open Gromov-Witten invariants in Chan-Lau-Leung's work.
