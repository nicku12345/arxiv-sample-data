We establish a stability result for the normal forms of arboreal singularities. As our main application of the stability result we give a geometric characterization of arboreal singularities as the closure of the class of smooth germs of Lagrangian submanifolds under the operation of taking iterated transverse Liouville cones. The parametric version of the stability result implies that the space of germs of symplectomorphisms which preserve an arboreal singularity is weakly homotopy equivalent to the space of automorphisms of the corresponding signed rooted tree. Hence the local symplectic topology of an arboreal singularity reduces to combinatorics, even parametrically.
