In this note we study the contact geometry of symplectic divisors. We show the contact structure induced on the boundary of a divisor neighborhood is invariant under toric and interior blow-ups and blow-downs. We also construct an open book decomposition on the boundary of a concave divisor neighborhood and apply it to the study of universally tight contact structures of contact torus bundles.
