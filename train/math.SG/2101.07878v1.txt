We initiate the study of the C^0 symplectic mapping class group, i.e. the group of isotopy classes of symplectic homeomorphisms. We prove that the square of the Dehn-Seidel twist does not belong to the connected component of the identity of the group of symplectic homeomorphisms of some Liouville domain. This generalizes to C^0 settings a celebrated result of Seidel. As a consequence, we obtain the non-triviality of the C^0 symplectic mapping class group in these domains. For that purpose, we develop a method coming from Floer theory and barcodes theory. This builds on the recent developments of C^0-symplectic topology. In particular, we adapt and generalize to our context results by Buhovsky-Humili\`ere-Seyfaddini and Kislev-Shelukhin.
