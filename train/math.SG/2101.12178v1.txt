In this paper we generalise the results of Lekili and Polishchuk arXiv:1705.06023 to establish homological mirror symmetry for Deligne--Mumford stacks whose coarse moduli space is a ring or chain of rational curves joined nodally, and where each irreducible component is allowed to have a generic stabiliser. The mirror is a \Z-graded open Riemann surface. As an application, we prove homological mirror symmetry where the B--model is taken to be an invertible polynomial in two variables with not necessarily maximal grading group. In the maximally graded case we show that the mirror is graded symplectomorphic to the Milnor fibre of the transpose polynomial, and this establishes the Lekili--Ueda conjecture in the case of curves.
