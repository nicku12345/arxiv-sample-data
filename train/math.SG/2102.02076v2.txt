We give infinitely many knots in S^3 that are not smoothly H-slice (that is, bounding a null-homologous disk) in many 4-manifolds but they are topologically H-slice. In particular, we give such knots in punctured elliptic surfaces E(2n). In addition, we give obstructions to codimension-0 embedding of weak symplectic fillings with b_3=0 into closed symplectic 4-manifolds with b_1=0 and b_2^+\equiv 3 \operatorname{mod} 4. We also show that any weakly symplectically fillable 3-manifold bounds a 4-manifold with at least two smooth structures. All of these results follow from our main result that gives an adjunction inequality for embedded surfaces in certain 4-manifolds with contact boundary under a non-vanishing assumption on Bauer-Furuta type invariants.
