In this paper, we treat an open problem related to the number of periodic orbits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on closed symplectic manifolds, so-called generic Conley conjecture. Generic Conley conjecture states that generically Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms have infinitely many simple contractible periodic orbits. We prove generic Conley conjecture for very wide classes of symplectic manifolds.
