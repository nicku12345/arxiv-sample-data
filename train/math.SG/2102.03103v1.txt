For a simply-connected compact semisimple Lie group G and its maximal torus T, we study the A_{\infty}-functor associated to the moment Lagrangian correspondence from the cotangent bundle T^*G to the square G/T^{-} \times G/T. In particular, we compute the leading term of the A_{\infty}-homomorphism from the wrapped Floer cohomology HW^*(T^*_e G, T^*_e G) of the cotangent fiber T_e^*G to the Floer cohomology HF^*(\Delta, \Delta) of the diagonal \Delta in the square G/T^{-} \times G/T by determining the count of certain pseudo-holomorphic quilts. As a consequence, we prove that the Floer cohomologies HW^*(T^*_e G, T^*_e G) and HF^*(\Delta,\Delta) are isomorphic as rings after a localization.
