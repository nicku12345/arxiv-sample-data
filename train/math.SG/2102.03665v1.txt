Suppose Y is an integer homology 3-sphere, Taubes proved that the number of irreducible critical orbits of the perturbed Chern-Simons functional on Y, counted with signs, is equal to the algebraic intersection number of two character varieties associated with Heegaard splittings when the structure group is SU(2). Taubes' result established a relationship between gauge theory and the Casson invariant. This article proves an analogous identification result for SU(n) generalized Casson invariants. As a special case, we show that the SU(3) Casson invariant of Boden-Herald can be equivalently calculated by taking an appropriate intersection number of Lagrangian submanifolds.
