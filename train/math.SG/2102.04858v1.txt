The Chekanov-Eliashberg dg-algebra is a holomorphic curve invariant associated to Legendrian submanifolds of a contact manifold. We extend the definition to Legendrian embeddings of skeleta of Weinstein manifolds. Via Legendrian surgery, the new definition gives direct proofs of wrapped Floer cohomology push-out diagrams. It also leads to a proof of a conjectured isomorphism between partially wrapped Floer cohomology and Chekanov-Eliashberg dg-algebras with coefficients in chains on the based loop space.
