In this paper, we treat an open problem related to the number of periodic orbits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on closed symplectic manifolds. Hofer-Zehnder conjecture states that a Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms has infinitely many periodic orbits if it has "homologically unnecessary periodic orbits"". For example, non-contractible periodic orbits are homologically unnecessary periodic orbits because Floer homology of non-contractible periodic orbits is trivial. We prove Hofer-Zehnder conjecture for non-contractible periodic orbits for very wide classes of symplectic manifolds.
