We construct a sheaf-theoretic analogue of the wrapped Fukaya category in Lagrangian Floer theory, by localizing a category of sheaves microsupported away from some given \Lambda \subset S^*M along continuation maps constructed using the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization.   When \Lambda is a subanalytic singular isotropic, we also construct a comparison map to the category of compact objects in the category of unbounded sheaves microsupported in \Lambda, and show that it is an equivalence. The last statement can be seen as a sheaf theoretical incarnation of the sheaf-Fukaya comparison theorem of Ganatra-Pardon-Shende.
