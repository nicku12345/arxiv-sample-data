In [Hut16], Hutchings uses embedded contact homology to show the following for area-preserving disc diffeomorphisms that are a rotation near the boundary of the disc: If the asymptotic mean action on the boundary is bigger than the Calabi invariant, then the infimum of the mean action of the periodic points is less than or equal to the Calabi invariant. In this note, we extend this to area-preserving disc diffeomorphisms, which are only a rotation on the boundary of the disc. Our strategy is to extend the diffeomorphism to a larger disc with nice properties and apply Hutchings' theorem. As a corollary, we observe that Hutchings' inequality holds for disc diffeomorphisms with a Diophantine rotation number on the boundary. Finally, as an application we show that in almost all cases the Calabi invariant of a smooth pseudo-rotation is equal to its rotation number.
