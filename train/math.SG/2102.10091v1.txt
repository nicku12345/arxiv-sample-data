A singular foliation \mathcal F gives a partition of a manifold M into leaves whose dimension may vary. Associated to a singular foliation are two complexes, that of the diffeological differential forms on the leaf space M / \mathcal F, and that of the basic differential forms on M. We prove the pullback by the quotient map provides an isomorphism of these complexes in the following cases: when \mathcal F is a regular foliation, when points in the leaves of the same dimension assemble into an embedded (more generally, diffeological) submanifold of M, and, as a special case of the latter, when \mathcal F is induced by a linearizable Lie groupoid.
