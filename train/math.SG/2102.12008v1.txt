In a previous paper [3] we have studied flows on polytopes presenting a method to encapsulate its asymptotic dynamics along the heteroclinic network formed by the polytope's edges and vertices. These results apply to the class of polymatrix replicator systems, which contains several important models in Evolutionary Game Theory. Here we establish the Hamiltonian character of the asymptotic dynamics of Hamiltonian polymatrix replicators.
