We define a Lorentzian distance function on the group of contactomorphisms of a closed contact manifold compatible with the relation given by positivity. This distance function is continuous with respect to the Hofer norm on the group of contactomorphisms defined by Shelukhin and finite if and only if the group of contactomorphisms is orderable. To prove this we show that intervals defined by the positivity relation are open with respect to the topology induced by the Hofer norm. For orderable Legendrian isotopy classes we show that the Chekanov-type metric defined Rosen and Zhang is non-degenerate. In this case similar results hold for a Lorentzian distance function on Legendrian isotopy classes. This leads to a natural class of metrics associated to a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold such that its Cauchy hypersurface has a unit co-tangent bundle with orderable isotopy class of the fibres.
