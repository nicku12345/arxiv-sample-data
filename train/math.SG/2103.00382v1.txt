We quantize the problem considered by Bott-Samelson who applied Morse theory to compact symmetric spaces G/K and the associated real flag manifolds \Lambda. The starting point is the construction of a Lagrangian correspondence generalizing Weinstein's moment correspondence, from the cotangent bundle of G/K to the complexification of \Lambda. Then Ma'u-Wehrheim-Woodward's quilted Floer theory gives an A_{\infty} homomorphism \Phi:C_{-*}(\Omega(G/K))\rightarrow CF^*(\Lambda,\Lambda) from the dga of singular chains on the based loop space \Omega(G/K) to the Floer cochain complex of \Lambda. Our main result is reminiscent of the famous conjecture of Peterson about the quantum cohomology of complex flag varieties: H^*(\Phi) becomes an isomorphism after localization. It is a generalization of a result proved by Bae-Leung on the case when G/K is a Lie group.
