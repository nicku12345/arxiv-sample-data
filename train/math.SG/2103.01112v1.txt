We study the transverse K\"ahler holonomy groups on Sasaki manifolds (M,{\oldmathcal S}) and their stability properties under transverse holomorphic deformations of the characteristic foliation by the Reeb vector field. In particular, we prove that when the first Betti number b_1(M) and the basic Hodge number h^{0,2}_B({\oldmathcal S}) vanish, then {\oldmathcal S} is stable under deformations of the transverse K\"ahler flow. In addition we show that an irreducible transverse hyperk\"ahler Sasakian structure is {\oldmathcal S}-unstable, whereas, an irreducible transverse Calabi-Yau Sasakian structure is {\oldmathcal S}-stable when \dim M\geq 7. Finally, we prove that the standard Sasaki join operation (transverse holonomy U(n_1)\times U(n_2)) as well as the fiber join operation preserve {\oldmathcal S}-stability.
