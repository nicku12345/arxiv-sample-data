The main result of the present paper concerns finiteness properties of Floer theoretic invariants on affine log Calabi-Yau varieties X. Namely, we show that:   (a) the degree zero symplectic cohomology SH^0(X) is finitely generated and is a filtered deformation of a certain algebra defined combinatorially in terms of a compactifying divisor \mathbf{D}. (b) For any Lagrangian branes L_0, L_1, the wrapped Floer groups WF^*(L_0,L_1) are finitely generated modules over SH^0(X).   We then describe applications of this result to mirror symmetry, the first of which is an ``automatic generation" criterion for the wrapped Fukaya category \mathcal{W}(X). We also show that, in the case where X is maximally degenerate and admits a ``homological section", \mathcal{W}(X) gives a categorical crepant resolution of the potentially singular variety \operatorname{Spec}(SH^0(X)). This provides a link between the intrinsic mirror symmetry program of Gross and Siebert and the categorical birational geometry program initiated by Bondal-Orlov and Kuznetsov.
