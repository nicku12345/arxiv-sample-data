Let \mathcal F be a co-oriented C^2 foliation on a closed, oriented 3-manifold. We show that T\mathcal F can be perturbed to a contact structure with Reeb flow transverse to \mathcal F if and only if \mathcal F does not support an invariant transverse measure. The resulting Reeb flow has no contractible orbits. This answers a question of Colin and Honda. The main technical tool in our proof is leafwise Brownian motion which we use to construct good transverse measures for \mathcal F; this gives a new perspective on the Eliashberg--Thurston theorem.
