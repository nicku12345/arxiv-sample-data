We establish new examples of augmentations of Legendrian twist knots that cannot be induced by orientable Lagrangian fillings. To do so, we use a version of the Seidel-Ekholm-Dimitroglou Rizell isomorphism with local coefficients to show that any Lagrangian filling point in the augmentation variety of a Legendrian knot must lie in the injective image of an algebraic torus with dimension equal to the first Betti number of the filling. This is a Floer-theoretic version of a result from microlocal sheaf theory. For the augmentations in question, we show that no such algebraic torus can exist.
