In arXiv1312.7267, the first non-trivial example of a Poisson manifold of strong compact type is given. The construction uses the theory of K3 surfaces and results in a Poisson manifold with leaf space S^1. We modify the construction to obtain a new class of examples. Specifically, we obtain for each strongly integral affine 2-torus a Poisson manifold of strong compact type with said torus as leaf space.
