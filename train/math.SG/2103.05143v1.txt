In this paper, we construct a sequence (c_k)_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}} of symplectic capacities based on the Chiu-Tamarkin complex C_{T,\ell}, a \mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}-equivariant invariant coming from the microlocal theory of sheaves. We compute (c_k)_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}} for convex toric domains, which are the same as the Gutt-Hutchings capacities. On the other hand, our method works for the contact embedding problem. We define a sequence of "contact capacities" ([c]_k)_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}} on the prequantized contact manifold \mathbb{R}^{2d}\times S^1, which could derive some embedding obstructions of prequantized convex toric domains.
