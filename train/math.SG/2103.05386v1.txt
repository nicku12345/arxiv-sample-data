The Cox construction presents a toric variety as a quotient of affine space by a torus. The category of coherent sheaves on the corresponding stack thus has an evident description as invariants in a quotient of the category of modules over a polynomial ring. Here we give the mirror to this description, and in particular, a clean new proof of mirror symmetry for smooth toric stacks.
