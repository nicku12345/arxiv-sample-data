On a cotangent bundle T\sp*G of a Lie group G one can describe the standard Liouville form \theta and the symplectic form d \theta in terms of the right Maurer Cartan form and the left moment mapping (of the right action of G on itself), and also in terms of the left Maurer-Cartan form and the right moment mapping, and also the Poisson structure can be written in related quantities. This leads to a wide class of exact symplectic stuctures on T\sp*G and to Poisson structures by replacing the canonical momenta of the right or left actions of G on itself by arbitrary ones, followed by reduction (to G cross a Weyl-chamber, e.g.). This method also works on principal bundles.
