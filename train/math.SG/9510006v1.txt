Let G be a Lie group, with an invariant non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form on its Lie algebra, let \pi be the fundamental group of an orientable (real) surface M with a finite number of punctures, and let \bold C be a family of conjugacy classes in G, one for each puncture. A finite-dimensional construction used earlier to obtain a symplectic structure on the moduli space of flat G-bundles over compact M is extended to the punctured case. It yields a symplectic structure on a certain smooth manifold \Cal M_{\bold C} containing the space \roman{Hom}(\pi,G)_{\bold C} of homomorphisms mapping the generators corresponding to the punctures into the corresponding conjugacy classes. It also yields a Hamiltonian G-action on \Cal M_{\bold C} such that the reduced space equals the moduli space \roman{Rep}(\pi,G)_{\bold C} of representations. For G compact, each such space, obtained by finite-dimensional symplectic reduction, is a {\it stratified symplectic space\/}. For G=U(n) one gets moduli spaces of semistable holomorphic parabolic bundles or spaces closely related to them.
