It is shown that the de Rham complex of a symplectic manifold M satisfying the hard Lefschetz condition is formal. Moreover, it is shown that the differential Gerstenhaber-Batalin-Vilkoviski algebra associated to such a symplectic structure gives rise, along the lines explained in the papers of Barannikov and Kontsevich [alg-geom/9710032] and Manin [math/9801006], to the structure of a Frobenius manifold on the de Rham cohomology of M.
