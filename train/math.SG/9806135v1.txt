We investigate, in some details, symplectic equivalence between several conformal classes of Lorentz metrics on the hyperboloid of one sheet H^{1,1} \cong T \times T - \Delta and affine coadjoint orbits of the group Diff_+(\Delta) of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of \Delta \cong T with its natural projective structure. This will allow for generalizations, namely, to the case of arbitrary projective structures on null infinity.
