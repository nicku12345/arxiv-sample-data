This paper concerns the development and application of the multisymplectic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism for nonlinear partial differential equations.   In this theory, solutions of a PDE are sections of a fiber bundle Y over a base manifold X of dimension n+1, typically taken to be spacetime. Given a connection on Y, a covariant Hamiltonian density {\mathcal H} is then intrinsically defined on the primary constraint manifold P_{\mathcal L}, the image of the multisymplectic version of the Legendre transformation. One views P_{\mathcal L} as a subbundle of J^1(Y)^\star, the affine dual of J^1(Y), the first jet bundle of Y. A canonical multisymplectic (n+2)-form \Omega_{\mathcal H} is then defined, from which we obtain a multisymplectic Hamiltonian system of differential equations that is equivalent to both the original PDE as well as the Euler-Lagrange equations of the corresponding Lagrangian. We show that the n+1 2-forms \omega^{(\mu)} defined by Bridges [1997] are a particular coordinate representation for a single multisymplectic (n+2)-form, and in the presence of symmetries, can be assembled into \Omega_{\mathcal H}. A generalized Hamiltonian Noether theory is then constructed which recovers the vanishing of the divergence of the vector of n+1 distinct momentum mappings defined in Bridges [1997] and, when applied to water waves, recovers Whitham's conservation of wave action. We also show the utility of this theory in the study of periodic pattern formation and wave instability.
