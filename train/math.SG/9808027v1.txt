An index formula is proposed for contact transformations between contact manifolds equipped with CR structures or with fillings by symplectic manifolds. The formula generalizes the Atiyah-Singer formula and gives a conjectured formula for the index of Fourier integral operators, as well as Epstein's relative index for CR structures.
