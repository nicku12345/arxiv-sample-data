A Lie algebroid on a variety X/k is an extension \alpha: g_X \to T_X of the tangent sheaf both as O_X-module and Lie algebra over the base field, with the obvious compatibilities; and given a Lie algebroid one has its associated ring of differential operators D(g_X). Letting g'_X be some Lie sub-algebroid of g_X, a smooth coherent g_X-module M is one in which any (locally defined) coherent O_X-submodule M_0 \subset M generates a g'_X-submodule D(g'_X)M_0 that remains coherent over O_X. Depending on the choice of g'_X one gets in this way interesting classes of g_X-modules, where probably the most important one is that of g_X-modules with regular singularities. The paper is concerned with this notion of smoothness, including results about prolongation of smoothness over codimension \geq 2, preservation of smoothness for inverse and direct images of g_X-modules, and curve tests. In particular we treat g_X-modules with regular singularities, generalizing some of the main theorems for D-modules with new and hopefully transparent proofs.
