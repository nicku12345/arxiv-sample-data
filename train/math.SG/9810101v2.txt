We show that the theory of stable complex G-cobordisms, for a torus G, is embedded into the theory of stable complex G-cobordisms of not necessarily compact manifolds equipped with proper abstract moment maps. Thus the introduction of such non-compact cobordisms in the stable complex G-cobordism theory does not lead to new relations.
