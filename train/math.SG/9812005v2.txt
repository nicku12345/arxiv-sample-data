We study the envelopes of meromorphy of neighborhoods of symplectically immersed two-spheres in complex K\"ahler surfaces using the Gromov's theory of pseudoholomorphic curves.   The construction of a complete family of holomorphic deformations of a non-compact complex curve in a complex manifold, parametrized by a finite codimension analytic subset of a Banach ball, is given.   The existence of this family is used to prove a generalization of Levi's continuity principle, which is applied to describe envelopes of meromorphy.
