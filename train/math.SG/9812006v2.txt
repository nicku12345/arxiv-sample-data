Let M be a symplectic manifold equipped with a Hamiltonian action of a torus T. Let F denote the fixed point set of the T-action and let i:F\hookrightarrow M denote the inclusion. By a theorem of F. Kirwan \cite{K} the induced map i^*:H_T^*(M) \to H_T^*(F) in equivariant cohomology is an injection. We give a simple proof of a formula of Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson \cite{GKM} for the image of the map i^*.
