Given an integral symplectic manifold, we construct a family of "coherent state" maps into complex projective space. The maps are built from sections of the tensor powers of a hermitian line bundle whose curvature is a multiple of the symplectic form. We show that this family is an almost-complex version of the Kodiara embedding. That is, the maps are embeddings which are approximately pseudo-holomorphic.
