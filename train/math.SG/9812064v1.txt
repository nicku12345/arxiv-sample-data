We extend the Nambu bracket to 1-forms. Following the Poisson-Lie case, we define Nambu-Lie groups as Lie groups endowed with a multiplicative Nambu structure. A Lie group G with a Nambu structure P is a Nambu-Lie group iff P=0 at the unit and the Nambu bracket of left (right) invariant forms is left (right) invariant. We define a corresponding notion of a Nambu-Lie algebra. We give several examples of Nambu-Lie groups and algebras.
