The result contained in this paper is an application of a fixed point formula associated with Hamiltonian loop group action. We obtain a G-space which is a geometric dual of the Verlinde's fusion product. Also we obtain a proof of Verlinde formula. The calculation of weights at the fixed point set is based on fundamental properties of root systems of affine Lie algebras.
