We study the rigidity and flexibility of symplectic embeddings of simple shapes. It is first proved that under the condition r_n^2 \le 2 r_1^2 the symplectic ellipsoid E(r_1, ..., r_n) with radii r_1 \le ... \le r_n does not embed in a ball of radius strictly smaller than r_n. We then use symplectic folding to see that this condition is sharp and to construct some nearly optimal embeddings of ellipsoids and polydiscs into balls and cubes. It is finally shown that any connected symplectic manifold of finite volume may be asymptotically filled with skinny ellipsoids or polydiscs.
