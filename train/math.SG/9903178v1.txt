Consider the space R_{\Delta} of rational functions of several variables with poles on a fixed arrangement \Delta of hyperplanes. We obtain a decomposition of R_{\Delta} as a module over the ring of differential operators with constant coefficients. We generalize to the space R_{\Delta} the notions of principal part and of residue, and we describe its relations to Laplace transforms of locally polynomial functions. This explains algebraic aspects of work by L. Jeffreys and F. Kirwan about integrals of equivariant cohomology classes on Hamiltonian manifolds. As another application, we will construct multidimensional versions of Eisenstein series in a subsequent article, and we will obtain another proof of a residue formula of A. Szenes for Witten zeta functions.
