Let M be a compact symplectic manifold on which a compact torus T acts Hamiltonialy with a moment map \mu. Suppose there exists a symplectic involution \theta:M\to M, such that \mu\circ\theta=-\mu. Assuming that 0 is a regular value of \mu, we calculate the trace of the action of \theta on the cohomology of M in terms of the trace of the action of \theta on the symplectic reduction \mu^{-1}(0)/T of M. This result generalizes a theorem of R. Stanley, who considered the case when M was a toric variety.
