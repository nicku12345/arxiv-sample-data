In this paper the Gromov-Witten invariants on a class of noncompact symplectic manifolds are defined by combining Ruan-Tian's method with that of McDuff-Salamon. The main point of the arguments is to introduce a method dealing with the transversality problems in the case of noncompact manifolds. Moreover, the techniques are also used to study the topological rigidity of Hamiltonian loops with compact support on a class of noncompact symplectic manifolds.
