R.C.McLean showed that the moduli space of nearby submanifolds of a smooth, compact, orientable special Lagrangian submanifold L in a Calabi-Yau manifold X is a smooth manifold and its tangent space at L is identified with the space of harmonic one forms on L. In this paper, we will extend this result from Calabi-Yau manifolds to the symplectic manifolds with non-integrable almost complex structure.
