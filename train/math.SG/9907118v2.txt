We show that for a big class of contact manifolds the groups of order \leq n invariants (with values in an arbitrary Abelian group) of Legendrian, of transverse and of framed knots are canonically isomorphic.   On the other hand for an arbitrary cooriented contact structure on S^1\times S^2 with the nonzero Euler class of the contact bundle we construct examples of Legendrian homotopic Legendrian knots K_1 and K_2 such that they realize isotopic framed knots but can be distinguished by finite order invariants of Legendrian knots in S^1\times S^2. We construct similar examples for a big class of contact manifolds M such that M is a total space of a locally trivial S^1-fibration over a nonorientable surface. We show that in some of these examples the complements of K_1 and of K_2 are overtwisted.
