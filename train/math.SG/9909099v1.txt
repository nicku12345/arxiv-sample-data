In this paper, discrete analogues of Euler-Poincar\'{e} and Lie-Poisson reduction theory are developed for systems on finite dimensional Lie groups G with Lagrangians L:TG \to {\mathbb R} that are G-invariant. These discrete equations provide ``reduced'' numerical algorithms which manifestly preserve the symplectic structure. The manifold G \times G is used as an approximation of TG, and a discrete Langragian {\mathbb L}:G \times G \to {\mathbb R} is construced in such a way that the G-invariance property is preserved. Reduction by G results in new ``variational'' principle for the reduced Lagrangian \ell:G \to {\mathbb R}, and provides the discrete Euler-Poincar\'{e} (DEP) equations. Reconstruction of these equations recovers the discrete Euler-Lagrange equations developed in \cite{MPS,WM} which are naturally symplectic-momentum algorithms. Furthermore, the solution of the DEP algorithm immediately leads to a discrete Lie-Poisson (DLP) algorithm. It is shown that when G=\text{SO} (n), the DEP and DLP algorithms for a particular choice of the discrete Lagrangian {\mathbb L} are equivalent to the Moser-Veselov scheme for the generalized rigid body. %As an application, a reduced symplectic integrator for two dimensional %hydrodynamics is constructed using the SU(n) approximation to the volume %preserving diffeomorphism group of {\mathbb T}^2.
