Lichnerowicz-Jacobi cohomology and homology of Jacobi manifolds are reviewed. We present both in a unified approach using the representation of the Lie algebra of functions on itself by means of the hamiltonian vector fields. The use of the associated Lie algebroid allows to prove that the Lichnerowicz-Jacobi cohomology and homology are invariant under conformal changes of the Jacobi structure and to stablish the duality between Lichnerowicz-Jacobi cohomology and homology when the modular class vanishes. We also compute the Lichnerowicz-Jacobi cohomology and homology for a large variety of examples.
