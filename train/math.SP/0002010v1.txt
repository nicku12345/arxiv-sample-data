We consider the eigenvalue pair correlation problem for certain integrable quantum maps on the 2-sphere. The classical maps are time one maps of Hamiltonian flows of perfect Morse functions. The quantizations are unitary operators on spaces of homogeneous holomorphic polynomials of degree N in two complex variables. There are N eigenphases on the unit circle and the pair correlation problem is to determine the distribution of spacings between the eigenphases on the length scale of the mean level spacing. The Berry-Tabor conjecture says that for generic integrable systems, the spacings distribution should tend to the Poisson (uniform) limit as N tends to infinity. In this paper and in its addendum we prove a somewhat weak form of this conjecture: We define a large class of two parameter families of integrable Hamiltonians, and prove that for almost all elements of each family the limit pair correlation function is Poisson. In this paper, we take the limit along a slightly sparse subsequence of N's; in the addendum we take Cesaro means along the full seuqence.
