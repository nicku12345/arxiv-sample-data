In this addendum we strengthen the results of math-ph/0002010 in the case of polynomial phases. We prove that Cesaro means of the pair correlation functions of certain integrable quantum maps on the 2-sphere at level N tend almost always to the Poisson (uniform limit). The quantum maps are exponentials of Hamiltonians which have the form a p(I) + b I, where I is the action, where p is a polynomial and where a,b are two real numbers. We prove that for any such family and for almost all a,b, the pair correlation tends to Poisson on average in N. The results involve Weyl estimates on exponential sums and new metric results on continued fractions. They were motivated by a comparison of the results of math-ph/0002010 with some independent results on pair correlation of fractional parts of polynomials by Rudnick-Sarnak.
