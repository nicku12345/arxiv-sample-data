The standard eigenfunctions \phi_{\lambda} = e^{i < \lambda, x >} on flat tori \R^n / L have L^{\infty}-norms bounded independently of the eigenvalue. In the case of irrational flat tori, it follows that L^2-normalized eigenfunctions have uniformly bounded L^{\infty}-norms. Similar bases exist on other flat manifolds. Does this property characterize flat manifolds? We give an affirmative answer for compact Riemannian manifolds with completely integrable geodesic flows.
