The main aim of the paper is to present a general version of the Fourier Tauberian theorem for monotone functions. This result, together with Berezin's inequality, allows us to obtain a refined version the Li-Yau estimate for the counting function of the Dirichlet Laplacian which implies the Li-Yau estimate itself and, at the same time, the asymptotic results obtained by the variational method.
