Let g(z,x) denote the diagonal Green's matrix of a self-adjoint m\times m matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operator H= -\f{d^2}{dx^2}I_m +Q(x) in L^2 (\bbR)^{m}, m\in\bbN. One of the principal results proven in this paper states that for a fixed x_0\in\bbR and all z\in\bbC_+, g(z,x_0) and g^\prime (z,x_0) uniquely determine the matrix-valued m\times m potential Q(x) for a.e.~x\in\bbR. We also prove the following local version of this result. Let g_j(z,x), j=1,2 be the diagonal Green's matrices of the self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators H_j=-\f{d^2}{dx^2}I_m +Q_j(x) in L^2 (\bbR)^{m}. Suppose that for fixed a>0 and x_0\in\bbR, \|g_1(z,x_0)-g_2(z,x_0)\|_{\bbC^{m\times m}}+ \|g_1^\prime (z,x_0)-g_2^\prime (z,x_0)\|_{\bbC^{m\times m}} \underset{|z|\to\infty}{=}O\big(e^{-2\Im(z^{1/2})a}\big) for z inside a cone along the imaginary axis with vertex zero and opening angle less than \pi/2, excluding the real axis. Then Q_1(x)=Q_2(x) for a.e.~x\in [x_0-a,x_0+a]. Analogous results are proved for matrix-valued Jacobi and Dirac-type operators.
