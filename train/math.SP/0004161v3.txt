The operator e^{-tA} and its trace are investigated in the case when A is a non-self-adjoint elliptic differential operator on a manifold with conical singularities. Under a certain spectral condition (parameter-ellipticity) we obtain a full asymptotic expansion in t of the heat trace as t\to 0^+. As in the smooth compact case, the problem is reduced to the investigation of the resolvent (A-\lambda)^{-1}. The main step will consist in approximating this operator family by a parametrix to A-\lambda using a suitable parameter-dependent calculus.
