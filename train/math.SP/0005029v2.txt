The formalism of exact 1D quantization is reviewed in detail and applied to the spectral study of three concrete Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians [-\d^2/\d q^2 + V(q)]^\pm on the half-line \{q>0\}, with a Dirichlet (-) or Neumann (+) condition at q=0. Emphasis is put on the analytical investigation of the spectral determinants and spectral zeta functions with respect to singular perturbation parameters. We first discuss the homogeneous potential V(q)=q^N as N \to +\inftyvs its (solvable) N=\infty limit (an infinite square well): useful distinctions are established between regular and singular behaviours of spectral quantities; various identities among the square-well spectral functions are unraveled as limits of finite-N properties. The second model is the quartic anharmonic oscillator: its zero-energy spectral determinants \det(-\d^2/\d q^2 + q^4 + v q^2)^\pm are explicitly analyzed in detail, revealing many special values, algebraic identities between Taylor coefficients, and functional equations of a quartic type coupled to asymptotic v \to +\infty properties of Airy type. The third study addresses the potentials V(q)=q^N+v q^{N/2-1} of even degree: their zero-energy spectral determinants prove computable in closed form, and the generalized eigenvalue problems with v as spectral variable admit exact quantization formulae which are perfect extensions of the harmonic oscillator case (corresponding to N=2); these results probably reflect the presence of supersymmetric potentials in the family above.
