We eliminate by KAM methods the time dependence in a class of linear differential equations in \ell^2 subject to an unbounded, quasi-periodic forcing. This entails the pure-point nature of the Floquet spectrum of the operator  H_0+\epsilon P(\om t) for \epsilon small. Here H_0 is the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator p^2+V, V(x)\sim |x|^{\alpha}, \alpha >2 for |x|\to\infty, the time quasi--periodic perturbation P may grow as \displaystyle |x|^{\beta}, \beta <(\alpha-2)/{2}, and the frequency vector \omega is non resonant. The proof extends to infinite dimensional spaces the result valid for quasiperiodically forced linear differential equations and is based on Kuksin's estimate of solutions of homological equations with non constant coefficients.
