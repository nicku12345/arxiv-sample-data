We develop the scattering theory of general conformally compact metrics. For low frequencies, the domain of the scattering matrix is shown to be frequency dependent. In particular, generalized eigenfunctions exhibit L^2 decay in directions where the asymptotic curvature is sufficiently negative. The scattering matrix is shown to be a pseudodifferential operator. For generic frequency in this part of the continuous spectrum, we give an explicit construction of the resolvent kernel.
