In this article we continue our analysis of Schroedinger operators with a random potential using scattering theory. In particular the theory of Krein's spectral shift function leads to an alternative construction of the density of states in arbitrary dimensions. For arbitrary dimension we show existence of the spectral shift density, which is defined as the bulk limit of the spectral shift function per unit interaction volume. This density equals the difference of the density of states for the free and the interaction theory. This extends the results previously obtained by the authors in one dimension. Also we consider the case where the interaction is concentrated near a hyperplane.
