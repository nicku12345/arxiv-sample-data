Let A be a linear bounded operator in a Hilbert space H, N(A) and R(A) its null-space and range, and A^* its adjoint. The operator A is called Fredholm iff dim N(A)= dim N(A^*):=n<\infty and R(A) and R(A^*) are closed subspaces of H.   A simple and short proof is given of the following known result: A is Fredholm iff A=B+F, where B is an isomorphism and F is a finite-rank operator. The proof consists in reduction to a finite-dimensional linear algebraic system which is equivalent to the equation Au=f in the case of Fredholm operators.
