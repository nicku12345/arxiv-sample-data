Recently, Borodin and Okounkov established a remarkable identity for Toeplitz determinants. Two other proofs of this identity were subsequently found by Basor and Widom, who also extended the formula to the block case. We here give one more proof, also for the block case. This proof is based on a formula for the inverse of a finite block Toeplitz matrix obtained in the late seventies by Silbermann and the author.
