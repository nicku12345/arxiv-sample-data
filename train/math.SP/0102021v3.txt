In this paper, we study an L2 version of the semiclassical approximation of magnetic Schroedinger operators with invariant Morse type potentials on covering spaces of compact manifolds. In particular, we are able to establish the existence of an arbitrary large number of gaps in the spectrum of these operators, in the semiclassical limit as the coupling constant goes to zero.
