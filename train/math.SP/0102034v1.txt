Poeschl-Teller trigonometric potential well is PT symmetrically regularized at its "impenetrable" end-point barriers. This gives the four different solvable generalizations of the model and enables us to clarify some paradoxes encountered, in the SUSY context, in the classically forbidden coupling regime.
