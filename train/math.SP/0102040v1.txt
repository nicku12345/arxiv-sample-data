We explicitly determine the high-energy asymptotics for Weyl-Titchmarsh matrices associated with general Dirac-type operators on half-lines and on \bbR. We also prove new local uniqueness results for Dirac-type operators in terms of exponentially small differences of Weyl-Titchmarsh matrices. As concrete applications of the asymptotic high-energy expansion we derive a trace formula for Dirac operators and use it to prove a Borg-type theorem.
