Using simple commutator relations, we obtain several trace identities involving eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an abstract self-adjoint operator acting in a Hilbert space. Applications involve abstract universal estimates for the eigenvalue gaps. As particular examples, we present simple proofs of the classical universal estimates for eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian (Payne-Polya-Weinberger, Hile-Protter, etc.), as well as of some known and new results for other differential operators and systems. We also suggest an extension of the methods to the case of non-self-adjoint operators.
