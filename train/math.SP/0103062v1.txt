For a symplectic manifold with quantizing line bundle, a choice of almost complex structure determines a Laplacian acting on tensor powers of the bundle. For high tensor powers Guillemin-Uribe showed that there is a well-defined cluster of low-lying eigenvalues, whose distribution is described by a spectral density function. We give an explicit computation of the spectral density function, by constructing certain quasimodes on the associated principle bundle.
