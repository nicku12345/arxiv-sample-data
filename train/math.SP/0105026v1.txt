This paper presents numerical evidence that for quantum systems with chaotic classical dynamics, the number of scattering resonances near an energy E scales like \hbar^{-\frac{D(K_E)+1}{2}} as \hbar\to{0}. Here, K_E denotes the subset of the classical energy surface \{H=E\} which stays bounded for all time under the flow generated by the Hamiltonian H and D(K_E) denotes its fractal dimension. Since the number of bound states in a quantum system with n degrees of freedom scales like \hbar^{-n}, this suggests that the quantity \frac{D(K_E)+1}{2} represents the effective number of degrees of freedom in scattering problems.
