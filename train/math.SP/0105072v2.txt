We present a concise explicit expression for the heat trace coefficients of spheres. Our formulas yield certain combinatorial identities which are proved following ideas of D. Zeilberger. In particular, these identities allow to recover in a surprising way some known formulas for the heat trace asymptotics. Our approach is based on a method for computation of heat invariants developed in math.DG/9905073.
