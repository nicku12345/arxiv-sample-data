We study discrete Schroedinger operators (H_{\alpha,\theta}\psi)(n)= \psi(n-1)+\psi(n+1)+f(\alpha n+\theta)\psi(n) on l^2(Z), where f(x) is a real analytic periodic function of period 1. We prove a general theorem relating the measure of the spectrum of H_{\alpha,\theta} to the measures of the spectra of its canonical rational approximants under the condition that the Lyapunov exponents of H_{\alpha,\theta} are positive. For the almost Mathieu operator (f(x)=2\lambda\cos 2\pi x) it follows that the measure of the spectrum is equal to 4|1-|\lambda|| for all real \theta, \lambda\ne\pm 1, and all irrational \alpha.
