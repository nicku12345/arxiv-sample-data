We describe the spectrum of a non-self-adjoint elliptic system on a finite interval. Under certain conditions we find that the eigenvalues form a discrete set and converge asymptotically at infinity to one of several straight lines. The eigenfunctions need not generate a basis of the relevant Hilbert space, and the larger eigenvalues are extremely sensitive to small perturbations of the operator. We show that the leading term in the spectral asymptotics is closely related to a certain convex polygon, and that the spectrum does not determine the operator up to similarity. Two elliptic systems which only differ in their boundary conditions may have entirely different spectral asymptotics. While our study makes no claim to generality, the results obtained will have to be incorporated into any future general theory.
