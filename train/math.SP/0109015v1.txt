We define the two dimensional Pauli operator and identify its core for magnetic fields that are regular Borel measures. The magnetic field is generated by a scalar potential hence we bypass the usual \bA\in L^2_{loc} condition on the vector potential which does not allow to consider such singular fields. We extend the Aharonov-Casher theorem for magnetic fields that are measures with finite total variation and we present a counterexample in case of infinite total variation. One of the key technical tools is a weighted L^2 estimate on a singular integral operator.
