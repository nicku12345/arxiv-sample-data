Let K be a proper cone in \IR^n, let A be an n\times n real matrix that satisfies AK\subseteq K, let b be a given vector of K, and let \lambda be a given positive real number. The following two linear equations are considered in this paper: (i)(\lambda I_n-A)x=b, x\in K, and (ii)(A-\lambda I_n)x=b, x\in K. We obtain several equivalent conditions for the solvability of the first equation. For the second equation we give an equivalent condition for its solvability in case when \lambda>\rho_b (A), and we also find a necessary condition when \lambda=\rho_b (A) and also when \lambda < \rho_b(A), sufficiently close to \rho_b(A), where \rho_b (A) denotes the local spectral radius of A at b. With \lambda fixed, we also consider the questions of when the set (A-\lambda I_n)K \bigcap K equals \{0\} or K, and what the face of K generated by the set is. Then we derive some new results about local spectral radii and Collatz-Wielandt sets (or numbers) associated with a cone-preserving map, and extend a known characterization of M-matrices among Z-matrices in terms of alternating sequences.
