We look at invariance of a.e. boundary condition spectral behavior under perturbations, W, of half-line, continuum or discrete Schr\"odinger operators. We extend the results of del Rio, Simon, Stolz from compactly supported W's to suitable short-range W. We also discuss invariance of the local Hausdorff dimension of spectral measures under such perturbations.
