We study the length, weak length and complex length spectrum of closed geodesics of a compact flat Riemannian manifold, comparing length-isospectrality with isospectrality of the Laplacian acting on p-forms. Using integral roots of the Krawtchouk polynomials, we give many pairs of p-isospectral flat manifolds having different lengths of closed geodesics and in some cases, different injectivity radius and different first eigenvalue. We prove a Poisson summation formula relating the p-eigenvalue spectrum with the lengths of closed geodesics. As a consequence we show that the spectrum determines the lengths of closed geodesics and, by an example, that it does not determine the complex lengths. Furthermore we show that orientability is an audible property for flat manifolds. We give a variety of examples, for instance, a pair of isospectral (resp. Sunada isospectral) manifolds with different length spectra and a pair with the same complex length spectra and not p-isospectral for any p, or else p-isospectral for only one value of p different from 0.
