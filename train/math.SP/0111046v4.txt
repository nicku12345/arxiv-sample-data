We discuss the decomposition of the zeta-determinant of the square of the Dirac operator into contributions coming from the different parts of the manifold. The easy case was worked in the previous paper of authors. Due to the assumptions made on the operators in the previous paper, we were able to avoid the presence of the small eigenvalues which provide the large time contibution to the determinant. In the present work we analyze the general case. We offer a detailed analysis of the contribution made by the small eigenvalues.
