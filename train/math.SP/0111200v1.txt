We construct examples of potentials V(x) satisfying |V(x)| \leq \frac{h(x)}{1+x}, where the function h(x) is growing arbitrarily slowly, such that the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator has imbedded singular continuous spectrum. This solves one of the fifteen "twenty-first century" problems for Schr\"odinger operators posed by Barry Simon. The construction also provides the first example of a Schr\"odinger operator for which M\"oller wave operators exist but are not asymptotically complete due to the presence of singular continuous spectrum.
