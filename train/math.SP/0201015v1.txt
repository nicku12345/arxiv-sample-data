Eigenvalue behavior for the equation -\lambda y"=Vu on the edges of a graph G of final total length, with a non-negative weight function V and under the Kirchhoff matching conditions at the vertices and zero boundary condition at at least one point of G, is studied. It is shown that the eigenvalues satisfy an inequality which involves the length |G| and the total mass corresponding to V but otherwise does not depend on the graph. Applications and generalizations of this result are also discussed.
