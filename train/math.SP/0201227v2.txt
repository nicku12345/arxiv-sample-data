Let H be the discrete Schr\"odinger operator Hu(n):=u(n-1)+u(n+1)+v(n)u(n), u(0)=0 acting on l^2({\bf Z}^+) where the potential v is real-valued and v(n)\to 0 as n\to \infty. Let P be the orthogonal projection onto a closed linear subspace L \subset l^2({\bf Z}^+). In a recent paper E.B. Davies defines the second order spectrum {\rm Spec}_2(H,L) of H relative to L as the set of z \in {\bf C} such that the restriction to L of the operator P(H-z)^2P is not invertible within the space L. The purpose of this article is to investigate properties of {\rm Spec}_2(H,L) when L is large but finite dimensional. We explore in particular the connection between this set and the spectrum of H. Our main result provides sharp bounds in terms of the potential v for the asymptotic behaviour of {\rm Spec}_2(H,L) as L increases towards l^2({\bf Z}^+).
