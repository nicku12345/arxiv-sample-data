Suppose that M is a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary and u is an L^2-normalized Dirichlet eigenfunction with eigenvalue \lambda. Let \psi be its normal derivative at the boundary. Scaling considerations lead one to expect that the L^2 norm of \psi will grow as \lambda^{1/2} as \lambda \to \infty. We prove an upper bound of the form \|\psi \|_2^2 \leq C\lambda for any Riemannian manifold, and a lower bound c \lambda \leq \|\psi \|_2^2 provided that M has no trapped geodesics (see the main Theorem for a precise statement). Here c and C are positive constants that depend on M, but not on \lambda. The proof of the upper bound is via a Rellich-type estimate and is rather simple, while the lower bound is proved via a positive commutator estimate.
