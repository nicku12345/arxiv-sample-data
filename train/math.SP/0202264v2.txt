Let X be a compact Riemannian manifold with conic singularities, i.e. a Riemannian manifold whose metric has a conic degeneracy at the boundary. Let \Delta be the Friedrichs extension of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on X. There are two natural ways to define geodesics passing through the boundary: as ``diffractive'' geodesics which may emanate from \partial X in any direction, or as ``geometric'' geodesics which must enter and leave \partial X at points which are connected by a geodesic of length \pi in \partial X. Let \DIFF=\{0\} \cup \{\pm lengths of closed diffractive geodesics\} and \GEOM=\{0\} \cup \{\pm lengths of closed geometric geodesics\}. We show that  \Tr \cos t \sqrt\Delta \in C^{-n-0}(\RR) \cap C^{-1-0}(\RR\backslash \GEOM) \cap C^\infty(\RR\backslash \DIFF). This generalizes a classical result of Chazarain and Duistermaat-Guillemin on boundaryless manifolds, which in turn follows from Poisson summation in the case X=S^1.
