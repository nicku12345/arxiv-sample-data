Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold and D\subset M a smoothly bounded domain with compact closure. We use Brownian motion and the classic results on the Stieltjes moment problem to study the relationship between the Dirichlet spectrum of D and the heat content asymptotics of D. Central to our investigation is a sequence of invariants associated to D defined using exit time moments. We prove that our invariants determine that part of the spectrum corresponding to eigenspaces which are not orthogonal to constant functions, that our invariants determine the heat content asymptotics associated to the manifold, and that when the manifold is a generic domain in Euclidean space, the invariants determine the Dirichlet spectrum.
