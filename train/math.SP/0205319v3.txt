We obtain bounds for the spectrum and for the total width of the spectral gaps for Jacobi matrices on \ell^2(\Z) of the form (H\psi)_n= a_{n-1}\psi_{n-1}+b_n\psi_n+a_n\psi_{n+1}, where a_n=a_{n+q} and b_n=b_{n+q} are periodic sequences of real numbers. The results are based on a study of the quasimomentum k(z) corresponding to H. We consider k(z) as a conformal mapping in the complex plane. We obtain the trace identities which connect integrals of the Lyapunov exponent over the gaps with the normalised traces of powers of H.
