We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a Banach space operator with the single valued extension property (SVEP) to satisfy Weyl's theorem and a-Weyl's theorem. We show that if T or T^{\ast} has SVEP and T is transaloid, then Weyl's theorem holds for f(T) for every f\in H(\sigma (T)). When T^{\ast} has SVEP, T is transaloid and T is a-isoloid, then a-Weyl's theorem holds for f(T) for every f\in H(\sigma (T)). We also prove that if T or T^{\ast} has SVEP, then the spectral mapping theorem holds for the Weyl spectrum and for the essential approximate point spectrum.
