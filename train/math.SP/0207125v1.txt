We introduce a new concept of unbounded solutions to the operator Riccati equation A_1 X - X A_0 - X V X + V^\ast = 0 and give a complete description of its solutions associated with the spectral graph subspaces of the block operator matrix \mathbf{B} = \begin{pmatrix} A_0 & V V^\ast & A_1 \end{pmatrix}. We also provide a new characterization of the set of all contractive solutions under the assumption that the Riccati equation has a contractive solution associated with a spectral subspace of the operator \mathbf{B}. In this case we establish a criterion for the uniqueness of contractive solutions.
