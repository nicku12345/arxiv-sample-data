The recent Letter by Bender, Berry, and Mandilara (2002, BBM) presents some interesting symmetry arguments which enable one to transform non-hermitian, PT invariant, (complex) polynomial potential hamiltonians, into secular equation representations with real coefficients. This achievement is claimed to ``demistify'' why these systems can admit real and/or complex eigenenergies. Two approximations underly their arguments, and weaken the implied significance of their work.
