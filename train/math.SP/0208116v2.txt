In this paper we continue our program of extending the methods of geometric scattering theory to encompass the analysis of the Laplacian on symmetric spaces of rank greater than one and their geometric perturbations. In our previous work we described the resolvent, and specifically the asymptotic behavior of the Green's function, on SL(3)/SO(3) using methods from three-particle scattering. Here we extend the technique of complex scaling to symmetric spaces to show that the resolvent continues analytically across the spectrum.
