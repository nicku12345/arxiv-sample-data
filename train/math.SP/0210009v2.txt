We introduce new coherent states and use them to prove semi-classical estimates for Schr\"odinger operators with regular potentials. This can be further applied to the Thomas-Fermi potential yielding a new proof of the Scott correction for molecules. This is the short version of a paper by the authors archived at math-ph/0208044.
