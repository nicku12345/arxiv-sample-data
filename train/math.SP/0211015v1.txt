Let H be a one-dimensional discrete Schr\"odinger operator. We prove that if \sigma_{\ess} (H)\subset [-2,2], then H-H_0 is compact and \sigma_{\ess}(H)=[-2,2]. We also prove that if H_0 + \frac14 V^2 has at least one bound state, then the same is true for H_0 +V. Further, if H_0 + \frac14 V^2 has infinitely many bound states, then so does H_0 +V. Consequences include the fact that for decaying potential V with \liminf_{|n|\to\infty} |nV(n)| > 1, H_0 +V has infinitely many bound states; the signs of V are irrelevant. Higher-dimensional analogues are also discussed.
