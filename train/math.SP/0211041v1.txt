We give a new upper bound on the Selberg zeta function for a convex co-compact Schottky group acting on  {\mathbb H}^{n+1}: in strips parallel to the imaginary axis the zeta function is bounded by  \exp (C |s|^\delta)  where  \delta  is the dimension of the limit set of the group. This bound is more precise than the optimal global bound  \exp (C |s|^{n+1}) , and it gives new bounds on the number of resonances (scattering poles) of  \Gamma \backslash {\mathbb H}^{n+1} . The proof of this result is based on the application of holomorphic  L^2-techniques to the study of the determinants of the Ruelle transfer operators and on the quasi-self-similarity of limit sets. We also study this problem numerically and provide evidence that the bound may be optimal. Our motivation comes from molecular dynamics and we consider  \Gamma \backslash {\mathbb H}^{n+1}  as the simplest model of quantum chaotic scattering. The proof of this result is based on the application of holomorphic L^2-techniques to the study of the determinants of the Ruelle transfer operators and on the quasi-self-similarity of limit sets.
