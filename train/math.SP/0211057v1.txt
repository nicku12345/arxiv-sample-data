We consider Schr\"odinger operators in \ell^2(\Z) whose potentials are obtained by randomly concatenating words from an underlying set \mathcal{W} according to some probability measure \nu on \mathcal{W}. Our assumptions allow us to consider models with local correlations, such as the random dimer model or, more generally, random polymer models. We prove spectral localization and, away from a finite set of exceptional energies, dynamical localization for such models. These results are obtained by employing scattering theoretic methods together with Furstenberg's theorem to verify the necessary input to perform a multiscale analysis.
