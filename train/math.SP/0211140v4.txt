Suppose that Omega is a bounded, piecewise smooth Euclidean domain. We prove that the boundary values (Cauchy data) of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on Omega with various boundary conditions are quantum ergodic if the classical billiard map (on the ball bundle of the boundary of Omega) is ergodic.   Our proof is based on the classical observation that the boundary value of an interior eigenfunction is an eigenfunction of an operator F_h on the boundary of Omega, where h^{-2} is equal to the eigenvalue. In the case of the Neumann boundary condition, F_h is the boundary integral operator induced by the double layer potential. We show that F_h is a semiclassical Fourier integral operator quantizing the billiard map plus a `small' remainder. We then use the quantum dyanmics defined by F_h at the boundary to prove the result, much as the quantum dynamics generated by the wave group were exploited in the work of Zelditch-Zworski (1996). Novelties include the facts that F_h is not unitary and (consequently) the boundary values are equidistributed by measures which are not invariant under the billiard map and which depend on the boundary conditions.
