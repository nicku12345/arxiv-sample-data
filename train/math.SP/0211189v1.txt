It is well known that (i) for every irrational number \alpha the Kronecker sequence m\alpha (m=1,...,M) is equidistributed modulo one in the limit M\to\infty, and (ii) closed horocycles of length \ell become equidistributed in the unit tangent bundle T_1 M of a hyperbolic surface M of finite area, as \ell\to\infty. In the present paper both equidistribution problems are studied simultaneously: we prove that for any constant \nu > 0 the Kronecker sequence embedded in T_1 M along a long closed horocycle becomes equidistributed in T_1 M for almost all \alpha, provided that \ell = M^{\nu} \to \infty. This equidistribution result holds in fact under explicit diophantine conditions on \alpha (e.g., for \alpha=\sqrt 2) provided that \nu<1, or \nu<2 with additional assumptions on the Fourier coefficients of certain automorphic forms. Finally, we show that for \nu=2, our equidistribution theorem implies a recent result of Rudnick and Sarnak on the uniformity of the pair correlation density of the sequence n^2 \alpha modulo one.
