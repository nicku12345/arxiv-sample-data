Motivated by the problems of analytic hypoellipticity, we show that a special family of compact non self-adjoint operators has a non-zero eigenvalue. We recover old results by Christ,Hanges, Himonas, Pham-The-Lai and Robert proved by using ordinary differential equations. We show our method applies to higher dimensional cases, giving in particular a new class of hypoelliptic but not analytic hypoelliptic operators.
