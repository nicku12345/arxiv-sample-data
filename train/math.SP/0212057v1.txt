We consider a random family of Schr\"odinger operators on a cover X of a compact Riemannian manifold M = X/\Gamma. We present several results on their spectral theory, in particular almost sure constancy of the spectral components and existence and non-randomness of an integrated density of states. We also sketch a groupoid based general framework which allows to treat basic features of random operators in different contexts in a unified way. Further topics of research are also discussed.
