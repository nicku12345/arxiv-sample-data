We prove an adiabatic decomposition formula of the zeta-determinant of the Laplace type operator with respect to Dirichlet boundary condition. We allow the non-invertible tangential operator. As a result, our adiabatic decomposition formula involves the scattering matrix over the manifold with cylindrical end. We also describe the adiabatic limit of the zeta-determinant of the Dirichlet to Neumann operator, which plays the essential role of Burghelea-Friedlander-Kappeler's Meyer-Vietoris type formula of the zeta determinant.
