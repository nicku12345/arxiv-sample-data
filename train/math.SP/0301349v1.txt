Consider M, a bounded domain in {\mathbb R}^d, which is a Riemanian manifold with piecewise smooth boundary and suppose that the billiard associated to the geodesic flow reflecting on the boundary acording to the laws of geometric optics is ergodic. We prove that the boundary value of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator with reasonable boundary conditions are asymptotically equidistributed in the boundary, extending previous results by G\'erard, Leichtnam \cite{GeLe93-1} and Hassel, Zelditch \cite{HaZe02} obtained under the additional assumption of the convexity of M.
