Let \mathbf{A} be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a separable Hilbert space \mathfrak{H} and \mathfrak{H}_0\subset\mathfrak{H} a closed invariant subspace of \mathbf{A}. Assuming that \sup\spec(A_0)\leq \inf\spec(A_1), where A_0 and A_1 are restrictions of \mathbf{A} onto the subspaces \mathfrak{H}_0 and \mathfrak{H}_1=\mathfrak{H}_0^\perp, respectively, we study the variation of the invariant subspace \mathfrak{H}_0 under bounded self-adjoint perturbations \mathbf{V} that are off-diagonal with respect to the decomposition \mathfrak{H} = \mathfrak{H}_0\oplus\mathfrak{H}_1. We obtain sharp two-sided estimates on the norm of the difference of the orthogonal projections onto invariant subspaces of the operators \mathbf{A} and \mathbf{B}=\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{V}. These results extend the celebrated Davis-Kahan \tan 2\Theta Theorem. On this basis we also prove new existence and uniqueness theorems for contractive solutions to the operator Riccati equation, thus, extending recent results of Adamyan, Langer, and Tretter.
