We prove lower bounds on ||T_t||, where T_t is a one-parameter semigroup, starting from information on the resolvent norms, i.e. the pseudospectra. We provide a physically important example in which the growth of the semigroup norm cannot be derived from spectral information. The generator is a self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operator, but the semigroup growth is measured using the L^1 norm rather than the L^2 norm. Numerical confirmation of the results is provided.
