We developed a non-parametric method of Information Decomposition (ID) of a content of any symbolical sequence. The method is based on the calculation of Shannon mutual information between analyzed and artificial symbolical sequences, and allows the revealing of latent periodicity in any symbolical sequence. We show the stability of the ID method in the case of a large number of random letter changes in an analyzed symbolic sequence. We demonstrate the possibilities of the method, analyzing both poems, and DNA and protein sequences. In DNA and protein sequences we show the existence of many DNA and amino acid sequences with different types and lengths of latent periodicity. The possible origin of latent periodicity for different symbolical sequences is discussed.
