We describe numerical calculations which examine the Phillips-Sarnak conjecture concerning the disappearance of cusp forms on a noncompact finite volume Riemann surface S under deformation of the surface. Our calculations indicate that if the Teichmuller space of S is not trivial then each cusp form has a set of deformations under which either the cusp form remains a cusp form, or else it dissolves into a resonance whose constant term is uniformly a factor of 10^{8} smaller than a typical Fourier coefficient of the form. We give explicit examples of those deformations in several cases.
