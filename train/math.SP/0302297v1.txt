This is the first in a series of works devoted to small non-selfadjoint perturbations of selfadjoint h-pseudodifferential operators in dimension 2. In the present work we treat the case when the classical flow of the unperturbed part is periodic and the strength \epsilon of the perturbation is \gg h (or sometimes only \gg h^2) and bounded from above by h^{\delta} for some \delta>0. We get a complete asymptotic description of all eigenvalues in certain rectangles [-1/C, 1/C]+ i\epsilon [F_0-1/C,F_0+1/C].
