We consider Sch\"odinger operators on the half-line, both discrete and continuous, and show that the absence of bound states implies the absence of embedded singular spectrum. More precisely, in the discrete case we prove that if \Delta + V has no spectrum outside of the interval [-2,2], then it has purely absolutely continuous spectrum. In the continuum case we show that if both -\Delta + V and -\Delta - V have no spectrum outside [0,\infty), then both operators are purely absolutely continuous. These results extend to operators with finitely many bound states.
