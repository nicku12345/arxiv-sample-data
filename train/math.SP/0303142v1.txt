In this paper we study the solitary waves for the coupled Schr\"odinger - Maxwell equations in three-dimensional space. We prove the existence of a sequence of radial solitary waves for these equations with a fixed L^2 norm. We study the asymptotic behavior and the smoothness of these solutions. We show also the fact that the eigenvalues are negative and the first one is isolated.
