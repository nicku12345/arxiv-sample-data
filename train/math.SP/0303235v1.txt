We study evolution equations with non-self-adjoint generators, for example the convection-diffusion equation. Spectral expansions are not a reliable method of solving such equations, because they are so ill-conditioned. We introduce a new method using pseusospectra to produce an approximated spectral expansion, and explain its theoretical status. We also give some simple numerical examples to show that it is much better conditioned.
