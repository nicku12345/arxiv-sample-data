We give a lower bound for the bottom of the L^2 differential form spectrum on hyperbolic manifolds, generalizing thus a well-known result due to Sullivan and Corlette in the function case. Our method is based on the study of the resolvent associated with the Hodge-de Rham Laplacian and leads to applications for the (co)homology and topology of certain classes of hyperbolic manifolds.
