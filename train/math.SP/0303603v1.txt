Simple analytically solvable models are proposed exhibiting 1/f spectrum in wide range of frequency. The signals of the models consist of pulses (point process) which interevent times fluctuate about some average value, obeying an autoregressive process with very small damping. The power spectrum of the process can be expressed by the Hooge formula. The proposed models reveal possible origin of 1/f noise, i.e., random increments of the time intervals between pulses or interevent time of the process (Brownian motion in the time axis).
