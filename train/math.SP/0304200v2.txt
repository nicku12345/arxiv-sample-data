In this paper an analytic proof of a generalization of a theorem of Bismut ([Bis1, Theorem 5.1]) is given, which says that, when v is a transversal holomorphic vector field on a compact complex manifold X with a zero point set Y, the embedding j:Y\to X induces a natural isomorphism between the holomorphic equivariant cohomology of X via v with coefficients in \xi and the Dolbeault cohomology of Y with coefficients in \xi|_Y, where \xi\to X is a holomorphic vector bundle over X.
