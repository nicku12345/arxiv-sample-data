Given a parameterized space of square matrices, the associated set of eigenvectors forms some kind of a structure over the parameter space. When is that structure a vector bundle? When is there a vector field of eigenvectors? We answer those questions in terms of three obstructions, using a Homotopy Theory approach. We illustrate our obstructions with five examples. One of those examples gives rise to a 4 by 4 matrix representation of the Complex Quaternions. This representation shows the relationship of the Biquaternions with low dimensional Lie groups and algebras, Electro-magnetism, and Relativity Theory. The eigenstructure of this representation is very interesting, and our choice of notation produces important mathematical expressions found in those fields and in Quantum Mechanics. In particular, we show that the Doppler shift factor is analogous to Berry's Phase.
