We give an integral representaion of the zeta-reguralized determinant of Laplacians on three dimensional Heisenberg manifolds, and study a behaivior of the values when we deform the uniform discrete subgroups. Heiseberg manifolds are the total space of a fiber bundle with a torus as the base space and a circle as a typical fiber, then the deformation of the uniform discrete subgroups means that the "radius" of the fiber goes to zero. We explain the lines of the calculations precisely for three dimensional cases and state the corresponding results for five dimensional Heisenberg manifolds. We see that the values themselves are of the product form with a factor which is that of the flat torus. So in the last half of this paper we derive general formulas of the zeta-regularized determinant for product type manifolds of two Riemannian manifolds, discuss the formulas for flat tori and explain a relation of the formula for the two dimensional flat torus and Kronecker's second limit formula.
