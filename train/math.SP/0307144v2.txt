We study the problem of the existence and nonexistence of positive solutions to a superlinear second-order divergence type elliptic equation with measurable coefficients (*): -\nabla\cdot a\cdot\nabla u=u^p in an unbounded cone--like domain G\subset\bf R^N (N\ge 3). We prove that the critical exponent p^*(a,G)=\inf\{p>1 : (*) \hbox{has a positive supersolution in} G\} for a nontrivial cone-like domain is always in (1,N/(N-2)) and in contrast with exterior domains depends both on the geometry of the domain G and the coefficients a of the equation.
