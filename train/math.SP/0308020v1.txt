In this paper we introduce and study a one-parameter family of piecewise analytic interval maps having the tent map and the Farey map as extrema. Among other things, we construct a Hilbert space of analytic functions left invariant by the Perron-Frobenius operator of all these maps and study the transition between discrete and continuous spectrum when approaching the intermittent situation.
