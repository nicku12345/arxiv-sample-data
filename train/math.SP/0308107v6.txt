Let (M,g,\si) be a compact Riemannian spin manifold of dimension \geq 2. For any metric \tilde g conformal to g, we denote by \tilde\lambda the first positive eigenvalue of the Dirac operator on (M,\tilde g,\si). We show that \inf_{\tilde{g} \in [g]} \tilde\lambda \Vol(M,\tilde g)^{1/n} \leq (n/2) \Vol(S^n)^{1/n}. This inequality is a spinorial analogue of Aubin's inequality, an important inequality in the solution of the Yamabe problem. The inequality is already known in the case n \geq 3 and in the case n = 2, \ker D=\{0\}. Our proof also works in the remaining case n=2, \ker D\neq \{0\}. With the same method we also prove that any conformal class on a Riemann surface contains a metric with 2\tilde\lambda^2\leq \tilde\mu, where \tilde\mu denotes the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplace operator.
