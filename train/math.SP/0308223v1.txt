This paper has two themes that are intertwined: The first is the dynamics of certain piecewise affine maps on the Euclidean space that arise from a class of analog-to-digital conversion methods called Sigma-Delta quantization. The second is the analysis of reconstruction error associated to each such method. Sigma-Delta quantization generates approximate representations of functions by sequences that lie in a restricted set of discrete values. These are special sequences in that their local averages track the function values closely, thus enabling simple convolutional reconstruction. In this paper, we are concerned with the approximation of constant functions only, a basic case that presents surprisingly complex behavior. An m'th order Sigma-Delta scheme with input x can be translated into a dynamical system that produces a discrete-valued sequence (in particular, a 0-1 sequence) q as its output. When the schemes are stable, we show that the underlying piecewise affine maps possess invariant sets that tile the Euclidean space up to a finite multiplicity. When this multiplicity is one (the single-tile case), the dynamics within the tile is isomorphic to that of a generalized skew translation on the m dimensional torus. The value of x can be approximated using any consecutive M elements in q with increasing accuracy in M. We show that the asymptotical behavior of reconstruction error depends on the regularity of the invariant sets, the order m, and some arithmetic properties of x. We determine the behavior in a number of cases of practical interest and provide good upper bounds in some other cases when exact analysis is not yet available.
