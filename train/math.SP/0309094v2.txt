We discuss a functional model for multi--diagonal selfadjoint operators with almost periodic coefficients that generalizes the well known model for finite band Jacobi matrices. It give us an opportunity to construct examples of almost periodic operators with different spectral properties.   Main result deals with an exact condition for the uniqueness of the model of the given type.
