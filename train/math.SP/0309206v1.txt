We announce three results in the theory of Jacobi matrices and Schr\"odinger operators. First, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a measure to be the spectral measure of a Schr\"odinger operator -\f{d^2}{dx^2} +V(x) on L^2 (0,\infty) with V\in L^2 (0,\infty) and u(0)=0 boundary condition. Second, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the Jacobi parameters for the associated orthogonal polynomials to have Szeg\H{o} asymptotics. Finally, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on a measure to be the spectral measure of a Jacobi matrix with exponential decay at a given rate.
