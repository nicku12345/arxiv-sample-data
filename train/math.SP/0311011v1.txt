A non-linear functional Q[u,v] is given that governs the loss, respectively gain, of (doubly degenerate) eigenvalues of fourth order differential operators L = \partial^4 + \partial u \partial + v on the line. Apart from factorizing L as A^{*}A + E_{0}, providing several explicit examples, and deriving various relations between u, v and eigenfunctions of L, we find u and v such that L is isospectral to the free operator L_{0} = \partial^{4} up to one (multiplicity 2) eigenvalue E_{0} < 0. Not unexpectedly, this choice of u, v leads to exact solutions of the corresponding time-dependent PDE's.
