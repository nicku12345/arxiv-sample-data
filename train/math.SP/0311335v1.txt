Let \Gamma be a principal congruence subgroup of SL_n(Z) and let \sigma be an irreducible representation of SO(n). Let N(T,\sigma) be the counting function of the eigenvalues of the Casimir operator acting in the space of cusp forms for \Gamma which transform under SO(n) according to \sigma. We prove that the counting function N(T,\sigma) satisfies Weyl's law as T\to\infty. Especially this implies that there exist infinitely many cusp forms for the full modular group SL_n(Z).
