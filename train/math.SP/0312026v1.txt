The Hamiltonian of a system of three quantum mechanical particles moving on the three-dimensional lattice \Z^3 and interacting via zero-range attractive potentials is considered. For the two-particle energy operator h(k), with k\in \T^3=(-\pi,\pi]^3 the two-particle quasi-momentum, the existence of a unique positive eigenvalue below the bottom of the continuous spectrum of h(k) for k\neq0 is proven, provided that h(0) has a zero energy resonance. The location of the essential and discrete spectra of the three-particle discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operator H(K), K\in \T^3 being the three-particle quasi-momentum, is studied. The existence of infinitely many eigenvalues of H(0) is proven. It is found that for the number N(0,z) of eigenvalues of H(0) lying below z<0 the following limit exists  \lim_{z\to 0-} \frac {N(0,z)}{\mid \log\mid z\mid\mid}=\cU_0  with \cU_0>0. Moreover, for all sufficiently small nonzero values of the three-particle quasi-momentum K the finiteness of the number  N(K,\tau_{ess}(K)) of eigenvalues of H(K) below the essential spectrum is established and the asymptotics for the number N(K,0) of eigenvalues lying below zero is given.
