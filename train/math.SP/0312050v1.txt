A system of three quantum particles on the three-dimensional lattice \Z^3 with arbitrary "dispersion functions" having non-compact support and interacting via short-range pair potentials is considered. The energy operators of the systems of the two-and three-particles on the lattice \Z^3 in the coordinate and momentum representations are described as bounded self-adjoint operators on the corresponding Hilbert spaces. For all sufficiently small nonzero values of the two-particle quasi-momentum k\in (-\pi,\pi]^3 the finiteness of the number of eigenvalues of the two-particle discrete Schr\"odinger operator h_\alpha(k) below the continuous spectrum is established. A location of the essential spectrum of the three-particle discrete Schr\"odinger operator H(K),K\in (-\pi,\pi]^3 the three-particle quasi-momentum, by means of the spectrum of h_\alpha(k) is described. It is established that the essential spectrum of H(K), K\in (-\pi,\pi]^3 consists of a finitely many bounded closed intervals.
