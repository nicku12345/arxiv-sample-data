Consider the operator  T=-{d^2dx^2}+x^2+q(x) in L^2(\mathbb{R}), where real functions q, q' and \int_0^xq(s)ds are bounded. In particular, q is periodic or almost periodic. The spectrum of T is purely discrete and consists of the simple eigenvalues \{\mu_n\}_{n=0}^\infty, \mu_n<\mu_{n+1}. We determine their asymptotics \mu_n = (2n+1) + (2\pi)^{-1}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}q(\sqrt{2n+1}\sin\theta)d\theta + O(n^{-1/3}).
