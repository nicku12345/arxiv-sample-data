We consider operators of the form H+V where H is the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator and V is a zero-order pseudo-differential operator which is quasi-periodic in an appropriate sense (one can take V to be multiplication by a periodic function for example). It is shown that the eigenvalues of H+V have asymptotics of the form \lambda_n(H+V)=\lambda_n(H)+W(\sqrt n)n^{-1/4}+O(n^{-1/2}\ln(n)) as n\to+\infty, where W is a quasi-periodic function which can be defined explicitly in terms of V.
