The aim of this paper is to derive (by using two operators, representable by a Jacobi matrix) a family of q-orthogonal polynomials, which turn to be dual to alternative q-Charlier polynomials. A discrete orthogonality relation and a three-term recurrence relation for these dual polynomials are explicitly obtained. The completeness property of dual alternative q-Charlier polynomials is also established.
