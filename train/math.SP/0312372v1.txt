Commutator relations are used to investigate the spectra of Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians, H = -\Delta + V({x}), acting on functions of a smooth, compact d-dimensional manifold M immersed in \bbr^{\nu}, \nu \geq d+1. Here \Delta denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and the real-valued potential--energy function V(x) acts by multiplication. The manifold M may be complete or it may have a boundary, in which case Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed.   It is found that the mean curvature of a manifold poses tight constraints on the spectrum of H. Further, a special algebraic r\^ole is found to be played by a Schr\"odinger operator with potential proportional to the square of the mean curvature: H_{g} := -\Delta + g h^2, where \nu = d+1, g is a real parameter, and h := \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{d} {\kappa_j}, with \{\kappa_j\}, j = 1, ..., d denoting the principal curvatures of M. For instance, by Theorem \ref{thm3.1} and Corollary \ref{cor4.5}, each eigenvalue gap of an arbitrary Schr\"odinger operator is bounded above by an expression using H_{1/4}. The "isoperimetric" parts of these theorems state that these bounds are sharp for the fundamental eigenvalue gap and for infinitely many other eigenvalue gaps.
