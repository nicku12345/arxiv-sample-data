In this paper, a discrete form of the Kato inequality for discrete magnetic Laplacians on graphs is used to study asymptotic properties of the spectrum of discrete magnetic Schrodinger operators. We use the existence of a ground state with suitable properties for the ordinary combinatorial Laplacian and semigroup domination to relate the combinatorial Laplacian with the discrete magnetic Laplacian.
