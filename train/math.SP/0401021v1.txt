We introduce and investigate the class of central potentials V_{\text{CIC}}(g^{2},\mu^{2},\ell,R;r)=-\frac{g^{2}}{R^{2}} (\frac{r}{R})^{4\ell} {[ 1+(\frac{1}{2\ell+1}) (\frac{r}{R})^{2\ell+1}]^{2}-1+\mu^{2}}^{-2}, which possess, in the context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, a number of \ell-wave bound states given by the (\ell-independent !) formula N_{\ell}^{\text{(CIC)}}(g^{2},\mu ^{2}) ={{\frac{1}{\pi}\sqrt{g^{2}+\mu^{2}-1} (\sqrt{\mu^{2}-1})^{-1} \arctan(\sqrt{\mu^{2}-1})}}. Here g and \mu are two arbitrary real parameters, \ell is the angular momentum quantum number, and the double braces denote of course the integer part. An extension of this class features potentials that possess the same number of \ell-wave bound states and behave as (a/r)^{2} both at the origin (r\to 0^{+}) and at infinity (r\to \infty), where a is an additional free parameter.
