We obtain, using the Birman-Schwinger method, upper limits on the total number of bound states and on the number of \ell-wave bound states of the semirelativistic spinless Salpeter equation. We also obtain a simple condition, in the ultrarelativistic case (m=0), for the existence of at least one \ell-wave bound states: C(\ell,p/(p-1)) \int_0^{\infty}dr r^{p-1} |V^-(r)|^p\ge 1, where C(\ell,p/(p-1)) is a known function of \ell and p>1.
