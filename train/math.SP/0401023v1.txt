We obtain, using the Birman-Schwinger method, a series of necessary conditions for the existence of at least one bound state applicable to arbitrary central potentials in the context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. These conditions yield a monotonic series of lower limits on the "critical" value of the strength of the potential (for which a first bound state appears) which converges to the exact critical strength. We also obtain a sufficient condition for the existence of bound states in a central monotonic potential which yield an upper limit on the critical strength of the potential.
