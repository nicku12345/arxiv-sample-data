We prove absence of absolutely continuous spectrum for discrete one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators on the whole line with certain ergodic potentials, V_\omega(n) = f(T^n(\omega)), where T is an ergodic transformation acting on a space \Omega and f: \Omega \to \R. The key hypothesis, however, is that f is discontinuous. In particular, we are able to settle a conjecture of Aubry and Jitomirskaya--Mandel'shtam regarding potentials generated by irrational rotations on the torus.   The proof relies on a theorem of Kotani, which shows that non-deterministic potentials give rise to operators that have no absolutely continuous spectrum.
