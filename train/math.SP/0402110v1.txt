Let f be a function on the unit circle and D_n(f) be the determinant of the (n+1)\times (n+1) matrix with elements \{c_{j-i}\}_{0\leq i,j\leq n} where c_m =\hat f_m\equiv \int e^{-im\theta} f(\theta) \f{d\theta}{2\pi}. The sharp form of the strong Szeg\H{o} theorem says that for any real-valued L on the unit circle with L,e^L in L^1 (\f{d\theta}{2\pi}), we have \[ \lim_{n\to\infty} D_n(e^L) e^{-(n+1)\hat L_0} = \exp \biggl(\sum_{k=1}^\infty k\abs{\hat L_k}^2\biggr) \] where the right side may be finite or infinite. We focus on two issues here: a new proof when e^{i\theta}\to L(\theta) is analytic and known simple arguments that go from the analytic case to the general case. We add background material to make this article self-contained.
