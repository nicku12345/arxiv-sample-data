We review the definition of a Lie manifold (M, \VV) and the construction of the algebra \Psi\sp{\infty}\sb{\VV}(M) of pseudodifferential operators on a Lie manifold (M, \VV). We give some concrete Fredholmness conditions for pseudodifferential operators in \Psi\sp{\infty}\sb{\VV}(M) for a large class of Lie manifolds (M, \VV). These Fredholmness conditions have applications to boundary value problems on polyhedral domains and to non-linear PDEs on non-compact manifolds. As an application, we determine the spectrum of the Dirac operator on a manifold with multi-cylindrical ends.
