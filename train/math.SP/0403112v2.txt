Let \mathbf{A} be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a separable Hilbert space \mathfrak{H} and \mathfrak{H}_0\subset\mathfrak{H} a closed invariant subspace of \mathbf{A}. Assuming that \mathfrak{H}_0 is of codimension 1, we study the variation of the invariant subspace \mathfrak{H}_0 under bounded self-adjoint perturbations \mathbf{V} of \mathbf{A} that are off-diagonal with respect to the decomposition \mathfrak{H}= \mathfrak{H}_0\oplus\mathfrak{H}_1. In particular, we prove the existence of a one-parameter family of dense non-closed invariant subspaces of the operator \mathbf{A}+\mathbf{V} provided that this operator has a nonempty singularly continuous spectrum. We show that such subspaces are related to non-closable densely defined solutions of the operator Riccati equation associated with generalized eigenfunctions corresponding to the singularly continuous spectrum of \mathbf{B}.
