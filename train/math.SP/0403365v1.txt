We consider the operators H_0=M_0^{-1}(x) P(D) and H =M^{-1} (x) P(D) where M_0 (x) and M (x) are positively definite bounded matrix-valued functions and P(D) is an elliptic differential operator. Our main result is that the wave operators for the pair H_0, H exist and are complete if the difference  M(x)-M_0(x)=O(|x|^{- rho}),  rho>d, as |x| to infty. Our point is that no special assumptions on M_0(x) are required. Similar results are obtained in scattering theory for the wave equation.
