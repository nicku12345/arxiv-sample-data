We establish a method for giving lower bounds for the fundamental tone of elliptic operators in divergence form in terms of the divergence of vector fields. We then apply this method to the L_{r} operator associated to immersed hypersurfaces with locally bounded (r+1)-th mean curvature H_{r+1} of the space forms \mathbb{N}^{n+1}(c) of curvature c. As a corollary we give lower bounds for the extrinsic radius of closed hypersurfaces of \mathbb{N}^{n+1}(c) with H_{r+1}>0 in terms of the r-th and (r+1)-th mean curvatures. Finally we observe that bounds for the Laplace eigenvalues essentially bound the eigenvalues of a self-adjoint elliptic differential operator in divergence form. This allows us to show that Cheeger's constant gives a lower bounds for the first nonzero L_{r}-eigenvalue of a closed hypersurface of \mathbb{N}^{n+1}(c).
