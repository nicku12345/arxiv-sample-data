Let G be a connected and simply connected semisimple algebraic group over \Bbb Q and let \Gamma\subset G(\Bbb Q) be an arithmetic subgroup. Let K_\infty\subset G(\Bbb R) be a maximal compact subgroup and let d be the dimension of the symmetric space G({\mathbb R})/K_\infty. Let \sigma be an irreducible unitary representation of K_\infty. We prove that for every \Gamma there exists a normal subgroup \Gamma_1\subset \Gamma of finite index such that the quotient of the counting function of the \Gamma_1-cuspidal spectrum of weight \sigma and T^{d/2} has a positive lower bound as T\to\infty.
