In this paper, we describe families of those bounded linear operators on a separable Hilbert space that are simultaneously unitarily equivalent to integral operators on L_2(R) with bounded and arbitrarily smooth Carleman kernels. The main result is a qualitative sharpening of an earlier result of [7].
