This paper is devoted to semi-classical aspects of symplectic reduction. Consider a compact prequantizable Kahler manifold M with a Hamiltonian torus action. Guillemin and Sternberg introduced an isomorphism between the invariant part of the quantum space associated to M and the quantum space associated to the symplectic quotient of M, provided this quotient is non-singular.   We prove that this isomorphism is a Fourier integral operator and that the Toeplitz operators of M descend to Toeplitz operators of the reduced phase space. We also extend these results to the case where the symplectic quotient is an orbifold and estimate the spectral density of a reduced Toeplitz operator, a result related to the Riemann-Roch-Kawazaki theorem.
