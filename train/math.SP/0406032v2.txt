Let L^k be a high power of a hermitian holomorphic line bundle over a complex manifold X. Given a differential form f on X, we define a super Toeplitz operator T(f) acting on the space of harmonic (0,q)-forms with values in L^k, with symbol f. The asymptotic distribution of its eigenvalues, when k tends to infinity, is obtained in terms of the symbol of the operator and the curvature of the line bundle L, given certain conditions on the curvature. For example, already when q=0 this generalizes a result of Boutet de Monvel and Guillemin to semi-positive line bundles. The asymptotics are obtained from the asymptotics of the Bergman kernels of the corresponding harmonic spaces. Applications to sampling are also given.
