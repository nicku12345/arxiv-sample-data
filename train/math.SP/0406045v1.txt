The purpose of this paper is to prove that the spectrum of an isotropic Maxwell operator with electric permittivity and magnetic permeability that are periodic along certain directions and tending to a constant super-exponentially fast in the remaining directions is purely absolutely continuous. The basic technical tools is a new ``operatorial'' identity relating the Maxwell operator to a vector-valued Schrodinger operator. The analysis of the spectrum of that operator is then handled using ideas developed by the same authors in a previous paper.
