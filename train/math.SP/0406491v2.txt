We study the behavior of the limit of the spectrum of a non self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville operator with analytic potential as the semi-classical parameter h\to 0. We get a good description of the spectrum and limit spectrum near \infty. We also study the action of one special perturbation of the operator (adding a Heaviside function), and prove that the limit spectrum is very unstable. As an illustration we describe the limit spectrum as h\to 0 for P^h=-h^2\Delta+i x^2 and the effect of this perturbation.
