As a consequence of a result of Cardoso and Vodev, we show that the resolvent of the Laplacian on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds is analytic in an exponential neighbourhood of the critical line. The case of non-trapping metrics with constant curvature near infinity is also considered: there exists a strip with at most a finite number of resonances.
