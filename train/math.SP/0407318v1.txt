Let D be a domain of finite Lebesgue measure in \bR^d and let X^D_t be the symmetric \alpha-stable process killed upon exiting D. Each element of the set \{\lambda_i^\alpha\}_{i=1}^\infty of eigenvalues associated to X^D_t, regarded as a function of \alpha\in(0,2), is right continuous. In addition, if D is Lipschitz and bounded, then each  \lambda_i^\alpha is continuous in \alpha and the set of associated eigenfunctions is precompact. We also prove that if D is a domain of finite Lebesgue measure, then for all 0<\alpha<\beta\leq 2 and i\geq 1, \[\lambda_i^\alpha \leq [ \lambda^\beta_i]^{\alpha/\beta}.\] Previously, this bound had been known only for \beta=2 and \alpha rational.
