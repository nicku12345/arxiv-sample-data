In dimension d\geq 3, we give examples of nontrivial, compactly supported, complex-valued potentials such that the associated Schr\"odinger operators have no resonances. If d=2, we show that there are potentials with no resonances away from the origin. These Schr\"odinger operators are isophasal and have the same scattering phase as the Laplacian on \Real^d. In odd dimensions d\geq 3 we study the fundamental solution of the wave equation perturbed by such a potential. If the space variables are held fixed, it is super-exponentially decaying in time.
