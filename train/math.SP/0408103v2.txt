Consider n points distributed uniformly in [0,1]^d. Form a graph by connecting two points if their mutual distance is no greater than r(n). This gives a random geometric graph, \gnrn, which is connected for appropriate r(n). We show that the spectral measure of the transition matrix of the simple random walk (\abbr{srw}) on \gnrn is concentrated, and in fact converges to that of the graph on the deterministic grid.
