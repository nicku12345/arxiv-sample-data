We study resonances associated to Schr\"odinger operators with compactly supported potentials on {\mathbb R}^d, d\geq3, odd. We consider compactly supported potentials depending holomorphically on a complex parameter z. For certain such families, for all z except those in a pluripolar set, the associated resonance-counting function has order of growth d. Our proofs use some results from several complex variables.
