We consider the Jacobi matrix generated by a balanced measure of hyperbolic polynomial map. The conjecture of Bellissard says that this matrix should have an extremely strong periodicity property. We show how this conjecture is related to a certain noncommutative version of Bowen--Ruelle theory, and how the two weight Hilbert transform naturally appears in this context.
