We prove the long standing conjecture in the theory of two-point boundary value problems that completeness and Dunford's spectrality imply Birkhoff regularity. In addition we establish the even order part of S.G.Krein's conjecture that dissipative differential operators are Birkhoff-regular and give sharp estimate of the norms of spectral projectors in the odd case.   Considerations are based on a new direct method, exploiting \textit{almost orthogonality} of Birkhoff's solutions of the equation l(y)=\lambda y, which was discovered earlier by the author.
