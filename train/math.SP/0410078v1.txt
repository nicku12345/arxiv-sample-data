The paper studies the existence of minimizers for Rayleigh quotients \mu_{\Omega}=\inf\frac{\int_\Omega|\nabla u|^2}{\int_\Omega V{|u|^2}} , where \Omega is a domain in \mathbb{R}^N, and V is a nonzero nonnegative function that may have singularities on \partial\Omega. As a model for our results one can take \Omega to be a Lipschitz cone and V to be the Hardy potential V(x)=\frac{1}{|x|^2} .
