We prove the existence of sectors of minimal growth for general closed extensions of elliptic cone operators under natural ellipticity conditions. This is achieved by the construction of a suitable parametrix and reduction to the boundary. Special attention is devoted to the clarification of the analytic structure of the resolvent.
