If \mathcal H is a Hilbert space, \mathcal S \subseteq \mathcal H is a closed subspace of \mathcal H, and A  is a positive bounded linear operator on \mathcal H, the spectral shorted operator \rho(\mathcal S, A) is defined as the infimum of the sequence \Sigma (\mathcal S, A^n)^{1/n}, where \Sigma (\mathcal S, B) denotes the shorted operator of B to \mathcal S. We characterize the left spectral resolution of \rho(\mathcal S, A) and show several properties of this operator, particularly in the case that \dim \mathcal S = 1. We use these results to generalize the concept of Kolmogorov complexity for the infinite dimesional case and for non invertible operators.
