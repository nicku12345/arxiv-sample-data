We consider unitary analogs of d-dimensional Anderson models on l^2(\Z^d) defined by the product U_\omega=D_\omega S where S is a deterministic unitary and D_\omega is a diagonal matrix of i.i.d. random phases. The operator S is an absolutely continuous band matrix which depends on parameters controlling the size of its off-diagonal elements. We adapt the method of Aizenman-Molchanov to get exponential estimates on fractional moments of the matrix elements of U_\omega(U_\omega -z)^{-1}, provided the distribution of phases is absolutely continuous and the parameters correspond to small off-diagonal elements of S. Such estimates imply almost sure localization for U_\omega.
