In asymptotic expansions of resolvent traces \Tr(A(P-\lambda)^{-1}) for classical pseudodifferential operators on closed manifolds, the coefficient C_0(A,P) of (-\lambda)^{-1} is of special interest, since it is the first coefficient containing nonlocal elements from A; on the other hand if A=I and P=D^*D it gives part of the index of D. C_0(A,P) also equals the zeta function value at 0 when P is invertible. C_0(A,P) is a trace modulo local terms, since C_0(A,P)-C_0(A,P') and C_0([A,A'],P) are local. By use of complex powers P^s (or similar holomorphic families of order s), Okikiolu, Kontsevich and Vishik, Melrose and Nistor showed formulas for these trace defects in terms of residues of operators defined from A, A', \log P and \log P'.   The present paper has two purposes: One is to show how the trace defect formulas can be obtained from the resolvents in a simple way without use of the complex powers of P as in the original proofs. We here also give a simple direct proof of a recent residue formula of Scott for C_0(I,P). The other purpose is to establish trace defect residue formulas for operators on manifolds with boundary, where complex powers are not easily accessible; we do this using only resolvents. We also generalize Scott's formula to boundary problems.
