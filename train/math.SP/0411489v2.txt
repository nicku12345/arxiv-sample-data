We establish criteria for the stability of the essential spectrum for unbounded operators acting in Banach modules. The applications cover operators acting on sections of vector fiber bundles over non-smooth manifolds or locally compact abelian groups, in particular differential operators of any order with complex measurable coefficients on an euclidean space, singular Dirac operators, and Laplace-Beltrami operators on Riemannian manifolds with measurable metrics.
