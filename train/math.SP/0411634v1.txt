We study the asymptotic behaviour of regularized determinants of certain Laplace type operators with respect to singular deformations of the underlying manifold which are obtained by stretching a tubular neighborhood of an embedded separating hypersurface to a cylinder of infinite length. Using the asymptotic expansions, we derive adiabatic splitting formulas for regularized determinants of Laplace type operators.
