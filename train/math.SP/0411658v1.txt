Let \mathbf{a} be a quadratic form associated with a Schr\"odinger operator L=-\nabla\cdot(A\nabla)+V on a domain \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d. If \mathbf{a} is nonnegative on C_0^{\infty}(\Omega), then either there is W>0 such that \int W|u|^2 dx\leq \mathbf{a}[u] for all C_0^{\infty}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}), or there is a sequence \phi_k\in C_0^{\infty}(\Omega) and a function \phi>0 satisfying L\phi=0 such that \mathbf{a}[\phi_k]\to 0, \phi_k\to\phi locally uniformly in \Omega\setminus\{x_0\}. This dichotomy is equivalent to the dichotomy between L being subcritical resp. critical in \Omega. In the latter case, one has an inequality of Poincar\'e type: there exists W>0 such that for every \psi\in C_0^\infty(\Omega;\mathbb{R}) satisfying \int \psi \phi dx \neq 0 there exists a constant C>0 such that C^{-1}\int W|u|^2 dx\le \mathbf{a}[u]+C|\int u \psi dx|^2 for all u\in C_0^\infty(\Omega;\mathbb{R}).
