We review an exact WKB resolution method for the stationary 1D Schr\"odinger equation with a general polynomial potential. This contribution covers already published material: we supply a commented summary here, stressing a few aspects which were less highlighted before. As some of our earlier papers needed later corrections, we also recapitulate these here in footnotes in the bibliography. The latter, not meant to be exhaustive, focuses on narrowly relevant works plus some broader ones that do offer more extensive bibliographies.
