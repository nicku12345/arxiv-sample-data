We prove the meromorphic extension to C for the resolvent of the Laplacian on a class of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds with infinite volume and we give a polynomial bound on the number of resonances. This class notably contains the geometrically finite quotients with rational non-maximal rank cusps previously studied by Froese-Hislop-Perry.
