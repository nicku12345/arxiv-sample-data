A model operator H corresponding to a three-particle discrete Schr\"odinger operator on a lattice \Z^3 is studied. The essential spectrum is described via the spectrum of two Friedrichs models with parameters h_\alpha(p), \alpha=1,2, p \in \T^3=(-\pi,\pi]^3. The following results are proven:   1) The operator H has a finite number of eigenvalues lying below the bottom of the essential spectrum in any of the following cases: (i) both operators h_\alpha(0), \alpha=1,2, have a zero eigenvalue; (ii) either h_1(0) or h_2(0) has a zero eigenvalue.   2) The operator H has infinitely many eigenvalues lying below the bottom and accumulating at the bottom of the essential spectrum, if both operators h_\alpha(0),\alpha=1,2, have a zero energy resonance.
