We study the existence and nonexistence of positive (super-)solutions to a singular semilinear elliptic equation -\nabla\cdot(|x|^A\nabla u)-B|x|^{A-2}u=C|x|^{A-\sigma}u^p in cone--like domains of \R^N (N\ge 2), for the full range of parameters A,B,\sigma,p\in\R and C>0. We provide a complete characterization of the set of (p,\sigma)\in\R^2 such that the equation has no positive (super-)solutions, depending on the values of A,B and the principle Dirichlet eigenvalue of the cross--section of the cone.   The proofs are based on the explicit construction of appropriate barriers and involve the analysis of asymptotic behavior of super-harmonic functions associated to the Laplace operator with critical potentials, Phragmen--Lindel\"of type comparison arguments and an improved version of Hardy's inequality in cone--like domains.
