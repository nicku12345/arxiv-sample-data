Two-particle discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operators H(k)=H_{0}(k)-V on the three-dimensional lattice \Z^3, k being the two-particle quasi-momentum, are considered. An estimate for the number of the eigenvalues lying outside of the band of H_{0}(k) via the number of eigenvalues of the potential operator V bigger than the width of the band of H_{0}(k) is obtained. The existence of non negative eigenvalues below the band of H_{0}(k) is proven for nontrivial values of the quasi-momentum k\in \T^3\equiv (-\pi,\pi]^3, provided that the operator H(0) has either a zero energy resonance or a zero eigenvalue. It is shown that the operator H(k), k\in \T^3, has infinitely many eigenvalues accumulating at the bottom of the band from below if one of the coordinates k^{(j)},j=1,2,3, of k\in \T^3 is \pi.
