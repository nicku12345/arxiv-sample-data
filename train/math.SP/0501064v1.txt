A. Reid showed that if \Gamma_1 and \Gamma_2 are arithmetic lattices in G = \operatorname{PGL}_2(\mathbb R) or in \operatorname{PGL}_2(\mathbb C) which give rise to isospectral manifolds, then \Gamma_1 and \Gamma_2 are commensurable (after conjugation). We show that for d \geq 3 and {\mathcal S} = \operatorname{PGL}_d(\mathbb R) / \operatorname{PGO}_d(\mathbb R), or {\mathcal S} = \operatorname{PGL}_d(\mathbb C) / \operatorname{PU}_d(\mathbb C), the situation is quite different: there are arbitrarily large finite families of isospectral non-commensurable compact manifolds covered by \mathcal S.   The constructions are based on the arithmetic groups obtained from division algebras with the same ramification points but different invariants.
