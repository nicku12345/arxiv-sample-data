We prove a general Borg-type result for reflectionless unitary Cantero-Moral-Velazquez (CMV) operators U associated with orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. The spectrum of U is assumed to be a connected arc on the unit circle. This extends a recent result of Simon in connection with a periodic CMV operator with spectrum the whole unit circle.   In the course of deriving the Borg-type result we also use exponential Herglotz representations of Caratheodory functions to prove an infinite sequence of trace formulas connected with the CMV operator U.
