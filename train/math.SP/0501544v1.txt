Consider the scattering amplitude s(\omega,\omega^\prime;\lambda), \omega,\omega^\prime\in{\Bbb S}^{d-1}, \lambda > 0, corresponding to an arbitrary short-range magnetic field B(x), x\in{\Bbb R}^d. This is a smooth function of \omega and \omega^\prime away from the diagonal \omega=\omega^\prime but it may be singular on the diagonal. If d=2, then the singular part of the scattering amplitude (for example, in the transversal gauge) is a linear combination of the Dirac function and of a singular denominator. Such structure is typical for long-range scattering. We refer to this phenomenon as to the long-range Aharonov-Bohm effect. On the contrary, for d=3 scattering is essentially of short-range nature although, for example, the magnetic potential A^{(tr)}(x) such that {\rm curl} A^{(tr)}(x)=B(x) and <A^{(tr)}(x),x>=0 decays at infinity as |x|^{-1} only. To be more precise, we show that, up to the diagonal Dirac function (times an explicit function of \omega), the scattering amplitude has only a weak singularity in the forward direction \omega = \omega^\prime.   Our approach relies on a construction in the dimension d=3 of a short-range magnetic potential A (x) corresponding to a given short-range magnetic field B(x).
