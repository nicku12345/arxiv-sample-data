Two different self-adjoint Pauli extensions describing a spin-1/2 two-dimensional quantum system with singular magnetic field are studied. An Aharonov-Casher type formula is proved for the maximal Pauli extension and it is also checked that this extension can be approximated by operators corresponding to more regular magnetic fields.
