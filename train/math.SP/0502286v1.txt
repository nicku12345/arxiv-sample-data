We prove two improved versions of the Hardy-Rellich inequality for the polyharmonic operator (-\Delta)^m involving the distance to the boundary. The first involves an infinite series improvement using logarithmic functions, while the second contains L^2 norms and involves as a coefficient the volume of the domain. We find explicit constants for these inequalities, and we prove their optimality in the first case.
