We prove that the Szeg\H{o} function, D(z), of a measure on the unit circle is entire meromorphic if and only if the Verblunsky coefficients have an asymptotic expansion in exponentials. We relate the positions of the poles of D(z)^{-1} to the exponential rates in the asymptotic expansion. Basically, either set is contained in the sets generated from the other by considering products of the form, z_1 ... z_\ell \bar z_{\ell-1}... \bar z_{2\ell-1} with z_j in the set. The proofs use nothing more than iterated Szeg\H{o} recursion at z and 1/\bar z.
