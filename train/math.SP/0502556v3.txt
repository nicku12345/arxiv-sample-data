This paper is part of a series papers devoted to geometric and spectral theoretic applications of the hypoelliptic calculus on Heisenberg manifolds. More specifically, in this paper we make use of the Heisenberg calculus of Beals-Greiner and Taylor to analyze the spectral theory of hypoelliptic operators on Heisenberg manifolds. The main results of this paper include: (i) Obtaining complex powers of hypoelliptic operators as holomorphic families of Psi_{H}DO's, which can be used to define a scale of weighted Sobolev spaces interpolating the weighted Sobolev spaces of Folland-Stein and providing us with sharp regularity estimates for hypoelliptic operators on Heisenberg manifolds; (ii) Criterions on the principal symbol of P to invert the heat operator P+\partial_{t} and to derive the small time heat kernel asymptotics for P; (iii) Weyl asymptotics for hypoelliptic operators which can be reformulated geometrically for the main geometric operators on CR and contact manifolds, that is, the Kohn Laplacian, the horizontal sublaplacian and its conformal powers, as well as the contact Laplacian. For dealing with complex powers of hypoelliptic operators we cannot make use of the standard approach of Seeley, so we rely on a new approach based on the pseudodifferential approach representation of the heat kernel. This is especially suitable for dealing with positive hypoelliptic operators. We will deal with more general operator in a forthcoming paper using another new approach.
