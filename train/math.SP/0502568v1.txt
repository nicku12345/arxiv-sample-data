We study the semi-classical trace formula at a critical energy level for a Schr\"odinger operator on \mathbb{R}^{n}. We assume here that the potential has a totally degenerate critical point associated to a local maximum. The main result, which establishes the contribution of the associated equilibrium in the trace formula, is valid for all time in a compact subset of \mathbb{R} and includes the singularity in t=0. For these new contributions the asymptotic expansion involves the logarithm of the parameter h. Depending on an explicit arithmetic condition on the dimension and the order of the critical point, this logarithmic contribution can appear in the leading term.
