We establish sufficiency conditions in order to achieve approximation to discrete eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators in the second-order projection method suggested recently by Levitin and Shargorodsky, [math.SP/0212087]. We find explicit estimates for the eigenvalue error and study in detail two concrete model examples. Our results show that, unlike the majority of the standard methods, second-order projection strategies combine non-pollution and approximation at a very high level of generality.
