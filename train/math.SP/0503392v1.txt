We show that the parameters a_n, b_n of a Jacobi matrix have a complete asymptotic series  a_n^2 -1 &= \sum_{k=1}^{K(R)} p_k(n) \mu_k^{-2n} + O(R^{-2n}) b_n &= \sum_{k=1}^{K(R)} p_k(n) \mu_k^{-2n+1} + O(R^{-2n})  where 1 < |\mu_j| < R for j\leq K(R) and all R if and only if the Jost function, u, written in terms of z (where E=z+z^{-1}) is an entire meromorphic function. We relate the poles of u to the \mu_j's.
