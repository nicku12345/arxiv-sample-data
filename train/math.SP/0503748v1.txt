Electromagnetics and Acoustics on a bounded domain are governed by the Helmholtz's equation; when such a domain is a [pre-]fractal described by means of a `just-touching' Iterated Function System (IFS) spectral decomposition of the Helmholtz's operator is self-similar as well. Renormalization of the Green's function proves this feature and isolates a subclass of eigenmodes, called ``diaperiodic'', whose waveforms and eigenvalues can be recursively computed applying the IFS to the initiator's eigenspaces. The definition of ``spectral dimension'' is given and proven to depend on diaperiodic modes only for a wide class of IFSs. Finally, asymptotic equivalence between box-counting and spectral dimensions in the fractal limit is proven. As the `self-similar' spectrum of the fractal is enough to compute box-counting dimension, positive answer is given to title question.
