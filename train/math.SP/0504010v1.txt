We discuss the spectral properties of collisional semigroups associated to various models from transport theory by exploiting the links between the so-called resolvent approach and the semigroup approach. Precisely, we show that the essential spectrum of the full transport semigroup coincides with that of the collisionless transport semigroup in any L^p--spaces (1 <p < \infty) for three 2D--transport models with Maxwell--boundary conditions.
