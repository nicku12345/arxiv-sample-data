We consider the spectrum of a two-dimensional Pauli operator with a compactly supported electric potential and a variable magnetic field with a positive mean value. The rate of accumulation of eigenvalues to zero is described in terms of the logarithmic capacity of the support of the electric potential. A connection between these eigenvalues and orthogonal polynomials in complex domains is established.
