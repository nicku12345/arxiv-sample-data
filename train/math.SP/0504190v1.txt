A family A_\alpha of differential operators depending on a real parameter \alpha\ge 0 is considered. This family was suggested by Smilansky as a model of an irreversible quantum system. We find the absolutely continuous spectrum \sigma_{a.c.} of the operator A_\alpha and its multiplicity for all values of the parameter. The spectrum of A_0 is purely a.c. and admits an explicit description. It turns out that for \alpha<\sqrt 2 one has \sigma_{a.c.}(A_\alpha)= \sigma_{a.c.}(A_0), including the multiplicity. For \alpha\ge\sqrt2 an additional branch of absolutely continuous spectrum arises, its source is an auxiliary Jacobi matrix which is related to the operator A_\alpha. This birth of an extra-branch of a.c. spectrum is the exact mathematical expression of the effect which was interpreted by Smilansky as irreversibility.
