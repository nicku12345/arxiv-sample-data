In this paper the authors show how to use Riemann-Hilbert techniques to prove various results, some old, some new, in the theory of Toeplitz operators and orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC's). There are four main results: the first concerns the approximation of the inverse of a Toeplitz operator by the inverses of its finite truncations. The second concerns a new proof of the `hard' part of Baxter's theorem, and the third concerns the Born approximation for a scattering problem on the lattice \mathbb{Z}_+. The fourth and final result concerns a basic proposition of Golinskii-Ibragimov arising in their analysis of the Strong Szeg\"{o} Limit Theorem.
