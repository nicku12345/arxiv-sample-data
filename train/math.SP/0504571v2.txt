We show that for compact orientable hyperbolic orbisurfaces, the Laplace spectrum determines the length spectrum as well as the number of singular points of a given order. The converse also holds, giving a full generalization of Huber's theorem to the setting of compact orientable hyperbolic orbisurfaces.
