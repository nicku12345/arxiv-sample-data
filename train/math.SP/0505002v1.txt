We introduce conservative curved systems over multiply connected domains and study relationships of such systems with related notions of functional model, characteristic function, and transfer function. In contrast to standard theory for the unit disk, characteristic functions and transfer functions are essentially different objects. We study possibility to recover the characteristic function for a given transfer function. As the result we obtain the procedure to construct the functional model for a given conservative curved system. We employ the functional model to solve some problems in perturbation theory.
