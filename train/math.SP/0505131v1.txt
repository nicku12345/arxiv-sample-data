A one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator perturbed by a smooth compactly supported potential is considered. For the corresponding eigenvalues \lambda_n, a complete asymptotic expansion for large n is obtained, and the coefficients of this expansion are expressed in terms of the heat invariants. A sequence of trace formulas is obtained, expressing regularised sums of integer powers of eigenvalues \lambda_n in terms of the heat invariants.
