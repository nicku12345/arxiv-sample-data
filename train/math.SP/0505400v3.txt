We obtain asymptotic lower bounds for the spectral function of the Laplacian and for the remainder in local Weyl's law on manifolds. In the negatively curved case, thermodynamic formalism is applied to improve the estimates. Key ingredients of the proof include the wave equation parametrix, a pretrace formula and the Dirichlet box principle. Our results develop and extend the unpublished thesis of A. Karnaukh.
