In this paper we are interested in spectral decomposition of an unbounded operator with discrete spectrum. We show that if A generates a polynomially bounded n-times integrated group whose spectrum set \sigma(A)=\{i\lambda_k; k\in\mathbb{Z}^* \} is discrete and satisfies \sum \frac{1}{|\lambda_k|^\ell\delta_k^n}<\infty (n and \ell nonnegative integers), then there exists projectors (P_k)_{k\in\mathbb{Z}^*} such that \sum P_kx=x ( x\in D(A^{n+\ell})), where \delta_k=\min(\frac{| \lambda_{k+1}-\lambda_k|}2, \frac{|\lambda_{k-1}-\lambda_k|}2).
