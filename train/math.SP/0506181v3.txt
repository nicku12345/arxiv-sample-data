We establish two-sided estimates for the fundamental frequency (the lowest eigenvalue) of the Laplacian in an open subset G of R^n with the Dirichlet boundary condition. This is done in terms of the interior capacitary radius of G which is defined as the maximal possible radius of a ball B which has a negligible intersection with the complement of G. Here negligibility of a subset F in B means that the Wiener capacity of F does not exceed gamma times the capacity of B, where gamma is an arbitrarily fixed constant between 0 and 1. We provide explicit values of constants in the two-sided estimates.
