We study the small eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian on collaping torus bundles with bounded curvature. In the first part of this dissertation, we consider examples of bundles on S^1 and T^2 with homogeneous structure. In the second part, we give a lower bound of the first non-zero eigenvalue of the 1-form Laplacian on principal torus bundles.
