We consider Dirichlet eigenfunctions u_\lambda of the Bunimovich stadium S, satisfying (\Delta - \lambda^2) u_\lambda = 0. Write S = R \cup W where R is the central rectangle and W denotes the ``wings,'' i.e. the two semicircular regions. It is a topic of current interest in quantum theory to know whether eigenfunctions can concentrate in R as \lambda \to \infty. We obtain a lower bound C \lambda^{-2} on the L^2 mass of u_\lambda in W, assuming that u_\lambda itself is L^2-normalized; in other words, the L^2 norm of u_\lambda is controlled by \lambda^2 times the L^2 norm in W. Moreover, if u_\lambda is a o(\lambda^{-2}) quasimode, the same result holds, while for a o(1) quasimode we prove that L^2 norm of u_\lambda is controlled by \lambda^4 times the L^2 norm in W. We also show that the L^2 norm of u_\lambda may be controlled by the integral of w \abs{\partial_N u}^2 along \partial S \cap W, where w is a smooth factor on W vanishing at R \cap W. These results complement recent work of Burq-Zworski which shows that the L^2 norm of u_\lambda is controlled by the L^2 norm in any pair of strips contained in R, but adjacent to W.
