The spectral properties of the Schr\"odinger operator T_ty= -y''+q_ty in L^2(\R) are studied, with a potential q_t(x)=p_1(x), x<0,  and q_t(x)=p(x+t), x>0,  where p_1, p are periodic potentials and t\in \R is a parameter of dislocation. Under some conditions there exist simultaneously gaps in the continuous spectrum of T_0 and eigenvalues in these gaps. The main goal of this paper is to study the discrete spectrum and the resonances of T_t. The following results are obtained: i) In any gap of T_t there exist 0,1 or 2 eigenvalues. Potentials with 0,1 or 2 eigenvalues in the gap are constructed. ii) The dislocation, i.e. the case p_1=p is studied. If t\to 0, then in any gap in the spectrum there exist both eigenvalues ( \le 2 ) and resonances ( \le 2 ) of T_t which belong to a gap on the second sheet and their asymptotics as t\to 0  are determined. iii) The eigenvalues of the half-solid, i.e. p_1={\rm constant}, are also studied. iv) We prove that for any even 1-periodic potential p and any sequences \{d_n\}_1^{\iy}, where d_n=1 or d_n=0 there exists a unique even 1-periodic potential p_1 with the same gaps and d_n eigenvalues of T_0 in the n-th gap for each n\ge 1.
