In this paper we generalize and improve results proven for acoustic operators in \cite{jmp,long}. It deals with the behavior of the integrated density of states of random divergence operators of the form H\_\omega=\sum\_{i,j=1}^d\partial\_{x\_{i}}a\_{i,j}(\omega,x)\partial\_{x\_j} ; on the internal band edges of the spectrum. We propose an application of such a result to get localization.
