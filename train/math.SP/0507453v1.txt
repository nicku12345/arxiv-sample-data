In this thesis we study the geometry of the fixed point set \Sigma of a smooth mapping \Phi: M\to M on a smooth compact Riemannian manifold M without boundary by computing the asymptotic expansion of the deformed heat trace \Trace \Phi\exp(t\Delta) of the Laplace operator \Delta on M. We assume that the fixed point set \Sigma is a union of connected components, each of which is a smooth compact submanifold of M without boundary. The deformed heat trace asymptotics is determined by contributions of each connected component, so each of them can be studied separately. We develop a generalized Laplace method for computing the coefficients of this asymptotic expansion and compute the first three coefficients explicitly in the following cases: 1) zero- and one-dimensional components of the fixed point set of \Phi in a flat two-dimensional manifold; 2) zero-dimensional component of the fixed point set of \Phi in a curved manifold.
