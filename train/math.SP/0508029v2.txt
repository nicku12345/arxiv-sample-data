A model operator H associated to a system of three-particles on the three dimensional lattice \Z^3 and interacting via pair non-local potentials is studied. The following results are proven: (i) the operator H has infinitely many eigenvalues lying below the bottom of the essential spectrum and accumulating at this point, in the case, where both Friedrichs model operators h_{\mu_\alpha}(0),\alpha=1,2, have threshold resonances. (ii) the operator H has a finite number of eigenvalues lying outside of the essential spectrum, in the case, where at least one of h_{\mu_\alpha}(0), \alpha=1,2, has a threshold eigenvalue.
