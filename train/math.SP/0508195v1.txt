Let G be a locally compact group and \mu a probability measure on G, which is not assumed to be absolutely continuous with respect to Haar measure. Given a unitary representation (\pi, \cal H) of G, we study spectral properties of the operator \pi(\mu) acting on \cal H. Assume that \mu is adapted and that the trivial representation 1_G is not weakly contained in the tensor product \pi\otimes \bar\pi. We show that \pi(\mu) has a spectral gap, that is, for the spectral radius r_{\rm spec}(\pi(\mu)) of \pi(\mu), we have r_{\rm spec}(\pi(\mu))<1. This provides a common generalization of several previously known results. Another consequence is that, if G has Kazhdan's Property (T), then r_{\rm spec}(\pi(\mu))<1 for every unitary representation \pi of G without finite dimensional subrepresentations. Moreover, we give new examples of so-called identity excluding groups.
