In this paper the realization problems for the Krein-Langer class N_\kappa of matrix-valued functions are being considered. We found the criterion when a given matrix-valued function from the class N_\kappa can be realized as linear-fractional transformation of the transfer function of canonical conservative system of the M. Livsic type (Brodskii-Livsic rigged operator colligation) with the main operator acting on a rigged Pontryagin space \Pk with indefinite metric. We specify three subclasses of the class N_\kappa(R) of all realizable matrix-valued functions that correspond to different properties of a realizing system, in particular, when the domains of the main operator of a system and its conjugate coincide, when the domain of the hermitian part of a main operator is dense in \Pi\kappa. Alternatively we show that the class N_\kappa(R) can be realized as transfer matrix-functions of some canonical impedance systems with self-adjoint main operators in rigged spaces \Pk. The case of scalar functions of the class N_\kappa(R) is considered in details and some examples are presented.
