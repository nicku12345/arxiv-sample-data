Let \mu be a non-trivial probability measure on the unit circle \partial\bbD, w the density of its absolutely continuous part, \alpha_n its Verblunsky coefficients, and \Phi_n its monic orthogonal polynomials. In this paper we compute the coefficients of \Phi_n in terms of the \alpha_n. If the function \log w is in L^1(d\theta), we do the same for its Fourier coefficients. As an application we prove that if \alpha_n \in \ell^4 and Q(z) = \sum_{m=0}^N q_m z^m is a polynomial, then with \bar Q(z) = \sum_{m=0}^N \bar q_m z^m and S the left shift operator on sequences we have |Q(e^{i\theta})|^2 \log w(\theta) \in L^1(d\theta) if and only if \{\bar Q(S)\alpha\}_n \in \ell^2. We also study relative ratio asymptotics of the reversed polynomials \Phi_{n+1}^*(\mu)/\Phi_n^*(\mu)-\Phi_{n+1}^*(\nu)/\Phi_n^*(\nu) and provide a necessary and sufficient condition in terms of the Verblunsky coefficients of the measures \mu and \nu for this difference to converge to zero uniformly on compact subsets of \bbD.
