This memoir deals with the hypoelliptic calculus on Heisenberg manifolds, or Heisenberg calculus. The Heisenberg manifolds generalize CR and contact manifolds and in this context the main differential operators at stake include the H\"ormander's sum of squares, the Kohn Laplacian, the horizontal sublaplacian and its conformal powers and the contact Laplacian. These operators cannot be elliptic and the relevant pseudodifferential calculus to study them is provided by the Heisenberg calculus. The aim of this monograph is threefold. First, we give an intrinsic approach to the Heisenberg calculus by finding an intrinsic notion of principal symbol in this setting. This framework allows us to prove that the pointwise invertibility of a principal symbol, which can be restated in terms of the so-called Rockland condition, actually implies its global invertibility. Second, we study complex powers of hypoelliptic operators on Heisenberg manifolds in terms of the Heisenberg calculus. In particular, we show that complex powers of such operators give rise to holomorphic families in the Heisenberg calculus and we construct a scale of weighted Sobolev spaces providing us with sharp estimates for the operators in the Heisenberg calculus. Third, we make use of the Heisenberg calculus and of the results of this monograph to derive spectral asymptotics for hypoelliptic operators on Heisenberg manifolds. The advantage of using the Heisenberg calculus is illustrated by reformulating in a geometric fashion these asymptotics for the main geometric operators on CR and contact manifolds.
