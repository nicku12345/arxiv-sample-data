We review recent advances in the spectral theory of Schr\"odinger operators with decaying potentials. The area has seen spectacular progress in the past few years, stimulated by several conjectures stated by Barry Simon starting at the 1994 International Congress on Mathematical Physics in Paris. The one-dimensional picture is now fairly complete, and provides many striking spectral examples. The multidimensional picture is still far from clear and may require deep original ideas for further progress. It might hold the keys for better understanding of a wide range of spectral and dynamical phenomena for Schr\"odinger operators in higher dimensions.
