We review recent and give some new results on the spectral properties of Schroedinger operators with a random potential of alloy type. Our point of interest is the so called Wegner estimate in the case where the single site potentials change sign. The indefinitness of the single site potential poses certain difficulties for the proof of the Wegner estimate which are still not fully understood.   The Wegner estimate is a key ingredient in an existence proof of pure point spectrum of the considered random Schroedinger operators. Under certain assumptions on the considered models additionally the existence of the density of states can be proven.
