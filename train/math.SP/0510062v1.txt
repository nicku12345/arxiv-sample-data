We study Schroedinger operators with a random potential of alloy type. The single site potentials are allowed to change sign. For a certain class of them we prove a Wegner estimate. This is a key ingredient in an existence proof of pure point spectrum of the considered random Schroedinger operators. Our estimate is valid for all bounded energy intervals and all space dimensions and implies the existence of the density of states.
