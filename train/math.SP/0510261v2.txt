Let G\subset \O(n) be a group of isometries acting on n-dimensional Euclidean space \R^n, and {\bf{X}} a bounded domain in \R^n which is transformed into itself under the action of G. Consider a symmetric, classical pseudodifferential operator A_0 in \L^2(\R^n) with G-invariant Weyl symbol, and assume that it is semi-bounded from below. We show that the spectrum of the Friedrichs extension A of the operator \mathrm{res} \circ A_0 \circ \mathrm{ext}: \CT({\bf{X}}) \to \L^2({\bf{X}}) is discrete, and derive asymptotics for the number N_\chi(\lambda) of eigenvalues of A less or equal \lambda and with eigenfunctions in the \chi-isotypic component of \L^2({\bf{X}}), giving also an estimate for the remainder term in both cases where G is a finite, or, more generally, a compact group. In particular, we show that the multiplicity of each unitary irreducible representation in \L^2({\bf{X}}) is asymptotically proportional to its dimension.
