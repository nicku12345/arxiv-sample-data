We study a family of differential operators L_\alpha in two variables, depending on the coupling parameter \alpha\ge0 that appears only in the boundary conditions. Our main concern is the spectral properties of L_\alpha, which turn out to be quite different for \alpha\le 1 and for \alpha>1. In particular,   L_\alpha has a unique self-adjoint realization for \alpha\le 1 and many such realizations for \alpha>1. In the more difficult case \alpha>1 an analysis of non-elliptic pseudodifferential operators in dimension one is involved.
