We strengthen and generalise a result of Kirsch and Simon on the behaviour of the function N_L(E), the number of bound states of the operator L = \Delta+V in \R^d below -E. Here V is a bounded potential behaving asymptotically like P(\omega)r^{-2} where P is a function on the sphere. It is well known that the eigenvalues of such an operator are all nonpositive, and accumulate only at 0. If the operator \Delta_{S^{d-1}}+P on the sphere has negative eigenvalues -\mu_1,...,-\mu_n less than -(d-2)^2/4, we prove that N_L(E) may be estimated as \[ N_L(E)) = \frac{\log(E^{-1})}{2\pi}\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{\mu_i-(d-2)^2/4} +O(1); \] thus, in particular, if there are no such negative eigenvalues then L has a finite discrete spectrum. Moreover, under some additional assumptions including that d=3 and that there is exactly one eigenvalue -\mu_1 less than -1/4, with all others > -1/4, we show that the negative spectrum is asymptotic to a geometric progression with ratio \exp(-2\pi/\sqrt{\mu_1 - \qtr}).
