Developed in 1999 by Akemann, Anderson, and Weaver, the spectral scale of an n\times n matrix A, is a convex, compact subset of \mathbb{R}^3 that reveals important spectral information about A \cite{AAW}. In this paper we present new information found in the spectral scale of a matrix. Given a matrix A=A_1 + iA_2 with A_1 and A_2 self-adjoint and A_2\neq 0, we show that faces in the boundary of the spectral scale of A that are parallel to the x-axis describe elements of \sigma(A_1,A_2)\bigcap\mathbb{R}, the real elements of the spectrum of the linear pencil P(\lambda)=A_1 + \lambda A_2.
