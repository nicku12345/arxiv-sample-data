We provide a comparative treatment of some aspects of spectral theory for self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint (but J-self-adjoint) Dirac-type operators connected with the defocusing and focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, of relevance to nonlinear optics.   In addition to a study of Dirac and Hamiltonian systems, we also introduce the concept of Weyl-Titchmarsh half-line m-coefficients (and 2 x 2 matrix-valued M-matrices) in the non-self-adjoint context and derive some of their basic properties. We conclude with an illustrative example showing that crossing spectral arcs in the non-self-adjoint context imply the blowup of the norm of spectral projections in the limit where the crossing point is approached.
