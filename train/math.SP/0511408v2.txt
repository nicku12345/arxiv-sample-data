We give both lower and upper estimates for eigenvalues of unbounded positive definite operators in an arbitrary Hilbert space. We show scaling robust relative eigenvalue estimates for these operators in analogy to such estimates of current interest in Numerical Linear Algebra. Only simple matrix theoretic tools like Schur complements have been used. As prototypes for the strength of our method we discuss a singularly perturbed Schroedinger operator and study convergence estimates for finite element approximations. The estimates can be viewed as a natural quadratic form version of the celebrated Temple--Kato inequality.
