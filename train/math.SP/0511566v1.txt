The discrete spectrum of complex banded matrices which are compact perturbations of the standard banded matrix of order p is under consideration. The rate of stabilization for the matrix entries sharp in the sense of order which provides finiteness of the discrete spectrum is found. The p-banded matrix with the discrete spectrum having exactly p preassigned points on the interval (-2,2) is constructed. The results are applied to the study of the discrete spectrum of asymptotically periodic complex Jacobi matrices.
