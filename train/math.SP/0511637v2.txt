This paper presents Stieltjes-type integration for operator-valued functions with respect to spectral families. The relation between Riemann-Stieltjes integrals associated with some classes of spectral families including, in particular, those that arise in the context of the Stone representation theorem for Banach spaces is established. The developed approach is applied to the structural analysis of the operators commuting with a one-parameter representation satisfying the Generalized Stone theorem.
