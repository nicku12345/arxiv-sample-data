In this paper we prove a sufficient condition, in terms of the behavior of a ground state of a symmetric critical operator P_1, such that a nonzero subsolution of a symmetric nonnegative operator P_0 is a ground state. Particularly, if P_j:=-\Delta+V_j, for j=0,1, are two nonnegative Schr\"odinger operators defined on \Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d such that P_1 is critical in \Omega with a ground state \phi, the function \psi\nleq 0 is a subsolution of the equation P_0u=0 in \Omega and satisfies |\psi|\leq C\phi in \Omega, then P_0 is critical in \Omega and \psi is its ground state. In particular, \psi is (up to a multiplicative constant) the unique positive supersolution of the equation P_0u=0 in \Omega. Similar results hold for general symmetric operators, and also on Riemannian manifolds.
