Let F be a real-valued convex function on the complex plane, and let Ps(b) be a pseudodifferential operator with symbol b. Under certain natural assumptions about properties of pseudodifferential operators, we prove that the sum of F(z) over all eigenvalues z of the operator Ps(b) counted with their multiplicities does not exceed the real part of the trace of Ps(F(b)) modulo a term of the same order as the error term in the Garding inequality.
