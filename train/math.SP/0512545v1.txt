Let A be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space \fH. Assume that the spectrum of A consists of two disjoint components \sigma_0 and \sigma_1 such that the convex hull of the set \sigma_0 does not intersect the set \sigma_1. Let V be a bounded self-adjoint operator on \fH off-diagonal with respect to the orthogonal decomposition \fH=\fH_0\oplus\fH_1 where \fH_0 and \fH_1 are the spectral subspaces of A associated with the spectral sets \sigma_0 and \sigma_1, respectively. It is known that if \|V\|<\sqrt{2}d where d=\dist(\sigma_0,\sigma_1)>0 then the perturbation V does not close the gaps between \sigma_0 and \sigma_1. Assuming that f is an eigenvector of the perturbed operator A+V associated with its eigenvalue in the interval (\min(\sigma_0)-d,\max(\sigma_0)+d) we prove that under the condition \|V\|<\sqrt{2}d the (acute) angle \theta between f and the orthogonal projection of f onto \fH_0 satisfies the bound \tan\theta\leq\frac{\|V\|}{d} and this bound is sharp.
