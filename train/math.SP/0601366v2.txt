We show that, under some very weak assumption of effective variation for the magnetic field, a periodic Schr\"odinger operator with magnetic wells on a noncompact Riemannian manifold M such that H^1(M, \R)=0 equipped with a properly disconnected, cocompact action of a finitely generated, discrete group of isometries has an arbitrarily large number of spectral gaps in the semi-classical limit.
