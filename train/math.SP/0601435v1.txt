We provide sufficient conditions under which the difference of the resolvents of two higher-order operators acting in \R^N belongs to trace classes \cC^p. We provide explicit estimates on the norm of the resolvent difference in terms of L^p norms of the difference of the coefficients. Such inequalities are useful in estimating the effect of localized perturbations of the coefficients.
