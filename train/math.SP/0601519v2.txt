A notion of weighted multivariate majorization is defined as a preorder on sequences of vectors in Euclidean space induced by the Choquet ordering for atomic probability measures. We characterize this preorder both in terms of stochastic matrices and convex functions and use it to describe the distribution of equilibrium points of logarithmic potentials generated by discrete planar charge configurations. In the case of n positive charges we prove that the equilibrium points satisfy \binom{n}{2} weighted majorization relations and are uniquely determined by n-1 such relations. It is further shown that the Hausdorff geometry of the equilibrium points and the charged particles is controlled by the weighted standard deviation of the latter. By using finite-rank perturbations of compact normal Hilbert space operators we establish similar relations for infinite charge distributions. We also discuss a hierarchy of weighted de Bruijn-Springer relations and inertia laws, the existence of zeros of Borel series with positive l^1-coefficients, and an operator version of the Clunie-Eremenko-Rossi conjecture.
