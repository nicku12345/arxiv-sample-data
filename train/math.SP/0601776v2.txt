We relate two types of phase space distributions associated to eigenfunctions \phi_{ir_j} of the Laplacian on a compact hyperbolic surface X_{\Gamma}:   (1) Wigner distributions \int_{S^*\X} a dW_{ir_j}=< Op(a)\phi_{ir_j}, \phi_{ir_j}>_{L^2(\X)}, which arise in quantum chaos. They are invariant under the wave group.   (2) Patterson-Sullivan distributions PS_{ir_j}, which are the residues of the dynamical zeta-functions \lcal(s; a): = \sum_\gamma \frac{e^{-sL_\gamma}}{1-e^{-L_\gamma}} \int_{\gamma_0} a (where the sum runs over closed geodesics) at the poles s = {1/2} + ir_j. They are invariant under the geodesic flow.   We prove that these distributions (when suitably normalized) are asymptotically equal as r_j \to \infty. We also give exact relations between them. This correspondence gives a new relation between classical and quantum dynamics on a hyperbolic surface, and consequently a formulation of quantum ergodicity in terms of classical ergodic theory.
