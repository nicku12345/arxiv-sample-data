I consider two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with degenerating magnetic field and in the generic situation I derive spectral asymptotics as h\to +0 and \mu\to +\infty where h and \mu are Planck and coupling parameters respectively. The remainder estimate is O(\mu^{-{\frac 1 2}}h^{-1}) which is between O(\mu^{-1}h^{-1}) valid as magnetic field non-degenerates and O(h^{-1}) valid as magnetic field is identically 0. As \mu is close to its maximal reasonable value O(h^{-2}) the principal part contains correction terms associated with short periodic trajectories of the corresponding classical dynamics.
