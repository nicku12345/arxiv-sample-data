I consider magnetic Schr\"odinger operator in dimension d=2 assuming that coefficients are smooth and magnetic field is non-degenerating. Then I extend the remainder estimate O(\mu^{-1}h^{-1}+1) derived in \cite{Ivr1} for the case when V/F has no stationary points to the case when it has non-degenerating stationary points. If some of them are saddles and \mu^3h\ge 2 then asymptotics contains correction terms of magnitude \mu^{-1}h^{-1}|\log \mu^3 h|.
