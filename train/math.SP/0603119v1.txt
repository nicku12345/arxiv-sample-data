Survey: In this paper I consider sharp spectral asymptotics for multidimensional magnetic Schr\"odinger operator with irregular coefficients with respect to two parameters -- semiclassical parameter h and coupling parameter \mu. There are few principally different cases, depending on dimension, rank of magnetic intensity matrix, relation between h and \mu and some extra assumptions.
