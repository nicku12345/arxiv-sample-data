For a scattering system \{A_\Theta,A_0\} consisting of selfadjoint extensions A_\Theta and A_0 of a symmetric operator A with finite deficiency indices, the scattering matrix \{S_\gT(\gl)\} and a spectral shift function \xi_\Theta are calculated in terms of the Weyl function associated with the boundary triplet for A^* and a simple proof of the Krein-Birman formula is given. The results are applied to singular Sturm-Liouville operators with scalar and matrix potentials, to Dirac operators and to Schr\"odinger operators with point interactions.
