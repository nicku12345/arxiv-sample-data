We introduce an integrable lattice discretization of the quantum system of n bosonic particles on a ring interacting pairwise via repulsive delta potentials. The corresponding (finite-dimensional) spectral problem of the integrable lattice model is solved by means of the Bethe Ansatz method. The resulting eigenfunctions turn out to be given by specializations of the Hall-Littlewood polynomials. In the continuum limit the solution of the repulsive delta Bose gas due to Lieb and Liniger is recovered, including the orthogonality of the Bethe wave functions first proved by Dorlas (extending previous work of C.N. Yang and C.P. Yang).
