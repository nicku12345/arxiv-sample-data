A family of Friedrichs models with rank one perturbations h_\mu(p), p \in (-\pi,\pi]^3,\mu>0 associated to a system of two particles on the lattice \Z^3 is considered. The existence of a unique strictly positive eigenvalue below the bottom of the essential spectrum of h_\mu(p) for all nontrivial values p \in (-\pi,\pi]^3 under the assumption that h_\mu(0) has either a zero energy resonance (virtual level) or a threshold eigenvalue is proved. Low energy asymptotic expansion for the Fredholm determinant associated to family of Friedrichs models is obtained.
