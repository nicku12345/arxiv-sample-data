We study the structure and asymptotic behavior of the resolvent of elliptic cone pseudodifferential operators acting on weighted Sobolev spaces over a compact manifold with boundary. We obtain an asymptotic expansion of the resolvent as the spectral parameter tends to infinity, and use it to derive corresponding heat trace and zeta function expansions as well as an analytic index formula.
