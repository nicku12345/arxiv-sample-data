We examine two questions regarding Fourier frequencies for a class of iterated function systems (IFS). These are iteration limits arising from a fixed finite families of affine and contractive mappings in \br^d, and the ``IFS'' refers to such a finite system of transformations, or functions. The iteration limits are pairs (X, \mu) where X is a compact subset of \br^d, (the support of \mu) and the measure \mu is a probability measure determined uniquely by the initial IFS mappings, and a certain strong invariance axiom. The two questions we study are: (1) existence of an orthogonal Fourier basis in the Hilbert space L^2(X,\mu); and (2) the interplay between the geometry of (X, \mu) on the one side, and the spectral data entailed by possible Fourier bases.
