In this paper, we show that the convex domains of the hyperbolic space which are almost extremal for the Faber-Krahn or the Payne-Polya-Weinberger inequalities are close to geodesic balls. Our proof is also valid in other space forms and allows us to recover known results in Euclidean space and on the sphere.
