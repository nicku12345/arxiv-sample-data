In this paper we consider the wave operators W_{\pm} for a Schr\"odinger operator H in {\bf{R}}^n with n\geq 4 even and we discuss the L^p boundedness of W_{\pm} assuming a suitable decay at infinity of the potential V. The analysis heavily depends on the singularities of the resolvent for small energy, that is if 0-energy eigenstates exist. If such eigenstates do not exist W_{\pm}: L^p \to L^p are bounded for 1 \leq p \leq \infty otherwise this is true for  \frac{n}{n-2} < p < \frac{n}{2} . The extension to Sobolev space is discussed.
