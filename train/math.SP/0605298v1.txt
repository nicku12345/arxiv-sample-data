I continue analysis of the Schr\"odinger operator with the strong degenerating magnetic field, started in \cite{IRO6}. Now I consider 4-dimensional case, assuming that magnetic field is generic degenerated and under certain conditions I derive spectral asymptotics with the principal part \asymp h^{-4} and the remainder estimate O(\mu^{-1/2}h^{-3}) where \mu\gg 1 is the intensity of the field and h\ll 1 is the Plank constant; \mu h\le 1.   These asymptotics can contain correction terms of magnitude \mu ^{5/4}h^{-3/2} corresponding to the short periodic trajectories.
