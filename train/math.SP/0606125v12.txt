The purpose of this paper is to study the property of the resolvent of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a noncompact complete Riemannian manifold with various ends each of which has a different limit of the growth rate of the Riemannian measure at infinity, in particular, focusing on the limiting absorption principle. As a result, we will obtain the absolute continuity of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
