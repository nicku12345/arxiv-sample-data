Let P_h be a self-adjoint semiclassical pseudodifferential operator on a manifold M such that the bicharacteristic flow of the principal symbol on T^*M is completely integrable and the subprincipal symbol of P_h vanishes. Consider a semiclassical family of eigenfunctions, or, more generally, quasimodes u_h of P_h. We show that on a nondegenerate rational invariant torus, Lagrangian regularity of u_h (regularity under test operators characteristic on the torus) propagates both along bicharacteristics, and also in an additional ``diffractive'' manner. In particular, in addition to propagating along null bicharacteristics, regularity fills in the interiors of small annular tubes of bicharacteristics.
