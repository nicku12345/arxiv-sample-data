We consider the Neumann Laplacian with constant magnetic field on a regular domain. Let B be the strength of the magnetic field, and let \lambda_1(B) be the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Neumann Laplacian on the domain. It is proved that B \mapsto \lambda_1(B) is monotone increasing for large B. Combined with the results of \cite{FournaisHelffer3}, this implies that all the `third' critical fields for strongly Type II superconductors coincide.
