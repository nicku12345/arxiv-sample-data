Mourre's commutator theory is a powerful tool to study the continuous spectrum of self-adjoint operators and to develop scattering theory. We propose a new approach of its main result, namely the derivation of the limiting absorption principle from a so called Mourre estimate. We provide a new interpretation of this result.
