Consider the Jacobi operators \cJ given by (\cJ y)_n=a_ny_{n+1}+b_ny_n+a_{n-1}^*y_{n-1}, y_n\in \C^m (here y_0=y_{p+1}=0), where b_n=b_n^* and a_n:\det a_n\ne 0 are the sequences of m\ts m matrices, n=1,..,p. We study two cases: (i) a_n=a_n^*>0; (ii) a_n is a lower triangular matrix with real positive entries on the diagonal (the matrix \cJ is (2m+1)-band mp\ts mp matrix with positive entries on the first and the last diagonals). The spectrum of \cJ is a finite sequence of real eigenvalues \l_1<...<\l_N, where each eigenvalue \l_j has multiplicity k_j\le m. We show that the mapping (a,b)\mapsto \{(\l_j,k_j)\}_1^N\oplus \{additional spectral data \} is 1-to-1 and onto. In both cases (i), \nolinebreak (ii), we give the complete solution of the inverse problem.
