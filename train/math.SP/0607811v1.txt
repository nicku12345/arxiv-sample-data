Consider the operator H\p=-\p''+q\p=\l\p, \p(0)=0, \p'(1)+b\p(1)=0 acting in L^2(0,1), where q\in L^2(0,1) is a real potential. Let \l_n(q,b), n\ge 0, be the eigenvalues of H and \n_n(q,b) be the so-called norming constants. We give a complete characterization of all spectral data (\{\l_n\}_0^\iy;\{\n_n\}_0^\iy) that correspond to (q;b)\in L^2(0,1)\ts\R. If b is fixed, then we obtain a similar characterization and parameterize the iso-spectral manifolds.
