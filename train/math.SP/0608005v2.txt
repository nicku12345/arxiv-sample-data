We consider a periodic strip in the plane and the associated quantum waveguide with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We analyse finite segments of the waveguide consisting of L periodicity cells, equipped with periodic boundary conditions at the ``new'' boundaries. Our main result is that the distance between the first and second eigenvalue of such a finite segment behaves like L^{-2}.
