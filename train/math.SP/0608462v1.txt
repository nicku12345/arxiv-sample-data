Which properties of an orbifold can we ``hear,'' i.e., which topological and geometric properties of an orbifold are determined by its Laplace spectrum? We consider this question for a class of four-dimensional K\"{a}hler orbifolds: weighted projective planes M:=\C P^2(N_1,N_2,N_3) with three isolated singularities. We show that the spectra of the Laplacian acting on 0- and 1-forms on M determine the weights N_1, N_2, and N_3. The proof involves analysis of the heat invariants using several techniques, including localization in equivariant cohomology. We show that we can replace knowledge of the spectrum on 1-forms by knowledge of the Euler characteristic and obtain the same result. Finally, after determining the values of N_1, N_2, and N_3, we can hear whether M is endowed with an extremal K\"{a}hler metric.
