Let {\cal T}_\Lambda be the compact manifold of real symmetric tridiagonal matrices conjugate to a given diagonal matrix \Lambda with simple spectrum. We introduce {\it bidiagonal coordinates}, charts defined on open dense domains forming an explicit atlas for {\cal T}_\Lambda. In contrast to the standard inverse variables, consisting of eigenvalues and norming constants, every matrix in {\cal T}_\Lambda now lies in the interior of some chart domain. We provide examples of the convenience of these new coordinates for the study of asymptotics of isospectral dynamics, both for continuous and discrete time.
