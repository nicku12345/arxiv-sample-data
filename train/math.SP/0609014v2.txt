We derive bounds on the integrated density of states for a class of Schr\"odinger operators with a random potential. The potential depends on a sequence of random variables, not necessarily in a linear way. An example of such a random Schr\"odinger operator is the breather model, as introduced by Combes, Hislop and Mourre. For these models we show that the integrated density of states near the bottom of the spectrum behaves according to the so called Lifshitz asymptotics. This result can be used to prove Anderson localization in certain energy/disorder regimes.
