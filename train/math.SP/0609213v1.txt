We study asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of Strum--Liouville operators Ly= -y'' +q(x)y  with potentials from Sobolev spaces W_2^{\theta -1}, \theta \geqslant 0, including the non-classical case \theta \in [0,1) when the potentials are distributions. The results are obtained in new terms. Define the numbers  s_{2k}(q)= \lambda_{k}^{1/2}(q)-k, \quad s_{2k-1}(q)= \mu_{k}^{1/2}(q)-k-1/2,  where \{\lambda_k\}_1^{\infty} and \{\mu_k\}_1^{\infty} are the sequences of the eigenvalues of the operator L generated by the Dirichlet and Dirichlet--Neumann boundary conditions, respectivaly. We construct special Hilbert spaces \hat l_2^{\theta} such that the map F: W^{\theta-1}_2 \to \hat l_2^{\theta}, defined by formula F(q)=\{s_n\}_1^{\infty}, is well-defined for all \theta\geqslant 0. The main result is the following: for all fixed \theta>0 the map F is weekly nonlinear, i.e. it admits a representation of the form F(q) =Uq+\Phi(q), where U is the isomorphism between the spaces W^{\theta-1}_2  and \hat l_2^{\theta}, and \Phi(q) is a compact map. Moreover we prove the estimate \|\Phi(q)\|_{\tau} \leqslant C\|q\|_{\theta-1}, where the value of \tau=\tau(\theta)>\theta is given explicitly and the constant C depends only of the radius of the ball \|q\|_{\theta} \leqslant R but does not depend on the function q, running through this ball
