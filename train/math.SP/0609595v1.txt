We establish a uniform comparison between the spectrum of the rough Laplacian (acting on sections of a vector bundle of complex rank one or of harmonic curvature) with the spectrum of a discrete operator (a generalization of a discrete magnetic Laplacian added with a potential) acting on a finite dimensional space coming from a discretization process. As an application, we obtain a comparison of the first positive eigenvalue of the rough Laplacian with the holonomy.
