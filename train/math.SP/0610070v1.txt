We determine baryon-baryon bound states in 3+1 dimensional {\rm SU}(3) lattice QCD with two flavors, 4\times 4 spin matrices, and in an imaginary time formulation. For small hopping parameter, \kappa>0, and large glueball mass (strong coupling), we show the existence of three-quark isospin 1/2 particles (proton and neutron) and isospin 3/2 baryons (delta particles), with asymptotic masses -3\ln\kappa and isolated dispersion curves. We only consider the existence of bound states of total isospin I=0,3. Using a ladder approximation to a lattice Bethe-Salpeter equation, baryon-baryon bound states are found in these two sectors, with asymptotic masses -6\ln\kappa and binding energies of order \kappa^2. The dominant baryon-baryon interaction is an energy-independent spatial range-one potential with an {\cal O}(\kappa^2) strength. There is also attraction arising from gauge field correlations associated with six overlapping bonds, but it is counterbalanced by Pauli repulsion to give a vanishing zero-range potential. The overall range-one potential results from a quark, antiquark exchange with {\it no} meson exchange interpretation; the repulsive or attractive nature of the interaction does depend on the isospin and spin of the two-baryon state.
