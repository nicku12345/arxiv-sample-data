The indefinite Sturm-Liouville operator A = (\sgn x)(-d^2/dx^2+q(x)) is studied. It is proved that similarity of A to a selfadjoint operator is equivalent to integral estimates of Cauchy integrals. Also similarity conditions in terms of Weyl functions are given. For operators with a finite-zone potential, the components \Aess and \Adisc of A corresponding to essential and discrete spectrums, respectively, are considered. A criterion of similarity of \Aess to a selfadjoint operator is given in terms of Weyl functions for the Sturm-Liouville operator -d^2/dx^2+q(x) with a finite-zone potential q. Jordan structure of the operator \Adisc is described. We present an example of the operator A = (\sgn x)(-d^2/dx^2+q(x)) such that A is nondefinitizable and A is similar to a normal operator.
