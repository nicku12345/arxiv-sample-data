We consider the self-adjoint operator H=H_0+V, where H_0 is the free semi-classical Dirac operator on R^3. We suppose that the smooth matrix-valued potential V=O(<x>^{-\delta}), \delta>0, has an analytic continuation in a complex sector outside a compact. We define the resonances as the eigenvalues of the non-selfadjoint operator obtained from the Dirac operator H by a complex distortions of R^{3}.We establish an upper bound O(h^{-3}) for the number of resonances in any compact domain. For \delta>3, a representation of the derivative of the spectral shift function \xi(\lambda,h) related to the semi-classical resonances of H and a local trace formula are obtained. In particular, if V is an electro-magnetic potential, we deduce a Weyl-type asymptotic of the spectral shift function. As a by-product, we obtain an upper bound O(h^{-2}) for the number of resonances close to non-critical energy levels in domains of width h and a Breit-Wigner approximation formula for the derivative of the spectral shift function.
