We examine the validity of certain spectral integral formulas in topological rings. We consider the sign and square-root functions in polymetric rings containing \frac12. It turns out that formal analogues of classical transformation kernels and the resolvent identity can be used to understand the situation. In the lack of \frac12, the functions \frac12-\frac12\sgn(\frac12-z) and \frac12-\sqrt{\frac14-z} can be generalized, respectively.
