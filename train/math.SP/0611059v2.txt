We analyze the problem of approximating a smooth quantum waveguide with a quantum graph. We consider a planar curve with compactly supported curvature and a strip of constant width around the curve. We rescale the curvature and the width in such a way that the strip can be approximated by a singular limit curve, consisting of one vertex and two infinite, straight edges, i.e. a broken line. We discuss the convergence of the Laplacian, with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the strip, in a suitable sense and we obtain two possible limits: the Laplacian on the line with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the origin and a non trivial family of point perturbations of the Laplacian on the line. The first case generically occurs and corresponds to the decoupling of the two components of the limit curve, while in the second case a coupling takes place. We present also two families of curves which give rise to coupling.
