We analyze the long time behavior of solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation i\psi_t=(-\Delta-b/r+V(t,x))\psi, x\in\RR^3, r=|x|, describing a Coulomb system subjected to a spatially compactly supported time periodic potential V(t,x)=V(t+2\pi/\omega,x) with zero time average. We show that, for any V(t,x) of the form 2\Omega(r)\sin (\omega t-\theta), with \Omega(r) nonzero on its support, Floquet bound states do not exist. This implies that the system ionizes, {\em i.e.} P(t,K)=\int_K|\psi(t,x)|^2dx\to 0 as t\to\infty for any compact set K\subset\RR^3. Furthermore, if the initial state is compactly supported and has only finitely many spherical harmonic modes, then P(t,K) decays like t^{-5/3} as t \to \infty . To prove these statements, we develop a rigorous WKB theory for infinite systems of ordinary differential equations.
