I consider 4-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with the generic non-degenerating magnetic field and for a generic potential I derive spectral asymptotics with the remainder estimate O(\mu^{-1}h^{-3}) and the principal part \asymp h^{-4} where h\ll 1 is Planck constant and \mu \gg 1 is the intensity of the magnetic field. For general potentials remainder estimate O(\mu^{-1}h^{-3}+\mu^2h^{-2}) is achieved.
