The zero modes and zero resonances of the Dirac operator H=\alpha\cdot D + Q(x) are discussed, where   \alpha= (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3) is the triple of 4 \times 4 Dirac matrices,  D=\frac{1}{i} \nabla_x, and Q(x)=\big(q_{jk} (x) \big) is a 4\times 4 Hermitian matrix-valued function with   | q_{jk}(x) | \le C < x >^{-\rho} , \rho >1.   We shall show that every zero mode f(x) is continuous on {\mathbb R}^3 and decays at infinity with the decay rate |x|^{-2}. Also, we shall show that H has no zero resonance if \rho > 3/2.
