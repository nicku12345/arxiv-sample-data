We consider ergodic random magnetic Schr\"odinger operators on the metric graph \mathbb{Z}^d with random potentials and random boundary conditions taking values in a finite set. We show that normalized finite volume eigenvalue counting functions converge to a limit uniformly in the energy variable. This limit, the integrated density of states, can be expressed by a closed Shubin-Pastur type trace formula. It supports the spectrum and its points of discontinuity are characterized by existence of compactly supported eigenfunctions. Among other examples we discuss percolation models.
