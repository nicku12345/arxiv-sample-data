We prove that a dissipative operator in Krein space possesses a maximal non-negative invariant subspace provided that this operator admits matrix representation with respect to canonical decomposition of the space and the right upper entry of the operator matrix is relatively compact with respect to the right lower entry. Under additional condition when the left upper and left lower operators are bounded (the so-called "Langer condition") this result was proved (in the increasing order of generality) by Pontryagin, Krein, Langer, and Azizov. The Langer condition is replaced in the paper by a much weaker condition. We also prove: if a dissipative operator A in Krein space is maximal then there exists a maximal non-negative invariant subspace \mathcal L_+ such that the spectrum of the restriction A_+ = A|_{\mathcal L_+} lies in the closed left half-plane. We found sufficient conditions in terms of the entries of A which garantee that A_+ is the generator of a holomorphic or C_0-semigroup.
