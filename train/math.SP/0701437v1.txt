Consider the Hill operator Ty=-y''+q'(t)y in L^2(\R), where q\in L^2(0,1) is a 1-periodic real potential. The spectrum of T is is absolutely continuous and consists of bands separated by gaps \g_n,n\ge 1 with length |\g_n|\ge 0. We obtain a priori estimates of the gap lengths, effective masses, action variables for the KDV. For example, if \m_n^\pm are the effective masses associated with the gap \g_n=(\l_n^-,\l_n^+), then |\m_n^-+\m_n^+|\le C|\g_n|^2n^{-4} for some constant C=C(q) and any n\ge 1. In order prove these results we use the analysis of a conformal mapping corresponding to quasimomentum of the Hill operator. That makes possible to reformulate the problems for the differential operator as the problems of the conformal mapping theory. Then the proof is based on the analysis of the conformal mapping and the identities. Moreover, we obtain the similar estimates for the Dirac operator.
