For Kleinian groups acting on hyperbolic three-space, we prove factorization formulas for both the Selberg zeta-function and the automorphic scattering matrix. We extend results of Venkov and Zograf from Fuchsian groups, to Kleinian groups, and we give a proof that is simple and extendable to more general groups.
