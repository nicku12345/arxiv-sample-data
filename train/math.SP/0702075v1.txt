We prove an abstract criterion stating resolvent convergence in the case of operators acting in different Hilbert spaces. This result is then applied to the case of Laplacians on a family X_\eps of branched quantum waveguides. Combining it with an exterior complex scaling we show, in particular, that the resonances on X_\eps approximate those of the Laplacian with ``free'' boundary conditions on X_0, the skeleton graph of X_\eps.
