We establish a hierarchy of weighted majorization relations for the singularities of generalized Lam\'e equations and the zeros of their Van Vleck and Heine-Stieltjes polynomials as well as for multiparameter spectral polynomials of higher Lam\'e operators. These relations translate into natural dilation and subordination properties in the Choquet order for certain probability measures associated with the aforementioned polynomials. As a consequence we obtain new inequalities for the moments and logarithmic potentials of the corresponding root-counting measures and their weak-^* limits in the semi-classical and various thermodynamic asymptotic regimes. We also prove analogous results for systems of orthogonal polynomials such as Jacobi polynomials.
