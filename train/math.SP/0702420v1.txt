This paper addresses the problem of computing the eigenvalues lying in the gaps of the essential spectrum of a periodic Schrodinger operator perturbed by a fast decreasing potential. We use a recently developed technique, the so called quadratic projection method, in order to achieve convergence free from spectral pollution. We describe the theoretical foundations of the method in detail, and illustrate its effectiveness by several examples.
