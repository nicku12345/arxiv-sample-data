We study the two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau functional in a domain with corners for exterior magnetic field strengths near the critical field where the transition from the superconducting to the normal state occurs. We discuss and clarify the definition of this field and obtain a complete asymptotic expansion for it in the large \kappa regime. Furthermore, we discuss nucleation of superconductivity at the boundary.
