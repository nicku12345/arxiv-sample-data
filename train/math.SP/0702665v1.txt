We consider the semiclassical asymptotic behaviour of the number of eigenvalues smaller than E for elliptic operators in L\sp 2 ({\bf R}\sp d). We describe a method of finding remainder estimates related to the volume of the region of the phase space in which the principal symbol takes values belonging to the interval [E'-h; E'+h], where E' is close to E. This method allows to derive remainder estimates O(h\sp {1-d}) for a class of symbols with critical points and non-smooth coefficients.
