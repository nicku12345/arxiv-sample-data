An asymptotic formula for the number of states of Boson gas whose Hamiltonian is given by a positive elliptic pseudo-differential operator of order one on a compact manifold is given under a integrality assumption on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. This is regarded as an analogue of the Meinardus theorem on asymptotics of the number of partitions of a positive integer.
