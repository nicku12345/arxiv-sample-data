We consider the Schr\"odinger operator with a periodic potential on quasi-1D models of zigzag single-wall carbon nanotubes in magnetic field. The spectrum of this operator consists of an absolutely continuous part (intervals separated by gaps) plus an infinite number of eigenvalues with infinite multiplicity. We obtain identities and a priori estimates in terms of effective masses and gap lengths.
