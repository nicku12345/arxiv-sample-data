A p-adic Schr\"{o}dinger-type operator D^{\alpha}+V_Y is studied. D^{\alpha} (\alpha>0) is the operator of fractional differentiation and V_Y=\sum_{i,j=1}^nb_{ij}<\delta_{x_j}, \cdot>\delta_{x_i} (b_{ij}\in\mathbb{C}) is a singular potential containing the Dirac delta functions \delta_{x} concentrated on points \{x_1,...,x_n\} of the field of p-adic numbers \mathbb{Q}_p. It is shown that such a problem is well-posed for \alpha>1/2 and the singular perturbation V_Y is form-bounded for \alpha>1. In the latter case, the spectral analysis of \eta-self-adjoint operator realizations of D^{\alpha}+V_Y in L_2(\mathbb{Q}_p) is carried out.
