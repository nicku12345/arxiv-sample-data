We consider the Hamiltonian of a system of three quantum mechanical particles (two identical fermions and boson)on the three-dimensional lattice \Z^3 and interacting by means of zero-range attractive potentials. We describe the location and structure of the essential spectrum of the three-particle discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operator H_{\gamma}(K), K being the total quasi-momentum and \gamma>0 the ratio of the mass of fermion and boson.   We choose for \gamma>0 the interaction v(\gamma) in such a way the system consisting of one fermion and one boson has a zero energy resonance.   We prove for any \gamma> 0 the existence infinitely many eigenvalues of the operator H_{\gamma}(0). We establish for the number N(0,\gamma; z;) of eigenvalues lying below z<0 the following asymptotics  \lim_{z\to 0-}\frac{N(0,\gamma;z)}{\mid \log \mid z\mid \mid}={U} (\gamma) . Moreover, for all nonzero values of the quasi-momentum K \in T^3  we establish the finiteness of the number  N(K,\gamma;\tau_{ess}(K)) of eigenvalues of H(K) below the bottom of the essential spectrum and we give an asymptotics for the number N(K,\gamma;0) of eigenvalues below zero.
