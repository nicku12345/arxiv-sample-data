We consider the Hamiltonian of a system of three quantum mechanical particles on the three-dimensional lattice \Z^3 interacting via short-range pair potentials.   We prove for the two-particle energy operator h(k), k\in \T^3 the two-particle quasi-momentum, the existence of a unique positive eigenvalue z(k) lying below the essential spectrum under assumption that the operator h(0) corresponding to the zero value of k has a zero energy resonance.   We describe the location of the essential spectrum of the three-particle discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operators H(K),K the three-particle quasi-momentum by the spectra of h(k), k\in \T^3.   We prove the existence of infinitely many eigenvalues of H(0) and establish for the number of eigenvalues N(0,z) lying below z<0 the asymptotics   \begin{equation*}\label{asimz} \lim\limits_{z \to -0}\frac{N(0,z)}{|\log |z||}=\frac{\lambda_0}{2\pi}, \end{equation*} where \lambda_0 a unique positive solution of the equation  \lambda = \frac{8 \sinh \pi\lambda /6}{\sqrt 3 \cosh \pi\lambda/2}.   We prove that for all  K \in U_\delta^0(0), where U_\delta^0(0) some punctured \delta >0 neighborhood of the origin, the number N(K,0) of eigenvalues the operator H(K) below zero is finite and satisfy the asymptotics \begin{equation*}\label{asimk} \lim\limits_{|K| \to 0}\frac{N(K,0)}{|\log |K||}=\frac{\lambda_0}{\pi}. \end{equation*}
