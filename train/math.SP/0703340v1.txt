In this paper we consider the constant term \phi_K(y,s) of the non-normalized Eisenstein series attached to \PSL(2,\cO_K), where K is either \Q or an imaginary quadratic field of class number one. The main purpose of this paper is to show that for every a\ge 1 the zeros of the Dirichlet series \phi_K(a,s) admit a spectral interpretation in terms of eigenvalues of a natural self-adjoint operator \Delta_a. This implies that, except for at most two real zeros, all zeros of \phi_K(a,s) are on the critical line, and all zeros are simple. For K=\Q this is due to Lagarias and Suzuki and Ki.
