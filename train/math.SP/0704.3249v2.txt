Making use of recent techniques in the theory of selfadjoint extensions of symmetric operators, we characterize the class of point interaction Hamiltonians in a 3-D bounded domain with regular boundary. In the particular case of one point interaction acting in the center of a ball, we obtain an explicit representation of the point spectrum of the operator togheter with the corresponding related eigenfunctions. These operators are used to build up a model-system where the dynamics of a quantum particle depends on the state of a quantum bit.
