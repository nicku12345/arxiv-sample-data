We deal with the following eigenvalue optimization problem: Given a bounded domain D\subset \R^2, how to place an obstacle B of fixed shape within D so as to maximize or minimize the fundamental eigenvalue \lambda_1 of the Dirichlet Laplacian on D\setminus B. This means that we want to extremize the function \rho\mapsto \lambda_1(D\setminus \rho (B)), where \rho runs over the set of rigid motions such that \rho (B)\subset D. We answer this problem in the case where both D and B are invariant under the action of a dihedral group \mathbb{D}_n, n\ge2, and where the distance from the origin to the boundary is monotonous as a function of the argument between two axes of symmetry. The extremal configurations correspond to the cases where the axes of symmetry of B coincide with those of D.
