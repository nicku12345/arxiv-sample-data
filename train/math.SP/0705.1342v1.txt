The main result of this paper is a bound on the distance between the distribution of an eigenfunction of the Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold and the Gaussian distribution. If X is a random point on a manifold M and f is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian with L^2-norm one and eigenvalue -\mu, then d_{TV}(f(X),Z)\le\frac{2}{\mu}\E\big|\|\nabla f(X)\|^2-\E\|\nabla f(X) \|^2\big|. This result is applied to construct specific examples of spherical harmonics of arbitrary (odd) degree which are close to Gaussian in distribution. A second application is given to random linear combinations of eigenfunctions on flat tori.
