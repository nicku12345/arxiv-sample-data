Picone-type identities are established for half-linear ODEs of fourth order (one-dimensional p-biLaplacian). It is shown that in the linear case they reduce to the known identities for fourth order linear ODEs. Picone-type identity known for two half-linear second-order equations is also generalised to set of equations greater than two.
