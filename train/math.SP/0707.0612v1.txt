Let D\subset R^d be a bounded domain and let \[ L=\frac12\nabla\cdot a\nabla +b\cdot\nabla \] %\[ %L=\frac12\sum_{i,j=1}^da_{i,j}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i\partial x_j}+\sum_{i=1}^db_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}, %\] be a second order elliptic operator on D. Let \nu be a probability measure on D.   Denote by {\mathcal L} the differential operator whose domain is specified by the following non-local boundary condition:  {\mathcal D_{{\mathcal L}}}=\{f\in C^2(\ol{D}): \int_D f d\nu = f|_{\partial D}\},  and which coincides with L on its domain. It is known that \mathcal L possesses an infinite sequence of eigenvalues, and that with the exception of the zero eigenvalue, all eigenvalues have negative real part. Define the spectral gap of \mathcal {L}, indexed by \nu, by   \gamma_1(\nu)\equiv\sup\{\re \lambda:0\neq \lambda is an eigenvalue for {\mathcal L}\}.   In this paper we investigate the eigenvalues of \mathcal L in general and the spectral gap \gamma_1(\nu) in particular. The operator \mathcal L is the generator of a diffusion process with random jumps from the boundary, and \gamma_1(\nu) measures the exponential rate of convergence of this process to its invariant measure.
