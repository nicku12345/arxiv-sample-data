We consider a singular Sturm-Liouville expression with the indefinite weight sgn x. To this expression there is naturally a self-adjoint operator in some Krein space associated. We characterize the local definitizability of this operator in a neighbourhood of \infty. Moreover, in this situation, the point \infty is a regular critical point. We construct an operator A=(\sgn x)(-d^2/dx^2+q) with non-real spectrum accumulating to a real point. The obtained results are applied to several classes of Sturm-Liouville operators.
