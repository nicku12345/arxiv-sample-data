We consider Schr\"odinger operators H=- \d^2/\d r^2+V on L^2([0,\infty)) with the Dirichlet boundary condition. The potential V may be local or non-local, with polynomial decay at infinity. The point zero in the spectrum of H is classified, and asymptotic expansions of the resolvent around zero are obtained, with explicit expressions for the leading coefficients. These results are applied to the perturbation of an eigenvalue embedded at zero, and the corresponding modified form of the Fermi golden rule.
