Let \Omega be a domain in \mathbb{R}^d, d\geq 2, and 1<p<\infty. Fix V\in L_{\mathrm{loc}}^\infty(\Omega). Consider the functional Q and its G\^{a}teaux derivative Q^\prime given by   Q(u):=\frac{1}{p}\int_\Omega (|\nabla u|^p+V|u|^p)\dx,   Q^\prime (u):=-\nabla\cdot(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)+V|u|^{p-2}u.   It is assumed that Q\geq 0 on C_0^\infty(\Omega). In a previous paper we discussed relations between the absence of weak coercivity of the functional Q on C_0^\infty(\Omega) and the existence of a generalized ground state. In the present paper we study further relationships between functional-analytic properties of the functional Q and properties of positive solutions of the equation Q^\prime (u)=0.
