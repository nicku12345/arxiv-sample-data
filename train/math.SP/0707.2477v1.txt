We study the L^p-spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on certain complete locally symmetric spaces M=\Gamma\backslash X with finite volume and arithmetic fundamental group \Gamma whose universal covering X is a symmetric space of non-compact type. We also show, how the obtained results for locally symmetric spaces can be generalized to manifolds with cusps of rank one.
