We prove a general result on equality of the weak limits of the zero counting measure, d\nu_n, of orthogonal polynomials (defined by a measure d\mu) and \frac{1}{n} K_n(x,x) d\mu(x). By combining this with Mate--Nevai and Totik upper bounds on n\lambda_n(x), we prove some general results on \int_I \frac{1}{n} K_n(x,x) d\mu_s\to 0 for the singular part of d\mu and \int_I |\rho_E(x) - \frac{w(x)}{n} K_n(x,x)| dx\to 0, where \rho_E is the density of the equilibrium measure and w(x) the density of d\mu.
