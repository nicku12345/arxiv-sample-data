Asymptotic behaviors of zero modes of the massless Dirac operator H=\alpha\cdot D + Q(x) are discussed, where   \alpha= (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3) is the triple of 4 \times 4 Dirac matrices,  D=\frac{1}{i} \nabla_x, and Q(x)=\big(q_{jk} (x) \big) is a 4\times 4 Hermitian matrix-valued function with   | q_{jk}(x) | \le C < x >^{-\rho} , \rho >1.   We shall show that for every zero mode f, the asymptotic limit of |x|^2f(x) as |x| \to +\infty exists. The limit is expressed in terms of an integral of Q(x)f(x).
