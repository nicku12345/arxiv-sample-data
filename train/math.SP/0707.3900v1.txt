We consider the Schr\"odinger operator with a periodic potential on quasi-1D models of armchair single-wall nanotubes. The spectrum of this operator consists of an absolutely continuous part (intervals separated by gaps) plus an infinite number of eigenvalues with infinite multiplicity. We describe the absolutely continuous spectrum of the Schr\"odinger operator: 1) the multiplicity, 2) endpoints of the gaps, they are given by periodic or antiperiodic eigenvalues or resonances (branch points of the Lyapunov function), 3) resonance gaps, where the Lyapunov function is non-real. We determine the asymptotics of the gaps at high energy.
