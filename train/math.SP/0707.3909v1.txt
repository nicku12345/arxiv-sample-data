We consider the Schr\"odinger operator with a periodic potential on quasi-1D models of armchair single-wall nanotubes. The spectrum of this operator consists of an absolutely continuous part (intervals separated by gaps) plus an infinite number of eigenvalues with infinite multiplicity. We describe all eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue. We define a Lyapunov function, which is analytic on some Riemann surface. On each sheet, the Lyapunov function has the same properties as in the scalar case, but it has branch points, which we call resonances. In example we show the existence of real and complex resonances for some specific potentials.
