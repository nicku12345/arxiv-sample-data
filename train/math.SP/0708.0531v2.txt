We prove the uniqueness of a translation invariant extension to non integer order classical symbols of the ordinary discrete sum on L^1-symbols, which we then describe using an Hadamard finite part procedure for sums over integer points of infinite unions of nested convex polytopes in \R^d. This canonical regularised sum is the building block to construct meromorphic extensions of the ordinary sum on holomorphic symbols. Explicit formulae for the complex residues at their poles are given in terms of noncommutative residues of classical symbols, thus extending results of Guillemin, Sternberg and Weitsman. These formulae are then applied to zeta functions associated with quadratic forms and with Laplacians on tori.
