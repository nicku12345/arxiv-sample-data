Egorov's theorem for transversally elliptic operators, acting on sections of a vector bundle over a compact foliated manifold, is proved. This theorem relates the quantum evolution of transverse pseudodifferential operators determined by a first order transversally elliptic operator with the (classical) evolution of its symbols determined by the parallel transport along the orbits of the associated transverse bicharacteristic flow. For a particular case of a transverse Dirac operator, the transverse bicharacteristic flow is shown to be given by the transverse geodesic flow and the parallel transport by the parallel transport determined by the transverse Levi-Civita connection. These results allow us to describe the noncommutative geodesic flow in noncommutative geometry of Riemannian foliations.
