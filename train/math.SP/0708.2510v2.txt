We consider "forward-backward" parabolic equations in the abstract form Jd \psi / d x + L \psi = 0,  0< x < \tau \leq \infty, where J and L are operators in a Hilbert space H such that J=J^*=J^{-1}, L=L^* \geq 0, and \ker L = 0. The following theorem is proved: if the operator B=JL is similar to a self-adjoint operator, then associated half-range boundary problems have unique solutions. We apply this theorem to corresponding nonhomogeneous equations, to the time-independent Fokker-Plank equation  \mu \frac {\partial \psi}{\partial x} (x,\mu) = b(\mu) \frac {\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \mu^2} (x, \mu),  0<x<\tau,  \mu \in \R, as well as to other parabolic equations of the "forward-backward" type. The abstract kinetic equation  T d \psi/dx = - A \psi (x) + f(x), where T=T^* is injective and A satisfies a certain positivity assumption, is considered also.
