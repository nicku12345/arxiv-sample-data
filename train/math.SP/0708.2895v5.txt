Let \a be a complex random variable with mean zero and bounded variance \sigma^{2}. Let N_{n} be a random matrix of order n with entries being i.i.d. copies of \a. Let \lambda_{1}, ..., \lambda_{n} be the eigenvalues of \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt n}N_{n}. Define the empirical spectral distribution \mu_{n} of N_{n} by the formula  \mu_n(s,t) := \frac{1}{n} # \{k \leq n| \Re(\lambda_k) \leq s; \Im(\lambda_k) \leq t \}.   The Circular law conjecture asserts that \mu_{n} converges to the uniform distribution \mu_\infty over the unit disk as n tends to infinity.   We prove this conjecture under the slightly stronger assumption that the (2+\eta)\th-moment of \a is bounded, for any \eta >0. Our method builds and improves upon earlier work of Girko, Bai, G\"otze-Tikhomirov, and Pan-Zhou, and also applies for sparse random matrices.   The new key ingredient in the paper is a general result about the least singular value of random matrices, which was obtained using tools and ideas from additive combinatorics.
