For a unitary local system of rank one on a complete hyperbolic threefold of finite volume which has only one cusp, we will compare the order of the Alexander invariant at t=1 and one of Ruelle-Selberg L-function at s=0. Our result may be considered as a geometric analog of the Iwasawa main conjecture in the algebraic number theory.
