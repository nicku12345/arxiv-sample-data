We characterize the space of the so-called planar mixed automorphic forms of type (\nu,\mu) with respect to an equivariant pair (\rho,\tau) as the image of the usual automorphic forms by an appropriate transform and we investigate some concrete basic spectral properties of a magnetic Schrodinger operator acting on them. The associated polynomials constitute classes of generalized complex polynomials of Hermite type.
