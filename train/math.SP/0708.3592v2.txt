In a recent work, \cite{cgss}, we developed a functional calculus for bounded operators defined on quaternionic Banach spaces. In this paper we show how the results from \cite{cgss} can be extended to the unbounded case, and we highlight the crucial differences between the two cases. In particular, we deduce a new eigenvalue equation, suitable for the construction of a functional calculus for operators whose spectrum is not necessarily real.
