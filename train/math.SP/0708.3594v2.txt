In this paper we use the notion of slice monogenic functions \cite{slicecss} to define a new functional calculus for an n-tuple T of not necessarily commuting operators. This calculus is different from the one discussed in \cite{jefferies} and it allows the explicit construction of the eigenvalue equation for the n-tuple T based on a new notion of spectrum for T. Our functional calculus is consistent with the Riesz-Dunford calculus in the case of a single operator.
