In a recent manuscript, D.Vogan conjectures that four canonical globalizations of Harish-Chandra modules commute with certain n-cohomology groups. In this article we prove that Vogan's conjecture holds for one of the globalizations if and only if it holds for the dual. Using a previously published result of one of the authors, which establishes the conjecture for the minimal globalization, we can therefore deduce Vogan's conjecture for the maximal globalization.
