The aim of the paper is to obtain a description of the selfadjoint subspace of the one-speed Boltzmann operator. It is proved that this subspace is nontrivial if the collision integral is polynomial and the multiplication coefficient has a lattice of gaps. A similar result is shown to hold for the 3-dimensional transport operator.   Keywords: completely nonselfadjoint, Boltzmann operator, uncertainly principle.
