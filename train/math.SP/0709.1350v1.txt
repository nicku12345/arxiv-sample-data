We study conical square function estimates for Banach-valued functions, and introduce a vector-valued analogue of the Coifman-Meyer-Stein tent spaces. Following recent work of Auscher-McIntosh-Russ, the tent spaces in turn are used to construct a scale of vector-valued Hardy spaces associated with a given bisectorial operator (A) with certain off-diagonal bounds, such that (A) always has a bounded (H^{\infty})-functional calculus on these spaces. This provides a new way of proving functional calculus of (A) on the Bochner spaces (L^p(\R^n;X)) by checking appropriate conical square function estimates, and also a conical analogue of Bourgain's extension of the Littlewood-Paley theory to the UMD-valued context. Even when (X=\C), our approach gives refined (p)-dependent versions of known results.
