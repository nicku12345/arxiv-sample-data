In [3] the authors studied the 4-parameter family of isospectral flat 4-tori T^\pm(a,b,c,d) discovered by Conway and Sloane. With a particular method of counting nodal domains they were able to distinguish these tori (numerically) by computing the corresponding nodal sequences relative to a few explicit tuples (a,b,c,d). In this note we confirm the expectation expressed in [3] by proving analytically that their nodal count distinguishes any 4-tuple of distinct positive real numbers.
