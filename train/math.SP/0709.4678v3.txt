We equip the polytope of n\times n Markov matrices with the normalized trace of the Lebesgue measure of \mathbb{R}^{n^2}. This probability space provides random Markov matrices, with i.i.d. rows following the Dirichlet distribution of mean (1/n,...,1/n). We show that if \bM is such a random matrix, then the empirical distribution built from the singular values of\sqrt{n} \bM tends as n\to\infty to a Wigner quarter--circle distribution. Some computer simulations reveal striking asymptotic spectral properties of such random matrices, still waiting for a rigorous mathematical analysis. In particular, we believe that with probability one, the empirical distribution of the complex spectrum of \sqrt{n} \bM tends as n\to\infty to the uniform distribution on the unit disc of the complex plane, and that moreover, the spectral gap of \bM is of order 1-1/\sqrt{n} when n is large.
