Let G\subset \O(n) be a compact group of isometries acting on n-dimensional Euclidean space \R^n, and {\bf{X}} a bounded domain in \R^n which is transformed into itself under the action of G. Consider a symmetric, classical pseudodifferential operator A_0 in \L^2(\R^n) that commutes with the regular representation of G, and assume that it is elliptic on \bf{X}. We show that the spectrum of the Friedrichs extension A of the operator \mathrm{res} \circ A_0 \circ \mathrm{ext}: \CT({\bf{X}}) \to \L^2({\bf{X}}) is discrete, and using the method of the stationary phase, we derive asymptotics for the number N_\chi(\lambda) of eigenvalues of A equal or less than \lambda and with eigenfunctions in the \chi-isotypic component of \L^2({\bf{X}}) as \lambda \to \infty, giving also an estimate for the remainder term for singular group actions. Since the considered critical set is a singular variety, we recur to partial desingularization in order to apply the stationary phase theorem.
