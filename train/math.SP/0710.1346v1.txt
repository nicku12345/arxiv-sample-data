We consider n\times n real symmetric and hermitian random matrices H_{n,m} equals the sum of a non-random matrix H_{n}^{(0)} matrix and the sum of m rank-one matrices determined by m i.i.d. isotropic random vectors with log-concave probability law and i.i.d. random amplitudes \{\tau_{\alpha }\}_{\alpha =1}^{m}. This is a generalization of the case of vectors uniformly distributed over the unit sphere, studied in [Marchenko-Pastur (1967)]. We prove that if n\to \infty, m\to \infty, m/n\to c\in \lbrack 0,\infty) and that the empirical eigenvalue measure of H_{n}^{(0)} converges weakly, then the empirical eigenvalue measure of H_{n,m} converges in probability to a non-random limit, found in [Marchenko-Pastur (1967)].
