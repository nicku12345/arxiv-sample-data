One approach to multivariate operator theory involves concepts and techniques from algebraic and complex geometry and is formulated in terms of Hilbert modules. In these notes we provide an introduction to this approach including many proofs. We are particularly interested in examples related to hermitian holomorphic vector bundles and we study submodules and reducing submodules in such cases. We go into some detail concerning a problem of Zhu on the reducing subspaces of powers of the Bergman shift as well as more recent work of the author and J. Sarkar on proper submodules which are unitarily equivalent to the orginal. Although the basic results are not new, there is some novelty in the details and the organization of the material.
