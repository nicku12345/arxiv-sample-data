Let (G_\epsilon)_{\epsilon>0} be a family of '\epsilon-thin' Riemannian manifolds modeled on a finite metric graph G, for example, the \epsilon-neighborhood of an embedding of G in some Euclidean space with straight edges. We study the asymptotic behavior of the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on G_\epsilon as \epsilon\to 0, for various boundary conditions. We obtain complete asymptotic expansions for the kth eigenvalue and the eigenfunctions, uniformly for k\leq C\epsilon^{-1}, in terms of scattering data on a non-compact limit space. We then use this to determine the quantum graph which is to be regarded as the limit object, in a spectral sense, of the family (G_\epsilon).   Our method is a direct construction of approximate eigenfunctions from the scattering and graph data, and use of a priori estimates to show that all eigenfunctions are obtained in this way.
