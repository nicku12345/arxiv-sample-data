For a conformally compact manifold that is hyperbolic near infinity and of dimension n+1, we complete the proof of the optimal O(r^{n+1}) upper bound on the resonance counting function, correcting a mistake in the existing literature. In the case of a compactly supported perturbation of a hyperbolic manifold, we establish a Poisson formula expressing the regularized wave trace as a sum over scattering resonances. This leads to an r^{n+1} lower bound on the counting function for scattering poles.
