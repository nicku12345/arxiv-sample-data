The main result includes features of a Hardy-type inequality and an inequality of either Sobolev or Gagliardo-Nirenberg type. It is inspired by the method of proof of a recent improved Sobolev inequality derived by M. Ledoux which brings out the connection between Sobolev embeddings and heat kernel bounds. Here Ledoux's technique is applied to the operator L:= {\bf{x}} \cdot \nabla and the analysis requires the determination of the operator semigroup \{e^{-tL^{*}L}\}_{t>0} and its properties.
