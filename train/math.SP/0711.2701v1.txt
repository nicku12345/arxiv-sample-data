We relate asymptotics of Jacobi parameters to asymptotics of the spectral weights near the edges. Typical of our results is that for a_n\equiv 1, b_n =-C n^{-\beta} (0<\beta< \frac23), one has d\mu(x)= w(x) dx on (-2,2), and near x=2, w(x)=e^{-2Q(x)} where \[ Q(x)=\beta^{-1} C^{\frac{1}{\beta}} \frac{\Gamma(\frac32)\Gamma(\frac{1}\beta}-\frac12)(2-x)^{\frac12 -\frac{1}{\beta}}}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{\beta}+1)}(1+O((2-x))) \]
