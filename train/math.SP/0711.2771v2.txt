We study the question of the existence of a dual extremal function for a bounded matrix function on the unit circle in connection with the problem of approximation by analytic matrix functions. We characterize the class of matrix functions, for which a dual extremal function exists in terms of the existence of a maximizing vector of the corresponding Hankel operator and in terms of certain special factorizations that involve thematic matrix functions.
