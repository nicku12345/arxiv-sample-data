A unitary family is a family of unitary operators U(x) acting on a finite dimensional hermitian vector space, depending analytically on a real parameter x. It is monotone if \frac1i U'(x)U(x)^{-1} is a positive operator for each x. We prove a number of results generalizing standard theorems on the spectral theory of a single unitary operator U_0, which correspond to the 'commutative' case U(x)=e^{ix}U_0. Also, for a two-parameter unitary family -- for which there is no analytic perturbation theory -- we prove an implicit function type theorem for the spectral data under the assumption that the family is monotone in one argument.
