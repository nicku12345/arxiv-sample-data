Given a (k+1)-tuple A, B_1,...,B_k of (m\times n)-matrices with m\le n we call the set of all k-tuples of complex numbers \{\la_1,...,\la_k\} such that the linear combination A+\la_1B_1+\la_2B_2+...+\la_kB_k has rank smaller than m the {\it eigenvalue locus} of the latter pencil. Motivated primarily by applications to multi-parameter generalizations of the Heine-Stieltjes spectral problem, see \cite{He} and \cite{Vol}, we study a number of properties of the eigenvalue locus in the most important case k=n-m+1.
