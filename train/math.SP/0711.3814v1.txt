In this paper, new methods for smoothing gamma-ray spectra measured by NaI detector are derived. Least squares fitting method with B-spline basis functions is used to reduce the influence of statistical fluctuations. The derived procedures are simple and automatic. The results show that this method is better than traditional method with a more complete reduction of staistical fluctuation.
