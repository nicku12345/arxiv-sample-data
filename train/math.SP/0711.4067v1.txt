In this paper, we prove two new Weyl-type upper estimates for the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian. As a consequence, we obtain the following {\em lower} bounds for its counting function. For \la\ge \la_1, one has   N(\la) > \dfrac{2}{n+2} \dfrac{1}{H_n} (\la-\la_1)^{n/2} \la_1^{-n/2},   and   N(\la) > (\dfrac{n+2}{n+4})^{n/2} \dfrac{1}{H_n} (\la-(1+4/n) \la_1)^{n/2} \la_1^{-n/2},   where   H_n=\dfrac{2 n}{j_{n/2-1,1}^2 J_{n/2}^2(j_{n/2-1,1})}   is a constant which depends on n, the dimension of the underlying space, and Bessel functions and their zeros.
