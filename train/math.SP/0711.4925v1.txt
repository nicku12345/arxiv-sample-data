We give an improvement of sharp Berezin type bounds on the Riesz means \sum_k(\Lambda-\lambda_k)_+^\sigma of the eigenvalues \lambda_k of the Dirichlet Laplacian in a domain if \sigma\geq 3/2. It contains a correction term of the order of the standard second term in the Weyl asymptotics. The result is based on an application of sharp Lieb-Thirring inequalities with operator valued potential to spectral estimates of the Dirichlet Laplacian in domains.
