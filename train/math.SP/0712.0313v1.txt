We consider Schr\"odinger operators in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3) with a singular interaction supported by a finite curve \Gamma. We present a proper definition of the operators and study their properties, in particular, we show that the discrete spectrum can be empty if \Gamma is short enough. If it is not the case, we investigate properties of the eigenvalues in the situation when the curve has a hiatus of length 2\epsilon. We derive an asymptotic expansion with the leading term which a multiple of \epsilon \ln\epsilon.
