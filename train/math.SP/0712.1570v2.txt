In this thesis, we analyze the stochastic completeness of a heat kernel on graphs which is a function of three variables: a pair of vertices and a continuous time, for infinite, locally finite, connected graphs. For general graphs, a sufficient condition for stochastic completeness is given in terms of the maximum valence on spheres about a fixed vertex. That this result is optimal is shown by studying a particular family of trees. We also prove a lower bound on the bottom of the spectrum for the discrete Laplacian and use this lower bound to show that in certain cases the Laplacian has empty essential spectrum.
