The paper analyses the decay of any zero modes that might exist for a massless Dirac operator H:= \ba \cdot (1/i) \bgrad + Q,  where Q is 4 \times 4-matrix-valued and of order O(|\x|^{-1}) at infinity. The approach is based on inversion with respect to the unit sphere in \R^3 and establishing embedding theorems for Dirac-Sobolev spaces of spinors f which are such that f and Hf lie in (L^p(\R^3))^4, 1\le p<\infty.
