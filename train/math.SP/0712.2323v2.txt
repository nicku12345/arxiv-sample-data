We consider standard subordinacy theory for general Sturm--Liouville operators and give criteria when boundedness of solutions implies that no subordinate solutions exist. As applications, we prove a Weidmann-type result for general Sturm--Liouville operators and investigate the absolutely continuous spectrum of radially symmetric quantum trees.
