This paper studies the Schr\"odinger operator with Morse potential on a right half line [u, \infty) and determines the Weyl asymptotics of eigenvalues for constant boundary conditions. It obtains information on zeros of the Whittaker function W_{\kappa, \mu}(x) for fixed real parameters \kappa, x, with x positive, viewed as an entire function of the complex variable \mu. In this case all zeros lie on the imaginary axis, with the exception, if k<0, of a finite number of real zeros. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of zeros of modulus at most T of form N(T) = (2/\pi) T \log T + f(u) T + O(1). Some parallels are noted with zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
