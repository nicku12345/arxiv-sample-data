This article gives a description of invariant subspaces for the backward shift generated by vector valued lacunary series and by a class of lacunary power series in H^2(\mathbb{D}, X), (where X is an Hilbert space). In particular, we show that these series f in H^2(\mathbb{D}, X) are cyclic vectors if and only if the queue of Taylor coefficients \{\hat{f}(k), k>N\} generates the whole space X. Analogues of this result are obtained for some functions whose spectrum is a finite union of lacunary sequences and in the polydisc. In the scalar case H^2, we give a criterion on the Fourier spectrum of the function to have cyclicity for any power of the backward shift.
