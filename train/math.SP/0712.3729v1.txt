Passive systems \tau={T,M,N,H} with M and N as an input and output space and H as a state space are considered in the case that the main operator on the state space is normal. Basic properties are given and a general unitary similarity result involving some spectral theoretic conditions on the main operator is established. A passive system \tau with M=N is said to be quasi-selfadjoint if ran(T-T^*)\subset N. The subclass S^{qs} of the Schur class S is the class formed by all transfer functions of quasi-selfadjoint passive systems. The subclass S^{qs} is characterized and minimal passive quasi-selfadjoint realizations are studied. The connection between the transfer function belonging to the subclass S^{qs} and the Q-function of T is given.
