We consider an eigenvalue problem for a divergence form elliptic operator A_\epsilon with high contrast periodic coefficients with period \epsilon in each coordinate, where \epsilon is a small parameter. The coefficients are perturbed on a bounded domain of `order one' size. The local perturbation of coefficients for such operator could result in emergence of localized waves - eigenfunctions with corresponding eigenvalues lying in the gaps of the Floquet-Bloch spectrum. We prove that, for the so-called double porosity type scaling, the eigenfunctions decay exponentially at infinity, uniformly in \epsilon. Then, using the tools of two-scale convergence for high contrast homogenization, we prove the strong two-scale compactness of the eigenfunctions of A_\epsilon. This implies that the eigenfunctions converge in the sense of the strong two-scale convergence to the eigenfunctions of a two-scale limit homogenized operator A_0, consequently establishing `asymptotic one-to-one correspondence' between the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of these two operators. We also prove by direct means the stability of the essential spectrum of the homogenized operator with respect to the local perturbation of its coefficients. That allows us to establish not only the strong two-scale resolvent convergence of A_\epsilon to A_0 but also the Hausdorff convergence of the spectra of A_\epsilon to the spectrum of A_0, preserving the multiplicity of the isolated eigenvalues.
