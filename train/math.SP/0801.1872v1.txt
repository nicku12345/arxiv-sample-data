Rods are parts of various devices. If it is impossible to observe the rod directly, the only source of information about possible defects of its fastening can be the natural frequencies of its flexural vibrations. The question arises whether one would be able to detect damage in rod fastening by the natural frequencies of its flexural vibrations. This paper gives and substantiates a positive answer to this question.
