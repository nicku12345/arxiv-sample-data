In this paper we study a Sturm--Liouville operator Ly=-y''+q(x)y in the space L_2[0,\pi] with Direchlet boundary conditions. Here the potential q is a fitst order distribution q\in W_2^{-1}[0,\pi]. Such operators were defined in our previous papers. Here we study an asymptotic behaviour of eigenfunctions with uniform estimates of rests. We obtain this estimates also for potentials from Sobolev spaces q\in W_2^{\theta-1}, where \theta\in[0,1/2).
