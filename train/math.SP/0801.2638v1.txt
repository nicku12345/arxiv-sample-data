We define a new differential invariant a compact manifold by V_{\mathcal M}(M)=\inf_g V_c(M,[g]), where V_c(M,[g]) is the conformal volume of M for the conformal class [g], and prove that it is uniformly bounded above. The main motivation is that this bound provides a upper bound of the Friedlander-Nadirashvili invariant defined by \inf_g\sup_{\tilde g\in[g]}\lambda_1(M,\tilde g)\Vol(M,\tilde g)^{\frac 2n}.   The proof relies on the study of the behaviour of V_{\mathcal M}(M) when one performs surgeries on M.
