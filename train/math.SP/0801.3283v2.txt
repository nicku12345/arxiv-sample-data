In this article we improve some of the inverse spectral results proved by Guillemin and Uribe in \cite{GU}. They proved that under some symmetry assumptions on the potential V(x), the Taylor expansion of V(x) near a non-degenerate global minimum can be recovered from the knowledge of the low-lying eigenvalues of the associated Schr\"odinger operator in \mathbb R^n. We prove some similar inverse spectral results using fewer symmetry assumptions. We also show that in dimension 1, no symmetry assumption is needed to recover the Taylor coefficients of V(x). We establish our results by finding some explicit formulas for wave invariants at the bottom of the well.
