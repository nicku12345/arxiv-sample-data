Parameter-ellipticity with respect to a closed subsector of the complex plane for pseudodifferential Douglis-Nirenberg systems is discussed and shown to imply the existence of a bounded H_\infty-calculus in suitable scales of Sobolev, Besov, and Hoelder spaces. We also admit non pseudodifferential perturbations. Applications concern systems with coefficients of mild Hoelder regularity and the generalized thermoelastic plate equations.
