Let A be an elliptic operator on a compact manifold with boundary M, and let \wp : \partial\M \to Y be a covering map, where Y is a closed manifold. Let A_C be a realization of A subject to a coupling condition C that is elliptic with parameter in the sector \Lambda. By a coupling condition we mean a nonlocal boundary condition that respects the covering structure of the boundary.   We prove that the resolvent trace \Tr_{L^2} (A_C-\lambda)^{-N} for N sufficiently large has a complete asymptotic expansion as |\lambda| \to \infty, \lambda \in \Lambda. In particular, the heat trace \Tr_{L^2}e^{-tA_C} has a complete asymptotic expansion as t \to 0^+, and the \zeta-function has a meromorphic extension to \C.
