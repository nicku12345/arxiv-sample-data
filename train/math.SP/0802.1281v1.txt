Applying perturbation theory methods, the absence of the point spectrum for some nonselfadjoint integro-differential operators is investigated. The considered differential operators are of arbitrary order and act in either \mathbf{L}_{p}(\mathbb{R}_{+}) or \mathbf{L}_{p}(\mathbb{R}) (1\leq p<\infty). As an application of general results, new spectral properties of the perturbed Hill operator are derived.
