This paper is the continuation of our work with Victor Guillemin; Victor and I proved that the Taylor expansion of the potential at a generic non degenerate critical point is determined by the semi-classical spectrum of the associated Schr\"odinger operator near the corresponding critical value. Here, I show that, under some genericity assumptions, the potential of the 1D Schroedinger operator is determined by its semi-classical spectrum. Moreover, there is an explicit reconstruction. This paper is strongly related to a paper of David Gurarie (J. Math. Phys. 36:1934--1944 (1995)).
