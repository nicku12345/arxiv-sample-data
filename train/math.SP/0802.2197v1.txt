It is shown that the deviations P_n -P_n^0 of Riesz projections    P_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{C_n} (z-L)^{-1} dz, \quad C_n=\{|z-n^2|= n\},  of Hill operators L y = - y^{\prime \prime} + v(x) y, x \in [0,\pi], with zero and H^{-1} periodic potentials go to zero as n \to \infty  even if we consider P_n -P_n^0 as operators from L^1 to L^\infty.  This implies that all L^p-norms are uniformly equivalent on the Riesz subspaces Ran P_n.
