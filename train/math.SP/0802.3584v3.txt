In this work we continue the study of the Weyl asymptotics of the distribution of eigenvalues of non-self-adjoint (pseudo)differential operators with small random perturbations, by treating the case of multiplicative perturbations in arbitrary dimension. We were led to quite essential improvements of many of the probabilistic aspects.
