Using a combination of Kawashima- and Goodman-type energy estimates, we establish spectral stability of general small-amplitude relaxation shocks of symmetric dissipative systems. This extends previous results obtained by Plaza and Zumbrun by singular perturbation techniques under an additional technical assumption, namely, that the background equation be noncharacteristic with respect to the shock.
