Sufficient conditions for the similarity of the operator A := 1/r(x) (-d^2/dx^2 +q(x)) with an indefinite weight r(x)=(\sgn x)|r(x)| are obtained. These conditions are formulated in terms of Titchmarsh-Weyl m-coefficients. Sufficient conditions for the regularity of the critical points 0 and \infty of J-nonnegative Sturm-Liouville operators are also obtained. This result is exploited to prove the regularity of 0 for various classes of Sturm-Liouville operators. This implies the similarity of the considered operators to self-adjoint ones. In particular, in the case r(x)=\sgn x and q\in L^1(R, (1+|x|)dx), we prove that A is similar to a self-adjoint operator if and only if A is J-nonnegative. The latter condition on q is sharp, i.e., we construct q\in \cap_{\gamma <1} L^1(R, (1+|x|)^\gamma dx) such that A is J-nonnegative with the singular critical point 0. Hence A is not similar to a self-adjoint operator. For periodic and infinite-zone potentials, we show that J-positivity is sufficient for the similarity of A to a self-adjoint operator. In the case q\equiv 0, we prove the regularity of the critical point 0 for a wide class of weights r. This yields new results for "forward-backward" diffusion equations.
