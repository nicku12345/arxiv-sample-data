For a nonnegative self-adjoint operator A_0 acting on a Hilbert space \mathfrak{H} singular perturbations of the form A_0+V, \ V=\sum_{1}^{n}{b}_{ij}<\psi_j,\cdot>\psi_i are studied under some additional requirements of symmetry imposed on the initial operator A_0 and the singular elements \psi_j. A concept of symmetry is defined by means of a one-parameter family of unitary operators \sU that is motivated by results due to R. S. Phillips. The abstract framework to study singular perturbations with symmetries developed in the paper allows one to incorporate physically meaningful connections between singular potentials V and the corresponding self-adjoint realizations of A_0+V. The results are applied for the investigation of singular perturbations of the Schr\"{o}dinger operator in L_2(\dR^3) and for the study of a (fractional) \textsf{p}-adic Schr\"{o}dinger type operator with point interactions.
