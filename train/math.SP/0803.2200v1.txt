We consider the periodic Zakharov-Shabat operators on the real line. The spectrum of this operator consists of intervals separated by gaps with the lengths |g_n|\ge 0, n\in \Z. Let \m_n^\pm be the corresponding effective masses and let h_n be heights of the corresponding slits in the quasimomentum domain. We obtain a priori estimates of sequences g=(|g_n|)_{n\in \Z},\m^\pm=(\m_n^\pm)_{n\in \Z}, h=(h_n)_{n\in \Z} in terms of weighted \ell^p-norms at p\ge 1. The proof is based on the analysis of the quasimomentum as the conformal mapping.
