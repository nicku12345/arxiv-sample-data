A simplified model in superconductivity theory studied by P. Krotkov and A. Chubukov \cite{KC1,KC2} led to an integral operator K -- see (1), (2). They guessed that the equation E_0(a,T)=1 where E_0 is the largest eigenvalue of the operator K has a solution T(a)=1-\tau(a) with \tau (a) \sim a^{2/5} when a goes to 0. \tau(a) imitates the shift of critical (instability) temperature. We give a rigorous analysis of an anisotropic integral operator K and prove the asymptotic (*) -- see Theorem 8 and Proposition 10. Additive Uncertainty Principle (of Landau-Pollack-Slepian [SP], \cite{LP1,LP2}) plays important role in this analysis.
