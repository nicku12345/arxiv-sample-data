We consider a Sturm--Liouville operator Ly=-y''+qy in L_2[0,\pi] with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We assume, that the potential q is complex valued and belongs to Sobolev space W_2^\theta[0,\pi], \theta\in(-1,-1/2. This operators were successfully defined in papers of Savchuk A.M. and Shkalikov A.A. There were also shown, that theese operators have a discrete spectrum, which we denote by \{\lambda_n\}, and \lim\lambda_n=+\infty. All but finitely many of them are simple. The eigenfunctions form the Riesz basis in L_2[0,\pi]. We investigate a uniform on [0,\pi] equiconvergence of series for this system and for trigonometric system \{\sin(nt)\}_1^\infty. We obtain not only a theorems of equiconvergence, but also estimate a rate of this equiconvergence.
