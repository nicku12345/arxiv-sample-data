The Hill operators L y = - y^{\prime \prime} + v(x) y, x \in [0,\pi], with H^{-1} periodic potentials, considered with periodic, antiperiodic or Dirichlet boundary conditions, have discrete spectrum, and therefore, for sufficiently large N, the Riesz projections    P_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{C_n} (z-L)^{-1} dz, \quad C_n=\{z: |z-n^2|= n\}  are well defined. It is proved that \sum_{n>N} \|P_n - P_n^0\|^2_{HS} < \infty,  where P_n^0 are the Riesz projection of the free operator and \|\cdot\|_{HS} is the Hilbert--Schmidt norm.
