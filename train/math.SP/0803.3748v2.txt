Let D\subsetneq R^d be an unbounded domain and let B(t) be a Brownian motion in D with normal reflection at the boundary. We study the transcience/recurrence dichotomy, focusing mainly on domains of the form D=\{(x,z)\in R^{l+m}:|z|<H(|x|)\}, where d=l+m and H is a sufficiently regular function. This class of domains includes various horn-shaped domains and generalized slab domains.
