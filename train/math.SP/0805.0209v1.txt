It is shown that the joint spectral radius \rho(M) of a precompact family M of operators on a Banach space X is equal to the maximum of two numbers: the joint spectral radius \rho_{e}(M) of the image of M in the Calkin algebra and the Berger-Wang radius r(M) defined by the formula \[ r(M)=\underset{n\to\infty}{\limsup}(\sup\left\{\rho(a):a\in M^{n}\right\} ^{1/n}) . \] Some more general Banach-algebraic results of this kind are also proved. The proofs are based on the study of special radicals on the class of Banach algebras.
