In this paper, for d > 2, we prove the absolute continuity of the spectrum of a d-dimensional periodic Dirac operator with some discontinuous magnetic and electric potentials. In particular, for d = 3, electric potentials from Zygmund classes L^3\ln ^{1+\delta}L(K), \delta >0, and also ones with Coulomb singularities, with constraints on charges depending on the magnetic potential, are admitted (here K is the fundamental domain of the period lattice).
