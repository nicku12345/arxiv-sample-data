We study the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators  S(q)u:=-u"+q(x)u,\quad u\in \mathrm{Dom}\left(S(q)\right),  with 1-periodic real-valued singular potentials q(x)\in H_{\operatorname{per}}^{-1}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}) on the Hilbert space L_{2}\left(\mathbb{R}\right). We show equivalence of five basic definitions of the operators S(q) and prove that they are self-adjoint. A new proof of continuity of the spectrum of the operators S(q) is found. Endpoints of spectrum gaps are precisely described.
