The behaviour of the lengths of spectral gaps \{\gamma_{n}(q)\}_{n=1}^{\infty} of the Hill-Schr\"odinger operators   S(q)u=-u''+q(x)u,\quad u\in \mathrm{Dom}(S(q)) with real-valued 1-periodic distributional potentials q(x)\in H_{1{-}per}^{-1}(\mathbb{R}) is studied. We show that they exhibit the same behaviour as the Fourier coefficients \{\widehat{q}(n)\}_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} of the potentials q(x) with respect to the weighted sequence spaces h^{s,\varphi}, s>-1, \varphi\in \mathrm{SV}. The case q(x)\in L_{1{-}per}^{2}(\mathbb{R}), s\in \mathbb{Z}_{+}, \varphi\equiv 1 corresponds to the Marchenko-Ostrovskii Theorem.
