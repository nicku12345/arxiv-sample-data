We consider the trace map associated with the Fibonacci Hamiltonian as a diffeomorphism on the invariant surface associated with a given coupling constant and prove that the non-wandering set of this map is hyperbolic if the coupling is sufficiently small. As a consequence, for these values of the coupling constant, the local and global Hausdorff dimension and the local and global box counting dimension of the spectrum of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian all coincide and are smooth functions of the coupling constant.
