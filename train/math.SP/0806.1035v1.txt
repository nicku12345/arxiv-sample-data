We investigate the spectral properties of the time-dependent linear transport equation with bounce-back boundary conditions. A fine analysis of the spectrum of the streaming operator is given and the explicit expression of the strongly continuous streaming semigroup is derived. Next, making use of a recent result from M. Sbihi \cite{Sbihi}, we prove, via a compactness argument, that the essential spectrum of the transport semigroup and that of the streaming semigroup coincide on all L^p-spaces with 1<p<\infty.
