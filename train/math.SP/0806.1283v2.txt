A special class of generalized Jacobi operators which are self-adjoint in Krein spaces is presented. A description of the resolvent set of such operators in terms of solutions of the corresponding recurrence relations is given. In particular, special attention is paid to the periodic generalized Jacobi operators. Finally, the spectral properties of generalized Jacobi operators are applied to prove convergence results for Pad\'e approximants.
