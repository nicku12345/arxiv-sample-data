We consider a Sturm--Liouville Ly=-y''+q(x)y in space L_2[0,\pi] with potential from Sobolev space W_2^{-1}[0,\pi]. Moreover, we assume, that q=u', where u\in L_2[0,\pi]. We consider Direchlet boundary conditions y(0)=y(\pi)=0, although we can treat a boundary conditions of Sturm type. It is known, that operators of such class have a discrete spectr with only accumulation point +\infty and the system \{y_k\}_1^\infty of eigen and associated functions is a Riesz basis in L_2[0,\pi]. Moreover, this basis is a Hilbert--Schmidt perturbation of the basis \{sin(kx)\}_1^\infty. In this paper we prove the uniconvergence theorem: for any element f\in L_2[0,\pi] the sequence P_nf-S_nf\to0 as n\to\infty in C[0,\pi] (here P_n and S_n are the Riesz projectors to \{y_k\}_1^n and \{\sin(kt)\}_1^n respectively).
