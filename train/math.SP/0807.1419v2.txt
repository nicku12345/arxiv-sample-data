We study Schr\"odinger operators on an infinite quantum graph of a chain form which consists of identical rings connected at the touching points by \delta-couplings with a parameter \alpha\in\R. If the graph is "straight", i.e. periodic with respect to ring shifts, its Hamiltonian has a band spectrum with all the gaps open whenever \alpha\ne 0. We consider a "bending" deformation of the chain consisting of changing one position at a single ring and show that it gives rise to eigenvalues in the open spectral gaps. We analyze dependence of these eigenvalues on the coupling \alpha and the "bending angle" as well as resonances of the system coming from the bending. We also discuss the behaviour of the eigenvalues and resonances at the edges of the spectral bands.
