We exhibit a dense set of limit periodic potentials for which the corresponding one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator has a positive Lyapunov exponent for all energies and a spectrum of zero Lebesgue measure. No example with those properties was previously known, even in the larger class of ergodic potentials. We also conclude that the generic limit periodic potential has a spectrum of zero Lebesgue measure.
