The diffusion operator  H_D=-\frac12\frac d{dx}a\frac d{dx}-b\frac d{dx}=-\frac12\exp(-2B)\frac d{dx}a\exp(2B)\frac d{dx},  where B(x)=\int_0^x\frac ba(y)dy, defined either on R^+=(0,\infty) with the Dirichlet boundary condition at x=0, or on R, can be realized as a self-adjoint operator with respect to the density \exp(2Q(x))dx. The operator is unitarily equivalent to the Schr\"odinger-type operator H_S=-\frac12\frac d{dx}a\frac d{dx}+V_{b,a}, where V_{b,a}=\frac12(\frac{b^2}a+b'). We obtain an explicit criterion for the existence of a compact resolvent and explicit formulas up to the multiplicative constant 4 for the infimum of the spectrum and for the infimum of the essential spectrum for these operators. We give some applications which show in particular how \inf\sigma(H_D) scales when a=\nu a_0 and b=\gamma b_0, where \nu and \gamma are parameters, and a_0 and b_0 are chosen from certain classes of functions. We also give applications to self-adjoint, multi-dimensional diffusion operators.
