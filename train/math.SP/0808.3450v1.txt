Generalized eigenfunctions of the two-dimensional relativistic Schr\"odinger operator H=\sqrt{-\Delta}+V(x) with |V(x)|\leq C< x>^{-\sigma}, \sigma>3/2, are considered. We compute the integral kernels of the boundary values R_0^\pm(\lambda)=(\sqrt{-\Delta}-(\lambda\pm i0))^{-1}, and prove that the generalized eigenfunctions \phi^\pm(x,k) are bounded on R_x^2\times\{k | a\leq |k|\leq b\}, where [a,b]\subset(0,\infty)\backslash\sigma_p(H), and \sigma_p(H) is the set of eigenvalues of H. With this fact and the completeness of the wave operators, we establish the eigenfunction expansion for the absolutely continuous subspace for H. Finally, we show that each generalized eigenfunction is asymptotically equal to a sum of a plane wave and a spherical wave under the assumption that \sigma>2.
