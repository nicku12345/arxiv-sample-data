In the setting of adjoint pairs of operators we consider the question: to what extent does the Weyl M-function see the same singularities as the resolvent of a certain restriction A_B of the maximal operator? We obtain results showing that it is possible to describe explicitly certain spaces \Sc and \tilde{\Sc} such that the resolvent bordered by projections onto these subspaces is analytic everywhere that the M-function is analytic. We present three examples -- one involving a Hain-L\"{u}st type operator, one involving a perturbed Friedrichs operator and one involving a simple ordinary differential operators on a half line -- which together indicate that the abstract results are probably best possible.
