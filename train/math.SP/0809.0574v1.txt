Originally motivated by a stability problem in Fluid Mechanics, we study the spectral and pseudospectral properties of the differential operator H_\epsilon = -\partial_x^2 + x^2 + i\epsilon^{-1}f(x) on L^2(R), where f is a real-valued function and \epsilon > 0 a small parameter. We define \Sigma(\epsilon) as the infimum of the real part of the spectrum of H_\epsilon, and \Psi(\epsilon)^{-1} as the supremum of the norm of the resolvent of H_\epsilon along the imaginary axis. Under appropriate conditions on f, we show that both quantities \Sigma(\epsilon), \Psi(\epsilon) go to infinity as \epsilon \to 0, and we give precise estimates of the growth rate of \Psi(\epsilon). We also provide an example where \Sigma(\epsilon) is much larger than \Psi(\epsilon) if \epsilon is small. Our main results are established using variational "hypocoercive" methods, localization techniques and semiclassical subelliptic estimates.
