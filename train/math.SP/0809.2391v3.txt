Convergence of diagonal Pad\'e approximants is studied for a class of functions which admit the integral representation  {\mathfrak F}(\lambda)=r_1(\lambda)\int_{-1}^1\frac{td\sigma(t)}{t-\lambda}+r_2(\lambda),  where \sigma is a finite nonnegative measure on [-1,1], r_1, r_2 are real rational functions bounded at \infty, and r_1 is nonnegative for real \lambda. Sufficient conditions for the convergence of a subsequence of diagonal Pad\'e approximants of  {\mathfrak F} on \dR\setminus[-1,1] are found. Moreover, in the case when r_1\equiv 1, r_2\equiv 0 and \sigma has a gap (\alpha,\beta) containing 0, it turns out that this subsequence converges in the gap. The proofs are based on the operator representation of diagonal Pad\'e approximants of  {\mathfrak F} in terms of the so-called generalized Jacobi matrix associated with the asymptotic expansion of  {\mathfrak F} at infinity.
