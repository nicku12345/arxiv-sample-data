In continuation of \cite{HHOT}, we discuss the question of spectral minimal 3-partitions for the rectangle ]-\frac a2,\frac a2[\times ] -\frac b2,\frac b2[ , with 0< a\leq b. It has been observed in \cite{HHOT} that when 0<\frac ab < \sqrt{\frac 38} the minimal 3-partition is obtained by the three nodal domains of the third eigenfunction corresponding to the three rectangles ]-\frac a2,\frac a2[\times ] -\frac b2,-\frac b6[, ]-\frac a2,\frac a2[\times ] -\frac b6,\frac b6[ and ]-\frac a2,\frac a2[\times ] \frac b6, \frac b2[. We will describe a possible mechanism of transition for increasing \frac ab between these nodal minimal 3-partitions and non nodal minimal 3-partitions at the value  \sqrt{\frac 38} and discuss the existence of symmetric candidates for giving minimal 3-partitions when  \sqrt{\frac 38}<\frac ab \leq 1. Numerical analysis leads very naturally to nice questions of isospectrality which are solved by introducing Aharonov-Bohm Hamiltonians or by going on the double covering of the punctured rectangle.
