Arbitrary operator A on a Banach space X which is the generator of C_0-group with certain growth condition at infinity is considered. The relationship between its exponential type entire vectors and its spectral subspaces is found. Inverse theorems on connection between the degree of smoothness of vector x\in X with respect to operator A, the rate of convergence to zero of the best approximation of x by exponential type entire vectors for operator A, and the k-module of continuity are established. Also, a generalization of the Bernstein-type inequality is obtained. The results allow to obtain Bernstein-type inequalities in weighted L_p spaces.
