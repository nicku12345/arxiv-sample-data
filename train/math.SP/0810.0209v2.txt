In this paper we first derive several results concerning the L^p spectrum of arithmetic locally symmetric spaces whose \Q-rank equals one. In particular, we show that there is an open subset of \C consisting of eigenvalues of the L^p Laplacian if p <2 and that corresponding eigenfunctions are given by certain Eisenstein series. On the other hand, if p>2 there is at most a discrete set of real eigenvalues of the L^p Laplacian. These results are used in the second part of this paper in order to show that the dynamics of the L^p heat semigroups for p<2 is very different from the dynamics of the L^p heat semigroups if p\geq 2.
