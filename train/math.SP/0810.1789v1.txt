We consider various closed (and self-adjoint) extensions of elliptic differential expressions of the type \cA=\sum_{0\le |\alpha|,|\beta|\le m}(-1)^\alpha D^\alpha a_{\alpha, \beta}(x)D^\beta, a_{\alpha, \beta}(\cdot)\in C^{\infty}({\overline\Omega}), on smooth (bounded or unbounded) domains in \bbR^n with compact boundary. Using the concept of boundary triples and operator-valued Weyl-Titchmarsh functions, we prove various trace ideal properties of powers of resolvent differences of these closed realizations of \cA and derive estimates on eigenvalues of certain self-adjoint realizations in spectral gaps of the Dirichlet realization.   Our results extend classical theorems due to Visik, Povzner, Birman, and Grubb.
