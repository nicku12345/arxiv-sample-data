The paper deals with the Sturm-Liouville operator  Ly=-y^{\prime\prime}+q(x)y,\qquad x\in\lbrack0,1],  generated in the space L_{2}=L_{2}[0,1] by periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions. Several theorems on Riesz basis property of the root functions of the operator L are proved. One of the main results is the following. \textsl{Let q belong to Sobolev space W_{1}^{p}[0,1] with some integer p\geq0 and satisfy the conditions q^{(k)}(0)=q^{(k)}(1)=0 for 0\leq k\leq s-1, where s}\leq p. \textsl{Let the functions Q and S be defined by the equalities Q(x)=\int_{0}^{x}q(t) dt, S(x)=Q^{2}(x) and let q_{n}%, Q_{n},S_{n} be the Fourier coefficients of q,Q,S with respect to the trigonometric system \{e^{2\pi inx}\}_{-\infty}^{\infty}. Assume that the sequence q_{2n}-S_{2n}+2Q_{0}Q_{2n} decreases not faster than the powers n^{-s-2}. Then the system of eigen and associated functions of the operator L generated by periodic boundary conditions forms a Riesz basis in the space L_{2}[0,1] (provided that the eigenfunctions are normalized) if and only if the condition  q_{2n}-S_{2n}+Q_{0}Q_{2n}\asymp q_{-2n}-S_{-2n}+2Q_{0}Q_{-2n},\quad n>1,  holds.
