The operator-theoretic renormalization group (RG) methods are powerful analytic tools to explore spectral properties of field-theoretical models such as quantum electrodynamics (QED) with non-relativistic matter. In this paper these methods are extended and simplified. In a companion paper, our variant of operator-theoretic RG methods is applied to establishing the limiting absorption principle in non-relativistic QED near the ground state energy
