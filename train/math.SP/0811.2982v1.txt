Let \Omega be a bounded domain in R^n with C^2-smooth boundary of co-dimension 1, and let H=-\Delta +V(x) be a Schr\"odinger operator on \Omega with potential V locally bounded. We seek the weakest conditions we can find on the rate of growth of the potential V close to the boundary which guarantee essential self-adjointness of H on C_0^\infty(\Omega). As a special case of an abstract condition, we add optimal logarithmic type corrections to the known condition V(x)\geq \frac{3}{4d(x)^2}, where d(x)=dist(x,\partial\Omega). The constant 1 in front of each logarithmic term in Theorem 2 is optimal. The proof is based on a refined Agmon exponential estimate combined with a well known multidimensional Hardy inequality.
