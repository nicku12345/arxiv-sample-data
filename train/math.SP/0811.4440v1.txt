Let \bf M be a smooth compact oriented Riemannian manifold, and let \Delta_{\bf M} be the Laplace-Beltrami operator on {\bf M}. Say 0 \neq f \in \mathcal{S}(\RR^+), and that f(0) = 0. For t > 0, let K_t(x,y) denote the kernel of f(t^2 \Delta_{\bf M}). We show that K_t is well-localized near the diagonal, in the sense that it satisfies estimates akin to those satisfied by the kernel of the convolution operator f(t^2\Delta) on \RR^n. We define continuous {\cal S}-wavelets on {\bf M}, in such a manner that K_t(x,y) satisfies this definition, because of its localization near the diagonal. Continuous {\cal S}-wavelets on {\bf M} are analogous to continuous wavelets on \RR^n in \mathcal{S}(\RR^n). In particular, we are able to characterize the H\ddot{o}lder continuous functions on {\bf M} by the size of their continuous {\mathcal{S}}-wavelet transforms, for H\ddot{o}lder exponents strictly between 0 and 1. If \bf M is the torus \TT^2 or the sphere S^2, and f(s)=se^{-s} (the ``Mexican hat'' situation), we obtain two explicit approximate formulas for K_t, one to be used when t is large, and one to be used when t is small.
