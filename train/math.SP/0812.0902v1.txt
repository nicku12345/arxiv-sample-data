The tensor and exterior squares of a completely continuous non-negative linear operator A acting in the ideal space X(\Omega) are studied. The theorem representing the point spectrum (except, probably, zero) of the tensor square A \otimes A in the terms of the spectrum of the initial operator A is proved. The existence of the second (according to the module) positive eigenvalue \lambda_2, or a pair of complex adjoint eigenvalues of a completely continuous non-negative operator A is proved under the additional condition, that its exterior square A\wedge A is also nonnegative.
