This paper, devoted to the study of spectral pollution, contains both abstract results and applications to some self-adjoint operators with a gap in their essential spectrum occuring in Quantum Mechanics. First we consider Galerkin basis which respect the decomposition of the ambient Hilbert space into a direct sum H=PH\oplus(1-P)H, given by a fixed orthogonal projector P, and we localize the polluted spectrum exactly. This is followed by applications to periodic Schr\"odinger operators (pollution is absent in a Wannier-type basis), and to Dirac operator (several natural decompositions are considered). In the second part, we add the constraint that within the Galerkin basis there is a certain relation between vectors in PH and vectors in (1-P)H. Abstract results are proved and applied to several practical methods like the famous "kinetic balance" of relativistic Quantum Mechanics.
