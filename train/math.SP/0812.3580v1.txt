For a cylindrical superconductor surrounded by a normal material, we discuss transition to the normal phase of stable, locally stable and critical configurations. Associated with those phase transitions, we define critical magnetic fields and we provide a sufficient condition for which those critical fields coincide. In particular, when the conductivity ratio of the superconducting and the normal material is large, we show that the aforementioned critical magnetic fields coincide, thereby proving that the transition to the normal phase is sharp. One key-ingredient in the paper is the analysis of an elliptic boundary value problem involving `transmission' boundary conditions. Another key-ingredient involves a monotonicity result (with respect to the magnetic field strength) of the first eigenvalue of a magnetic Schroedinger operator with discontinuous coefficients.
