We consider a periodic magnetic Schr\"odinger operator H^h, depending on the semiclassical parameter h>0, on a noncompact Riemannian manifold M such that H^1(M, {\mathbb R})=0 endowed with a properly discontinuous cocompact isometric action of a discrete group. We assume that there is no electric field and that the magnetic field has a periodic set of compact magnetic wells. We suppose that the magnetic field vanishes regularly on a hypersurface S. First, we prove upper and lower estimates for the bottom \lambda_0(H^h) of the spectrum of the operator H^hin L^2(M). Then, assuming the existence of non-degenerate miniwells for the reduced spectral problem on S, we prove the existence of an arbitrary large number of spectral gaps for the operator H^h in the region close to \lambda_0(H^h), as h\to 0. In this case, we also obtain upper estimates for the eigenvalues of the one-well problem.
