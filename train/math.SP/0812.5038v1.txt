We give a survey of some results, mainly obtained by the authors and their collaborators, on spectral properties of the magnetic Schr\"odinger operators in the semiclassical limit. We focus our discussion on asymptotic behavior of the individual eigenvalues for operators on closed manifolds and existence of gaps in intervals close to the bottom of the spectrum of periodic operators.
