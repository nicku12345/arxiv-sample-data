Let \Omega_0 be a polygon in \RR^2, or more generally a compact surface with piecewise smooth boundary and corners. Suppose that \Omega_\e is a family of surfaces with \calC^\infty boundary which converges to \Omega_0 smoothly away from the corners, and in a precise way at the vertices to be described in the paper. Fedosov \cite{Fe}, Kac \cite{K} and McKean-Singer \cite{MS} recognized that certain heat trace coefficients, in particular the coefficient of t^0, are not continuous as \e \searrow 0. We describe this anomaly using renormalized heat invariants of an auxiliary smooth domain Z which models the corner formation. The result applies both for Dirichlet and Neumann conditions. We also include a discussion of what one might expect in higher dimensions.
