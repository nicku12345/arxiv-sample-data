We give a formula relating the L^2-isoperimetric profile to the spectral distribution of the Laplace operator associated to a finitely generated group \Gamma or a Riemannian manifold with a cocompact, isometric \Gamma-action. As a consequence, we can apply techniques from geometric group theory to estimate the spectral distribution of the Laplace operator in terms of the growth and the F{\o}lner's function of the group, generalizing previous estimates by Gromov and Shubin. This leads, in particular, to sharp estimates of the spectral distributions for several classes of solvable groups. Furthermore, we prove the asymptotic invariance of the spectral distribution under changes of measures with finite second moment.
