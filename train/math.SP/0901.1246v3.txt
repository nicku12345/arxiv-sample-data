We prove, under a certain boundedness condition at infinity on the (\bar{X}^{\top}, \bar{X}^{\bot})-component of the second fundamental form, the vanishing of the essential spectrum of a complete minimal \bar{X}-bounded and \bar{X}-properly immersed submanifold on a Riemannian manifold endowed with a strongly convex vector field \bar{X}. The same conclusion also holds for any complete minimal h-bounded and h-properly immersed submanifold that lies in a open set of a Riemannian manifold \oM supporting a nonnegative strictly convex function h. This extends a recent result of Bessa, Jorge and Montenegro on the spectrum of Martin-Morales minimal surfaces. Our proof uses as main tool an extension of Barta's theorem given in \cite{BM}
