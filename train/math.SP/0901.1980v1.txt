We consider the 3D Schr\"odinger operator H_0 with constant magnetic field and subject to an electric potential v_0 depending only on the variable along the magnetic field x_3. The operator H_0 has infinitely many eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity embedded in its continuous spectrum. We perturb H_0 by smooth scalar potentials V=O((x_1,x_2)>^{-\de_\perp}x_3>^{-\de_\parallel}), \de_\perp>2, \de_\parallel>1. We assume also that V and v_0 have an analytic continuation, in the magnetic field direction, in a complex sector outside a compact set. We define the resonances of H=H_0+V as the eigenvalues of the non-selfadjoint operator obtained from H by analytic distortions of \R_{x_3}. We study their distribution near any fixed real eigenvalue of H_0, 2bq+\la for q\in\N. In a ring centered at 2bq+\la with radiuses (r,2r), we establish an upper bound, as r tends to 0, of the number of resonances. This upper bound depends on the decay of V at infinity only in the directions (x_1,x_2). Finally, we deduce a representation of the derivative of the spectral shift function (SSF) for the operator pair (H_0,H) in terms of resonances. This representation justifies the Breit-Wigner approximation and implies a local trace formula.
