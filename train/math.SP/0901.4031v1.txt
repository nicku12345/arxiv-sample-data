Consider a family of infinite tri--diagonal matrices of the form L+ zB, where the matrix L is diagonal with entries L_{kk}= k^2, and the matrix B is off--diagonal, with nonzero entries B_{k,{k+1}}=B_{{k+1},k}= k^\alpha, 0 \leq \alpha < 2. The spectrum of L+ zB is discrete. For small |z| the n-th eigenvalue E_n (z), E_n (0) = n^2, is a well--defined analytic function. Let R_n be the convergence radius of its Taylor's series about z= 0. It is proved that  R_n \leq C(\alpha) n^{2-\alpha} \quad \text{if} 0 \leq \alpha <11/6.
