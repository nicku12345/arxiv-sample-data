In this article, we prove the finiteness of the number of eigenvalues for a class of Schr\"odinger operators H = -\Delta + V(x) with a complex-valued potential V(x) on \bR^n, n \ge 2. If \Im V is sufficiently small, \Im V \le 0 and \Im V \neq 0, we show that N(V) = N(\Re V)+ k, where k is the multiplicity of the zero resonance of the selfadjoint operator -\Delta + \Re V and N(W) the number of eigenvalues of -\Delta + W, counted according to their algebraic multiplicity.
