In this paper we show that bounded analytic domains in \R^n with mirror symmetries across all coordinate axes are spectrally determined among other such domains. Our approach builds on finding concrete formulas for the wave invariants at a bouncing ball orbit. The wave invariants are calculated from a stationary phase expansion applied to a well-constructed microlocal parametrix for the trace of the resolvent.
