We prove some general Sobolev-Orlicz, Nash and Faber-Krahn inequalities for positive operators of given ultracontractive norms of the spectral projectors on ]0, lambda]. For invariant operators on coverings of finite simplicial complexes this "ultracontractive spectral decay" is equivalent to von-Neumann's spectral density function. This allows in the polynomial decay case to relate the Novikov-Shubin numbers of such coverings to Sobolev inequalities on exact \ell^2-cochains, and to the vanishing of the torsion of the \ell^{p,2}-cohomology for some p \geq 2.
