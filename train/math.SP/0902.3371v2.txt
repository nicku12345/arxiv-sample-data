We consider the Schr\"odinger operator in {\mathbb R}^n, n\geq 3, with the electric potential V and the magnetic potential A being periodic functions (with a common period lattice) and prove absolute continuity of the spectrum of the operator in question under some conditions which, in particular, are satisfied if V\in L^{n/2}_{{\mathrm {loc}}}({\mathbb R}^n) and A\in H^q_{{\mathrm {loc}}}({\mathbb R}^n;{\mathbb R}^n), q>(n-1)/2.
