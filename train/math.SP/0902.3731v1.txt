In this study we investigate the bound states of the Hamiltonian describing a quantum particle living on three dimensional straight strip of width d. We impose the Neumann boundary condition on a disc window of radius a and Dirichlet boundary conditions on the remained part of the boundary of the strip. We prove that such system exhibits discrete eigenvalues below the essential spectrum for any a>0. We give also a numeric estimation of the number of discrete eigenvalue as a function of \displaystyle \frac{a}{d}. When a tends to the infinity, the asymptotic of the eigenvalue is given.
