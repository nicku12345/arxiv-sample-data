We investigate trace formulas for one-dimensional Schroedinger operators which are trace class perturbations of quasi-periodic finite-gap operators using Krein's spectral shift theory. In particular, we establish the conserved quantities for the solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy in this class and relate them to the reflection coefficients via Abelian integrals on the underlying hyperelliptic Riemann surface.
