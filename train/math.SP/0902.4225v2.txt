Let \CmZ_{Y_0(N)} be the constant term of the logarithmic derivative at s=1 of the Selberg zeta function of the modular curve Y_0(N). Jorgenson and Kramer established the bound \CmZ_{Y_0(N)}=O_\epsilon(N^\epsilon), \epsilon>0 by relating it to geometric invariants. In this article we give, for N prime, another proof via L-functions and exponential sums improving on a previous approach by Abbes-Ullmo and Michel-Ullmo. We further derive a power of \log N bound along the same line.
