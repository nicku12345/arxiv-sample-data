One of the fundamental results in the theory of localization for discrete Schr\"odinger operators with random potentials is the exponential decay of Green's function and the absence of continuous spectrum. In this paper we provide a new variant of these results for one-dimensional alloy-type potentials with finitely supported sign-changing single-site potentials using the fractional moment method.
