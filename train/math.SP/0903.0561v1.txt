We present an overview over recent results concerning semi-classical spectral estimates for magnetic Schroedinger operators. We discuss how the constants in magnetic and non-magnetic eigenvalue bounds are related and we prove, in an abstract setting, that any non-magnetic Lieb-Thirring-type inequality implies a magnetic Lieb-Thirring-type inequality with possibly a larger constant.
