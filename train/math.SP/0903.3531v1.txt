We consider the pseudorelativistic no-pair Brown-Ravenhall operator for the description of relativistic one-electron ions in a homogeneous magnetic field B. It is shown for central charge not exceeding Z=87 that their ground state energy decreases according to the square root of B as B tends to infinity, in contrast to the nonrelativistic behaviour.
