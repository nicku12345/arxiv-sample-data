We prove the limiting absorption principle for the standard model of the non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) and for the Nelson model describing interactions of electrons with phonons. To this end we use the spectral renormalization group technique on the continuous spectrum in conjunction with the Mourre theory.
