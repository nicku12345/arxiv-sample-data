We prove that if 0<\a<1 and f is in the H\"older class \L_\a(\R), then for arbitrary self-adjoint operators A and B with bounded A-B, the operator f(A)-f(B) is bounded and \|f(A)-f(B)\|\le\const\|A-B\|^\a. We prove a similar result for functions f of the Zygmund class \L_1(\R): \|f(A+K)-2f(A)+f(A-K)\|\le\const\|K\|, where A and K are self-adjoint operators. Similar results also hold for all H\"older-Zygmund classes \L_\a(\R), \a>0. We also study properties of the operators f(A)-f(B) for f\in\L_\a(\R) and self-adjoint operators A and B such that A-B belongs to the Schatten--von Neumann class \bS_p. We consider the same problem for higher order differences. Similar results also hold for unitary operators and for contractions.
