This is a survey article. We consider different problems in connection with the behavior of functions of operators under perturbations of operators. We deal with three classes of operators: unitary operators, self-adjoint operators, and contractions. We study operator Lipschitz and operator differentiable functions. We also study the behavior of functions under perturbations of an operator by an operator of Schatten--von Neumann class \bS_p and apply the results to the Livschits--Krein and Koplienko--Neidhardt trace formulae. We also include in this survey article recent unexpected results obtained in a joint paper with Aleksandrov on operator H\"older--Zygmund functions.
