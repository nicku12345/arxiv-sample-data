We consider the 1D Schr\"odinger operator Hy=-y''+(p+q)y with a periodic potential p plus compactly supported potential q on the real line. The spectrum of H consists of an absolutely continuous part plus a finite number of simple eigenvalues in each spectral gap \g_n\ne \es, n\geq 0, where \g_0 is unbounded gap. We prove the following results:   1) we determine the distribution of resonances in the disk with large radius,   2) a forbidden domain for the resonances is specified, 3) the asymptotics of eigenvalues and antibound states are determined, 4) if q_0=\int_\R qdx=0, then roughly speaking in each nondegenerate gap \g_n for n large enough there are two eigenvalues and zero antibound state or zero eigenvalues and two antibound states, 5) if H has infinitely many gaps in the continuous spectrum, then for any sequence \s=(\s)_1^\iy, \s_n\in \{0,2\}, there exists a compactly supported potential q such that H has \s_n bound states and 2-\s_n antibound states in each gap \g_n for n large enough. 6) For any q (with q_0=0), \s=(\s_n)_{1}^\iy, where \s_n\in \{0,2\} and for any sequence \d=(\d_n)_1^\iy\in \ell^2, \d_n>0 there exists a potential p\in L^2(0,1) such that each gap length |\g_n|=\d_n, n\ge 1 and H has exactly \s_n eigenvalues and 2-\s_n antibound states in each gap \g_n\ne \es for n large enough.
