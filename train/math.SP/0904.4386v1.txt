We study the Feynman-Kac semigroup generated by the Schr{\"o}dinger operator based on the fractional Laplacian -(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} - q in \Rd, for q \ge 0, \alpha \in (0,2). We obtain sharp estimates of the first eigenfunction \phi_1 of the Schr{\"o}dinger operator and conditions equivalent to intrinsic ultracontractivity of the Feynman-Kac semigroup. For potentials q such that \lim_{|x| \to \infty} q(x) = \infty and comparable on unit balls we obtain that \phi_1(x) is comparable to (|x| + 1)^{-d - \alpha} (q(x) + 1)^{-1} and intrinsic ultracontractivity holds iff \lim_{|x| \to \infty} q(x)/\log|x| = \infty. Proofs are based on uniform estimates of q-harmonic functions.
