Discussed are \pm m modes and \pm m resonances of Dirac operators with vector potentials H_{\!A}= \alpha \cdot (D - A(x)) + m \beta. Asymptotic limits of \pm m modes at infinity are derived when |A(x)| \le C<x>^{-\rho}, \rho > 1, provided that H_A has \pm m modes. In wider classes of vector potentials, sparseness of the vector potentials which give rise to the \pm m modes of H_A are established. It is proved that no H_A has \pm m resonances if |A(x)|\le C<x>^{-\rho}, \rho >3/2.
