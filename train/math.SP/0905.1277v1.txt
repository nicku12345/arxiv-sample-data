Let X be a connected Riemannian manifold such that the resolvent of the free Laplacian (\Delta-z)^{-1}, z\in\C\setminus\R^{+}, has a meromorphic continuation through \R^{+}. The poles of this continuation are called resonances. When X has some symmetries, we construct complex-valued potentials, V, such that the resolvent of \Delta+V, which has also a meromorphic continuation, has the same resonances with multiplicities as the free Laplacian.
