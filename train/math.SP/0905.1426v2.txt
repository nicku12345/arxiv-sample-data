We generalize a previous inequality related to a sharp version of the Littlewood conjecture on the minimal L_1-norm of N-term exponential sums f on the unit circle. The new result concerns replacing the expression \log(1+t|f|^2) with \log (\sum_{k=1}^K t_k|f_{k}|^2). The proof occurs on the level of finite Toeplitz matrices, where it reduces to an inequality between their polarized determinants (or "mixed discriminants").
