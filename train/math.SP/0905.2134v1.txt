When solitary waves are characterized as homoclinic orbits of a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, they have an integer-valued topological invariant, the Maslov index. We are interested in developing a robust numerical algorithm to compute the Maslov index, to understand its properties, and to study the implications for the stability of solitary waves. The algorithms reported here are developed in the exterior algebra representation, which leads to a robust and fast algorithm with some novel properties. We use two different representations for the Maslov index, one based on an intersection index and one based on approximating the homoclinic orbit by a sequence of periodic orbits. New results on the Maslov index for solitary wave solutions of reaction-diffusion equations, the fifth-order Korteweg-De Vries equation, and the longwave-shortwave resonance equations are presented. Part 1 considers the case of four-dimensional phase space, and Part 2 considers the case of 2n-dimensional phase space with n>2.
