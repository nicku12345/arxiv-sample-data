We study the spectrum of the Laplace operator of a complete minimal properly immersed hypersurface M in \R^{n+1}. (1) Under a volume growth condition on extrinsic balls and a condition on the unit normal at infinity, we prove that M has only essential spectrum consisting of the half line [0, +\infty). This is the case when \lim_{\tilde{r}\to +\infty}\tilde{r}\kappa_i=0, where \tilde{r} is the extrinsic distance to a point of M and \kappa_i are the principal curvatures. (2) If the \kappa_i satisfy the decay conditions |\kappa_i|\leq 1/\tilde{r}, and strict inequality is achieved at some point y\in M, then there are no eigenvalues. We apply these results to minimal graphic and multigraphic hypersurfaces.
