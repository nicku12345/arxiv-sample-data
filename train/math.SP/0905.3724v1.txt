For full-line Jacobi matrices, Schr\"odinger operators, and CMV matrices, we show that being reflectionless, in the sense of the well-known property of m-functions, is equivalent to a lack of reflection in the dynamics in the sense that any state that goes entirely to x=-\infty as t\to -\infty  goes entirely to x=\infty as t\to\infty. This allows us to settle a conjecture of Deift and Simon from 1983 regarding ergodic Jacobi matrices.
