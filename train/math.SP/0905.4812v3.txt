We study the variational problem \inf \{\lambda_k(\Omega): \Omega\ \textup{open in}\ \R^m,\ |\Omega| < \infty, \ \h(\partial \Omega) \le 1 \}, where \lambda_k(\Omega) is the k'th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian acting in L^2(\Omega), \h(\partial \Omega) is the (m-1)- dimensional Hausdorff measure of the boundary of \Omega, and |\Omega| is the Lebesgue measure of \Omega. If m=2, and k=2,3, \cdots, then there exists a convex minimiser \Omega_{2,k}. If m \ge 2, and if \Omega_{m,k} is a minimiser, then \Omega_{m,k}^*:= \textup{int}(\overline{\Omega_{m,k}}) is also a minimiser, and \R^m\setminus \Omega_{m,k}^* is connected. Upper bounds are obtained for the number of components of \Omega_{m,k}. It is shown that if m\ge 3, and k\le m+1 then \Omega_{m,k} has at most 4 components. Furthermore \Omega_{m,k} is connected in the following cases : (i) m\ge 2, k=2, (ii) m=3,4,5, and k=3,4, (iii) m=4,5, and k=5, (iv) m=5 and k=6. Finally, upper bounds on the number of components are obtained for minimisers for other constraints such as the Lebesgue measure and the torsional rigidity.
