We consider a non-self-adjoint h-pseudodifferential operator P in the semi-classical limit (h\to 0). If p is the leading symbol, then under suitable assumptions about the behaviour of p at infinity, we know that the resolvent (z-P)^{-1} is uniformly bounded for z in any compact set not intersecting the closure of the range of p. Under a subellipticity condition, we show that the resolvent extends locally inside the range up to a distance {\cal O}(1)((h\ln \frac{1}{h})^{k/(k+1)}) from certain boundary points, where k\in \{2,4,...\}. This is a slight improvement of a result by Dencker, Zworski and the author, and it has recently been obtained by W. Bordeaux Montrieux in a model situation where k=2. The method of proof is different from the one of Dencker et al, and is based on estimates of an associated semi-group.
