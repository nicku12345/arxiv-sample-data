We introduce a notion of weak isospectrality for continuous deformations. Consider the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary with Robin boundary conditions. Given a Kronecker invariant torus \Lambda of the billiard ball map with a vector of rotation satisfying a Diophantine condition we prove that certain integrals on \Lambda involving the function in the Robin boundary conditions remain constant under weak isospectral deformations. To this end we construct continuous families of quasimodes associated with \Lambda. We obtain also isospectral invariants of the Laplacian with a real-valued potential on a compact manifold for continuous deformations of the potential. As an application we prove spectral rigidity in the case of Liouville billiard tables of dimension two.
