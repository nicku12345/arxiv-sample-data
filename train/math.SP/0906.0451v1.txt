The notion of a Radon transform is introduced for completely integrable billiard tables. In the case of Liouville billiard tables of dimension 3 we prove that the Radon transform is one-to-one on the space of continuous functions K on the boundary which are invariant with respect to the corresponding group of symmetries. We prove also that the frequency map associated with a class of Liouville billiard tables is non-degenerate. This allows us to obtain spectral rigidity of the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator with Robin boundary conditions.
