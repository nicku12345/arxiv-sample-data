We develop the complex scaling method for the Dirichlet Laplacian in a domain with asymptotically cylindrical end. We define resonances as discrete eigenvalues of non-selfadjoint operators, obtained as deformations of the selfadjoint Dirichlet Laplacian \Delta by means of the complex scaling. The resonances are identified with the poles of the resolvent matrix elements ((\Delta-\mu)^{-1}F, G) meromorphic continuation in \mu across the essential spectrum of \Delta, where F and G are elements of an explicitly given set of partial analytic vectors. It turns out that the Dirichlet Laplacian has no singular continuous spectrum, and its eigenvalues can accumulate only at threshold values of the spectral parameter.
