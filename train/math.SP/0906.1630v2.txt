Let \fre\subset\bbR be a finite union of disjoint closed intervals. We study measures whose essential support is \fre and whose discrete eigenvalues obey a 1/2-power condition. We show that a Szeg\H{o} condition is equivalent to \[ \limsup \f{a_1... a_n}{\ca(\fre)^n}>0 \] (this includes prior results of Widom and Peherstorfer--Yuditskii). Using Remling's extension of the Denisov--Rakhmanov theorem and an analysis of Jost functions, we provide a new proof of Szeg\H{o} asymptotics, including L^2 asymptotics on the spectrum. We use heavily the covering map formalism of Sodin--Yuditskii as presented in our first paper in this series.
