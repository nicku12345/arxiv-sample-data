A periodic one-dimensional Schroedinger operator is called semifinite-gap if every second gap in its spectrum is eventually closed. We construct explicit examples of semifinite-gap Schroedinger operators in trigonometric functions by applying Darboux transformations to the Whittaker-Hill equation. We give a criterion of the regularity of the corresponding potentials and investigate the spectral properties of the new operators.
