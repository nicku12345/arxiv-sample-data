An obstacle K \subset \R^n,\: n \geq 3, n odd, is called trapping if there exists at least one generalized bicharacteristic \gamma(t) of the wave equation staying in a neighborhood of K for all t \geq 0. We examine the singularities of the scattering kernel s(t, \theta, \omega) defined as the Fourier transform of the scattering amplitude a(\lambda, \theta, \omega) related to the Dirichlet problem for the wave equation in \Omega = \R^n \setminus K. We prove that if K is trapping and \gamma(t) is non-degenerate, then there exist reflecting (\omega_m, \theta_m)-rays \delta_m,\: m \in \N, with sojourn times T_m \to +\infty as m \to \infty, so that -T_m \in {\rm sing}\:{\rm supp}\: s(t, \theta_m, \omega_m),\: \forall m \in \N. We apply this property to study the behavior of the scattering amplitude in \C.
