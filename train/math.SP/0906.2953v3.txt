In this work we construct certain general bundles <\mathfrak{M},\rho,X> and <\mathfrak{B},\eta,X> of Hausdorff locally convex spaces associated with a given Banach bundle <\mathfrak{E},\pi,X>. Then we present conditions ensuring the existence of bounded sections \mathcal{U}\in \Gamma^{x_{\infty}}(\rho) and \mathcal{P}\in \Gamma^{x_{\infty}}(\eta) both continuous at a point x_{\infty}\in X, such that \mathcal{U}(x) is a C_{0}-semigroup of contractions on \mathfrak{E}_{x} and \mathcal{P}(x) is a spectral projector of the infinitesimal generator of the semigroup \mathcal{U}(x), for every x\in X.
