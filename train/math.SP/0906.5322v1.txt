We argue that the spectral theory of non-reversible Markov chains may often be more effectively cast within the framework of the naturally associated weighted-L_\infty space L_\infty^V, instead of the usual Hilbert space L_2=L_2(\pi), where \pi is the invariant measure of the chain. This observation is, in part, based on the following results. A discrete-time Markov chain with values in a general state space is geometrically ergodic if and only if its transition kernel admits a spectral gap in L_\infty^V. If the chain is reversible, the same equivalence holds with L_2 in place of L_\infty^V, but in the absence of reversibility it fails: There are (necessarily non-reversible, geometrically ergodic) chains that admit a spectral gap in L_\infty^V but not in L_2. Moreover, if a chain admits a spectral gap in L_2, then for any h\in L_2 there exists a Lyapunov function V_h\in L_1 such that V_h dominates h and the chain admits a spectral gap in L_\infty^{V_h}. The relationship between the size of the spectral gap in L_\infty^V or L_2, and the rate at which the chain converges to equilibrium is also briefly discussed.
