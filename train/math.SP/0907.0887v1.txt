We consider a periodic self-adjoint pseudo-differential operator H=(-\Delta)^m+B, m>0, in \R^d which satisfies the following conditions: (i) the symbol of B is smooth in \bx, and (ii) the perturbation B has order less than 2m. Under these assumptions, we prove that the spectrum of H contains a half-line. This, in particular implies the Bethe-Sommerfeld Conjecture for the Schr\"odinger operator with a periodic magnetic potential in all dimensions.
