We prove the unitary equivalence of the inverse of the Krein--von Neumann extension (on the orthogonal complement of its kernel) of a densely defined, closed, strictly positive operator, S\geq \epsilon I_{\mathcal{H}} for some \epsilon >0 in a Hilbert space \mathcal{H} to an abstract buckling problem operator.   In the concrete case where S=\bar{-\Delta|_{C_0^\infty(\Omega)}} in L^2(\Omega; d^n x) for \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n an open, bounded (and sufficiently regular) domain, this recovers, as a particular case of a general result due to G. Grubb, that the eigenvalue problem for the Krein Laplacian S_K (i.e., the Krein--von Neumann extension of S), \[ S_K v = \lambda v, \quad \lambda \neq 0, \] is in one-to-one correspondence with the problem of {\em the buckling of a clamped plate}, \[ (-\Delta)^2u=\lambda (-\Delta) u \text{in} \Omega, \quad \lambda \neq 0, \quad u\in H_0^2(\Omega), \] where u and v are related via the pair of formulas \[ u = S_F^{-1} (-\Delta) v, \quad v = \lambda^{-1}(-\Delta) u, \] with S_F the Friedrichs extension of S.   This establishes the Krein extension as a natural object in elasticity theory (in analogy to the Friedrichs extension, which found natural applications in quantum mechanics, elasticity, etc.).
