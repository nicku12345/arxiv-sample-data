In the smooth scattering theory framework, we consider a pair of self-adjoint operators H_0, H and discuss the spectral projections of these operators corresponding to the interval (-\infty,\lambda). The purpose of the paper is to study the spectral properties of the difference D(\lambda) of these spectral projections. We completely describe the absolutely continuous spectrum of the operator D(\lambda) in terms of the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix S(\lambda) for the operators H_{0} and H. We also prove that the singular continuous spectrum of the operator D(\lambda) is empty.
