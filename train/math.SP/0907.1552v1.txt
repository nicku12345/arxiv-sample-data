The first nonzero eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian is shown to be minimal for the degenerate acute isosceles triangle, among all triangles of given diameter. Hence an optimal Poincar\'{e} inequality for triangles is derived.   The proof relies on symmetry of the Neumann fundamental mode for isosceles triangles with aperture less than \pi/3. Antisymmetry is proved for apertures greater than \pi/3.
