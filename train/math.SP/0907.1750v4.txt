This paper has two main goals. First, we are concerned with the classification of self-adjoint extensions of the Laplacian -\Delta\big|_{C^\infty_0(\Omega)} in L^2(\Omega; d^n x). Here, the domain \Omega belongs to a subclass of bounded Lipschitz domains (which we term quasi-convex domains), which contain all convex domains, as well as all domains of class C^{1,r}, for r\in(1/2,1). Second, we establish Krein-type formulas for the resolvents of the various self-adjoint extensions of the Laplacian in quasi-convex domains and study the properties of the corresponding Weyl--Titchmarsh operators (or energy-dependent Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps).   One significant technical innovation in this paper is an extension of the classical boundary trace theory for functions in spaces which lack Sobolev regularity in a traditional sense, but are suitably adapted to the Laplacian.
