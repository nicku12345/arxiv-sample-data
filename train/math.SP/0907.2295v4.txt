In this paper we consider a discrete scale invariant (DSI) process \{X(t), t\in {\bf R^+}\} with scale l>1. We consider to have some fix number of observations in every scale, say T, and to get our samples at discrete points \alpha^k, k\in {\bf W} where \alpha is obtained by the equality l=\alpha^T and {\bf W}=\{0, 1,...\}. So we provide a discrete time scale invariant (DT-SI) process X(\cdot) with parameter space \{\alpha^k, k\in {\bf W}\}. We find the spectral representation of the covariance function of such DT-SI process. By providing harmonic like representation of multi-dimensional self-similar processes, spectral density function of them are presented. We assume that the process \{X(t), t\in {\bf R^+}\} is also Markov in the wide sense and provide a discrete time scale invariant Markov (DT-SIM) process with the above scheme of sampling. We present an example of DT-SIM process, simple Brownian motion, by the above sampling scheme and verify our results. Finally we find the spectral density matrix of such DT-SIM process and show that its associated T-dimensional self-similar Markov process is fully specified by \{R_{j}^H(1),R_{j}^H(0),j=0, 1,..., T-1\} where R_j^H(\tau) is the covariance function of jth and (j+\tau)th observations of the process.
