J-self-adjoint extensions of the Phillips symmetric operator S are studied. The concepts of stable and unstable C-symmetry are introduced in the extension theory framework. The main results are the following: if {A} is a J-self-adjoint extension of S, then either \sigma({A})=\mathbb{R} or \sigma({A})=\mathbb{C}; if {A} has a real spectrum, then {A} has a stable C-symmetry and {A} is similar to a self-adjoint operator; there are no J-self-adjoint extensions of the Phillips operator with unstable C-symmetry.
