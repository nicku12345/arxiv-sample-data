When a Riemannian manifold (M,g) is rotationally symmetric, the critical order of the lower bound of radial curvatures for the absence of eigenvalues of the Laplacian is equal to  -\frac{1}{r}, where r stands for the distance to the center point. In this paper, we shall perturb the Riemannian metric around a rotationally symmetric one and derive growth estimates of solutions to the eigenvalue equation, from which the absence of eigenvalues will follows.
