We characterize the spectrum and essential spectrum of "essentially linear fractional" composition operators acting on the Hardy space H-two of the open unit disc U. When the symbols of these composition operators have Denjoy-Wolff point on the unit circle, the spectrum and essential spectrum coincide. Our work permits us to describe the spectrum and essential spectrum of certain associated weighted composition operators on the Hardy space.
