We extend some recent results of Lubinsky, Levin, Simon, and Totik from measures with compact support to spectral measures of Schr\"odinger operators on the half-line. In particular, we define a reproducing kernel S_L for Schr\"odinger operators and we use it to study the fine spacing of eigenvalues in a box of the half-line Schr\"odinger operator with perturbed periodic potential. We show that if solutions u(\xi, x) are bounded in x by e^{\epsilon x} uniformly for \xi near the spectrum in an average sense and the spectral measure is positive and absolutely continuous in a bounded interval I in the interior of the spectrum with \xi_0\in I, then uniformly in I \frac{S_L(\xi_0 + a/L, \xi_0 + b/L)}{S_L(\xi_0, \xi_0)} \to \frac{\sin(\pi\rho(\xi_0)(a - b))}{\pi\rho(\xi_0)(a - b)}, where \rho(\xi)d\xi is the density of states. We deduce that the eigenvalues near \xi_0 in a large box of size L are spaced asymptotically as \frac{1}{L\rho}. We adapt the methods used to show similar results for orthogonal polynomials.
