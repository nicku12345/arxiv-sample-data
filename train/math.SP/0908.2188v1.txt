We prove quantitative bounds on the eigenvalues of non-selfadjoint unbounded operators obtained from selfadjoint operators by a perturbation that is relatively-Schatten. These bounds are applied to obtain new results on the distribution of eigenvalues of Schroedinger operators with complex potentials.
