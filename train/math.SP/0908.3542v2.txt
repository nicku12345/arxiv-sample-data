Spectral properties of 1-D Schr\"odinger operators \mathrm{H}_{X,\alpha}:=-\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d} x^2} + \sum_{x_{n}\in X}\alpha_n\delta(x-x_n) with local point interactions on a discrete set X=\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty are well studied when d_*:=\inf_{n,k\in\N}|x_n-x_k|>0. Our paper is devoted to the case d_*=0. We consider \mathrm{H}_{X,\alpha} in the framework of extension theory of symmetric operators by applying the technique of boundary triplets and the corresponding Weyl functions.   We show that the spectral properties of \mathrm{H}_{X,\alpha} like self-adjointness, discreteness, and lower semiboundedness correlate with the corresponding spectral properties of certain classes of Jacobi matrices. Based on this connection, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the operators \mathrm{H}_{X,\alpha} to be self-adjoint, lower-semibounded, and discrete in the case d_*=0.   The operators with \delta'-type interactions are investigated too. The obtained results demonstrate that in the case d_*=0, as distinguished from the case d_*>0, the spectral properties of the operators with \delta and \delta'-type interactions are substantially different.
