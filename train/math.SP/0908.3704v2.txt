We consider the 3D Pauli operator with nonconstant magnetic field B of constant direction, perturbed by a symmetric matrix-valued electric potential V whose coefficients decay fast enough at infinity. We investigate the low-energy asymptotics of the corresponding spectral shift function. As a corollary, for generic negative V, we obtain a generalized Levinson formula, relating the low-energy asymptotics of the eigenvalue counting function and of the scattering phase of the perturbed operator.
