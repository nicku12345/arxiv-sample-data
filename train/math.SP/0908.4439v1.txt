We consider the higher order buckling eigenvalues of the following Dirichlet poly-Laplacian in the unit sphere (-\Delta)^p u=\Lambda (-\Delta) u with order p(\geq2). We obtain universal bounds on the (k+1)th eigenvalue in terms of the first kth eigenvalues independent of the domains. In particular, for p=2, our result is sharp than estimates on eigenvalues of the buckling problem obtained by Wang and Xia.
