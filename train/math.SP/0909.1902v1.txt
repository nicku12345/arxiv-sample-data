A refined notion of curvature for a linear system of Hermitian vector spaces, in the sense of Grothendieck, leads to the unitary classification of a large class of analytic Hilbert modules. Specifically, we study Hilbert sub-modules, for which the localizations are of finite (but not constant) dimension, of an analytic function space with a reproducing kernel. The correspondence between analytic Hilbert modules of constant rank and holomorphic Hermitian bundles on domains of \mathbb C^n due to Cowen and Douglas, as well as a natural analytic localization technique derived from the Hochschild cohomology of topological algebras play a major role in the proofs. A series of concrete computations, inspired by representation theory of linear groups, illustrate the abstract concepts of the paper.
