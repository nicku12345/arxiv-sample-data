Bony and H\"afner have recently obtained positive commutator estimates on the Laplacian in the low-energy limit on asymptotically Euclidean spaces; these estimates can be used to prove local energy decay estimates if the metric is non-trapping. We simplify the proof of the estimates of Bony-H\"afner and generalize them to the setting of scattering manifolds (i.e. manifolds with large conic ends), by applying a sharp Poincar\'e inequality. Our main result is the positive commutator estimate  \chi_I(H^2\Delta_g)\frac{i}{2}[H^2\Delta_g,A]\chi_I(H^2\Delta_g) \geq C\chi_I(H^2\Delta_g)^2,  where H\uparrow \infty is a \emph{large} parameter, I is a compact interval in (0,\infty), and \chi_I its indicator function, and where A is a differential operator supported outside a compact set and equal to (1/2)(r D_r +(r D_r)^*) near infinity. The Laplacian can also be modified by the addition of a positive potential of sufficiently rapid decay--the same estimate then holds for the resulting Schr\"odinger operator.
