Selfadjoint Sturm-Liouville operators H_\omega on L_2(a,b) with random potentials are considered and it is proven, using positivity conditions, that for almost every \omega the operator H_\omega does not share eigenvalues with a broad family of random operators and in particular with operators generated in the same way as H_\omega but in L_2(\tilde a,\tilde b) where (\tilde a,\tilde b)\subset(a,b).
