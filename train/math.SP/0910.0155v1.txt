Let t\mapsto A(t) for t\in T be a C^M-mapping with values unbounded operators with compact resolvents and common domain of definition which are self-adjoint or normal. Here C^M stands for C^\om (real analytic), a quasianalytic or non-quasianalytic Denjoy-Carleman class, C^\infty, or a H\"older continuity class C^{0,\al}. The parameter domain T is either \mathbb R or \mathbb R^n or an infinite dimensional convenient vector space. We prove and review results on C^M-dependence on t of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A(t).
