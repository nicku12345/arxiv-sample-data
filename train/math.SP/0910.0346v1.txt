We consider the number of zeros of holomorphic functions in a bounded domain that depend on a small parameter and satisfy an exponential upper bound near the boundary of the domain and similar lower bounds at finitely many points along the boundary. Roughly the number of such zeros is (2\pi h)^{-1} times the integral over the domain of the laplacian of the exponent of the dominating exponential. Such results have already been obtained by M. Hager and by Hager and the author and they are of importance when studying the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of elliptic operators with small random perturbations. In this paper we generalize these results and arrive at geometrically natural statements and natural remainder estimates.
