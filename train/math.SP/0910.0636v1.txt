This is the first in a series of papers on scattering theory for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with highly singular potentials q\in H^{-1}(R). In this paper, we study Miura potentials q associated to positive Schr\"odinger operators that admit a Riccati representation q=u'+u^2 for a unique u\in L^1(R)\cap L^2(R). Such potentials have a well-defined reflection coefficient r(k) that satisfies |r(k)|<1 and determines u uniquely. We show that the scattering map S:u\mapsto r is real-analytic with real-analytic inverse. To do so, we exploit a natural complexification of the scattering map associated with the ZS-AKNS system. In subsequent papers, we will consider larger classes of potentials including singular potentials with bound states.
