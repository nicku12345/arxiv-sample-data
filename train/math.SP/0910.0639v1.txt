This is the second in a series of papers on scattering theory for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with Miura potentials admitting a Riccati representation of the form q=u'+u^2 for some u\in L^2(R). We consider potentials for which there exist `left' and `right' Riccati representatives with prescribed integrability on half-lines. This class includes all Faddeev--Marchenko potentials in L^1(R,(1+|x|)dx) generating positive Schr\"odinger operators as well as many distributional potentials with Dirac delta-functions and Coulomb-like singularities. We completely describe the corresponding set of reflection coefficients r and justify the algorithm reconstructing q from r.
