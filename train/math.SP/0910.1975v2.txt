Let \mu be a matrix-valued measure with the essential spectrum a single interval and countably many point masses outside of it. Under the assumption that the absolutely continuous part of \mu satisfies Szego's condition and the point masses satisfy a Blaschke-type condition, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the orthonormal polynomials on and off the support of the measure.   The result generalizes the scalar analogue of Peherstorfer-Yuditskii and the matrix-valued result of Aptekarev-Nikishin, which handles only a finite number of mass points.
