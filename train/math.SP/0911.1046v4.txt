We address the problem on the right definition of the Schroedinger operator with potential \delta', where \delta is the Dirac delta-function. Namely, we prove the uniform resolvent convergence of a family of Schroedinger operators with regularized short-range potentials \epsilon^{-2}V(x/\epsilon) tending to \delta' in the distributional sense as \epsilon\to 0. In 1986, P. Seba claimed that the limit coincides with the direct sum of free Schroedinger operators on the semi-axes with the Dirichlet boundary condition at the origin, which implies that in dimension one there is no non-trivial Hamiltonians with potential \delta'. Our results demonstrate that, although the above statement is true for many V, for the so-called resonant V the limit operator is defined by the non-trivial interface condition at the origin determined by some spectral characteristics of V. In this resonant case, we show that there is a partial transmission of the wave package for the limiting Hamiltonian.
