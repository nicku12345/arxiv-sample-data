In this note we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the s-numbers of the resolvent difference of two generalized self-adjoint, maximal dissipative or maximal accumulative Robin Laplacians on a bounded domain \Omega with smooth boundary \partial\Omega. For this we apply the recently introduced abstract notion of quasi boundary triples and Weyl functions from extension theory of symmetric operators together with Krein type resolvent formulae and well-known eigenvalue asymptotics of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on \partial\Omega. It will be shown that the resolvent difference of two generalized Robin Laplacians belongs to the Schatten-von Neumann class of any order p for which p>(dim\Omega-1)/3. Moreover, we also give a simple sufficient condition for the resolvent difference of two generalized Robin Laplacians to belong to a Schatten-von Neumann class of arbitrary small order. Our results extend and complement classical theorems due to M.Sh.Birman on Schatten-von Neumann properties of the resolvent differences of Dirichlet, Neumann and self-adjoint Robin Laplacians.
