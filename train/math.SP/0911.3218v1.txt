We consider the Hill operator  Ly = - y^{\prime \prime} + v(x)y, \quad 0 \leq x \leq \pi,  subject to periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions, with potentials v which are trigonometric polynomials with nonzero coefficients, of the form   (i)  ae^{-2ix} +be^{2ix};    (ii)  ae^{-2ix} +Be^{4ix};    (iii)  ae^{-2ix} +Ae^{-4ix} + be^{2ix} +Be^{4ix}.    Then the system of eigenfunctions and (at most finitely many) associated functions is complete but it is not a basis in L^2 ([0,\pi], \mathbb{C}) if |a| \neq |b|  in the case (i), if |A| \neq |B|  and neither -b^2/4B nor -a^2/4A is an integer square in the case (iii), and it is never a basis in the case (ii) subject to periodic boundary conditions.
