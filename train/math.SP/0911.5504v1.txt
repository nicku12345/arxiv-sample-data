In the present paper we give an explicit formula which allows us immediately to describe a unique Gauss circuit on a framed 4-valent graph (a graph with a structure of opposite edges) from an arbitrary Euler tour on the graph whenever the Gauss circuit exists. This formula only depends on the adjacency matrix of an Euler tour and also tells us whether there exists a Gauss tour on a framed 4-valent graph or not. It turns out that the results are also valid for all symmetric matrices (not just realisable by a chord diagram).
