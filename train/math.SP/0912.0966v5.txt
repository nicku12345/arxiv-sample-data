We study the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix \frac{1}{n}M^*M of a large rectangular matrix M=M_{n,p}=(\zeta_{ij})_{1\leq i\leq p;1\leq j\leq n} whose entries are i.i.d. random variables of mean zero, variance one, and having finite C_0th moment for some sufficiently large constant C_0. The main result of this paper is a Four Moment theorem for i.i.d. covariance matrices (analogous to the Four Moment theorem for Wigner matrices established by the authors in [Acta Math. (2011) Random matrices: Universality of local eigenvalue statistics] (see also [Comm. Math. Phys. 298 (2010) 549--572])). We can use this theorem together with existing results to establish universality of local statistics of eigenvalues under mild conditions. As a byproduct of our arguments, we also extend our previous results on random Hermitian matrices to the case in which the entries have finite C_0th moment rather than exponential decay.
