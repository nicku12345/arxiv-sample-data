We establish sharp results on the modulus of continuity of the distribution of the spectral measure for one-frequency Schrodinger operators with Diophantine frequencies in the region of absolutely continuous spectrum. More precisely, we establish 1/2-Holder continuity near almost reducible energies (an essential support of absolutely continuous spectrum). For non-perturbatively small potentials (and for the almost Mathieu operator with subcritical coupling), our results apply for all energies.
