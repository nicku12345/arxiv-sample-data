Let \Omega be a bounded domain with C^2-smooth boundary in an n-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold. It is well-known that for the bi-harmonic equation \Delta^2 u=0 in \Omega with the 0-Dirichlet boundary condition, there exists an infinite set \{u_k\} of biharmonic functions in \Omega with positive eigenvalues \{\lambda_k\} satisfying \Delta u_k+ \lambda_k \varrho \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial \nu}=0 on the boundary \partial \Omega. In this paper, by a new method we establish the Weyl-type asymptotic formula for the counting function of the biharmonic Stekloff eigenvalues \lambda_k.
