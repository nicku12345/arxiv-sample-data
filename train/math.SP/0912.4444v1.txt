This paper is devoted to connections between accelerants and potentials of Krein systems and of canonical systems of Dirac type, both on a finite interval. It is shown that a continuous potential is always generated by an accelerant, provided the latter is continuous with a possible jump discontinuity at the origin. Moreover, the generating accelerant is uniquely determined by the potential. The results are illustrated on pseudo-exponential potentials. The paper is a continuation of the earlier paper of the authors [1] dealing with the direct problem for Krein systems.
