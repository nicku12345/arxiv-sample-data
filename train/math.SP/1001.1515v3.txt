We study the spectrum of an invariant, elliptic, classical pseudodifferential operator on a closed G-manifold M, where G is a compact, connected Lie group acting effectively and isometrically on M. Using resolution of singularities, we determine the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues along the isotypic components, and relate it with the reduction of the corresponding Hamiltonian flow, proving that the equivariant spectral counting function satisfies Weyl's law, together with an estimate for the remainder.
