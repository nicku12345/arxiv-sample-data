We show that in any harmonic space, the eigenvalue spectra of the Laplace operator on small geodesic spheres around a given point determine the norm |\nabla R| of the covariant derivative of the Riemannian curvature tensor in that point. In particular, the spectra of small geodesic spheres in a harmonic space determine whether the space is locally symmetric. For the proof we use the first few heat invariants and consider certain coefficients in the radial power series expansions of the curvature invariants |R|^2 and |Ric|^2 of the geodesic spheres. Moreover, we obtain analogous results for geodesic balls with either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions.
