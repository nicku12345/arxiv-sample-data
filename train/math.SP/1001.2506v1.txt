Let (M,g) be a non-compact riemannian n-manifold with bounded geometry at order k\geq\frac{n}{2}. We show that if the spectrum of the Laplacian starts with q+1 discrete eigenvalues isolated from the essential spectrum, and if the metric is generic for the \Cl C^{k+2}-strong topology, then the eigenvalues are distinct and their associated eigenfunctions are Morse. This generalizes to non-compact manifolds some arguments developped by K. Uhlenbeck. We deduce from this result that if M^n has bounded geometry at order k\geq\frac{n}{2} and has an isolated first eigenvalue for its Laplacian, then for any riemannian covering p : M'\ra M, we have \lambda_0(M) = \sup_D \lambda_0(D), where D\subset M' runs over all connected fundamental domains for p, and \lambda_0(D) is the bottom of the spectrum of D with Neumann boundary conditions.
