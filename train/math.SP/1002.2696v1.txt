A n\times n matrix A, which has a certain sign-symmetric structure (J--sign-symmetric), is studied in this paper. It is shown that such a matrix is similar to a nonnegative matrix. The existence of the second in modulus positive eigenvalue \lambda_2 of a J--sign-symmetric matrix A, or an odd number k of simple eigenvalues, which coincide with the k-th roots of \rho(A)^k, is proved under the additional condition that its second compound matrix is also J--sign-symmetric. The conditions when a J--sign-symmetric matrix with a J--sign-symmetric second compound matrix has complex eigenvalues, which are equal in modulus to \rho(A), are given.
