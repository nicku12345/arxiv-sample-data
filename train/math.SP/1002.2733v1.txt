The purpose of this note is to answer a question A. E. Nussbaum formulated in 1964 about the possible equivalence between weak measurability of a family of densely defined, closed operators T(t), t real, in a separable complex Hilbert space H on one hand, and the notion of measurability of the 2 \times 2 operator-valued matrix of projections onto the graph Gamma(T(t)) of T(t) on the other, in the negative.   Our results demonstrate an interesting distinction between the direct integral over the family of operators T(t) with respect to Lebesgue measure and the naturally maximally defined operator associated with pointwise application of T(t) in the vector-valued Hilbert space L^2(\mathbb R; dt; H).   We also provide explicit criteria for the measurability of the matrix of projections onto the graph Gamma(T(t)) of T(t).
