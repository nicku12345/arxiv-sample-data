We consider the Schr\"odinger operators on zigzag nanoribbons   (quasi-1D tight-binding models) in external magnetic fields and an electric potential V. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the ribbon and the electric field is perpendicular to the axis of the nanoribbon and the magnetic field. If the magnetic and electric fields are absent, then the spectrum of the Schr\"odinger (Laplace) operator consists of two non-flat bands and one flat band (an eigenvalue with infinite multiplicity) between them. If we switch on the magnetic field, then the spectrum of the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator consists of some non-flat bands and one flat band between them. Thus the magnetic field changes the continuous spectrum but does not the flat band. If we switch on a weak electric potential V\to 0, then there are two cases: (1) the flat band splits into the small spectral band. We determine the asymptotics of the spectral bands for small fields. (2) the unperturbed flat band remains the flat band. We describe all potentials when the unperturbed flat band remains the flat band and when one splits into the small band of the continuous spectrum. Moreover, we solve inverse spectral problems for small potentials.
