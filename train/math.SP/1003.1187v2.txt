Improving the efficiency of discrete time scale invariant (DSI) processes, we consider some flexible sampling of a continuous time DSI process {X(t), t\in{R^+}} with scale l>1, which is in correspondence to some multi-dimensional self-similar process. So we consider q samples at arbitrary points s_0, s_1, ..., s_{q-1} in interval [1, l) and proceed in the intervals [l^n, l^{n+1}) at points l^n s_0,l^n s_1, ..., l^n s_{q-1}, n\in Z. So we study an embedded DT-SI process W(nq+k)=X(l^n s_k), q\in N, k= 0, ..., q-1, and its multi-dimensional self-similar counter part V(n)=\big(V^0(n), ..., V^{q-1}(n)\big) where V^k(n)=W(nq+k). We study spectral representation of such process and obtain its spectral density matrix. Finally by imposing wide sense Markov property on W(\cdot) and V(\cdot), we show that the spectral density matrix of V(\cdot) can be characterized by {R_j(1), R_j(0), j=0, ..., q-1} where R_j(k)=E[W(j+k)W(j)].
