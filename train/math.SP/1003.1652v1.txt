Let \Gamma be a cofinite Fuchsian group acting on hyperbolic two-space \HH. Let M=\Gamma \setminus \HH  be the corresponding quotient space. For \gamma, a closed geodesic of M, let l(\gamma) denote its length. The prime geodesic counting function \pi_{M}(u) is defined as the number of \Gamma-inconjugate, primitive, closed geodesics \gamma  such that e^{l(\gamma)} \leq u. The \emph{prime geodesic theorem} implies:   \pi_{M}(u)=\sum_{0 \leq \lambda_{M,j} \leq 1/4} \text{li}(u^{s_{M,j}}) + O_{M}(\frac{u^{3/4}}{\log{u}}),  where 0=\lambda_{M,0} < \lambda_{M,1} <... are the eigenvalues of the hyperbolic Laplacian acting on the space of smooth functions on M and s_{M,j} = \frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{4} - \lambda_{M,j}}.  Let C_{M} be smallest implied constant so that |\pi_{M}(u)-\sum_{0 \leq \lambda_{M,j} \leq 1/4} \text{li}(u^{s_{M,j}})|\leq C_{M}\frac{u^{3/4}}{\log{u}} \quad \text{\text{for all} u > 1.}   We call the (absolute) constant C_{M} the Huber constant. The objective of this paper is to give an effectively computable upper bound of C_{M} for an arbitrary cofinite Fuchsian group. As a corollary we estimate the Huber constant for \PSL(2,\ZZ), we obtain C_{M} \leq 16,607,349,020,658 \approx \exp(30.44086643).
