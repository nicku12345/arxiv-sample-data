We exhibit limit-periodic Schr\"odinger operators that are uniformly localized in the strongest sense possible. That is, for these operators there are uniform exponential decay rates such that every element of the hull has a complete set of eigenvectors that decay exponentially off their centers of localization at least as fast as prescribed by the uniform decay rate. Consequently, these operators exhibit uniform dynamical localization.
