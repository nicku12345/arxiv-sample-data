The first and second representation theorems for sign-indefinite, not necessarily semi-bounded quadratic forms are revisited. New straightforward proofs of these theorems are given. A number of necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring the second representation theorem to hold is proved. A new simple and explicit example of a self-adjoint operator for which the second representation theorem does not hold is also provided.
