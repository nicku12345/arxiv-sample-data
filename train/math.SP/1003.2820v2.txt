For a hyperbolic surface embedded eigenvalues of the Laplace operator are unstable and tend to become resonances. A sufficient dissolving condition was identified by Phillips-Sarnak and is elegantly expressed in Fermi's Golden Rule. We prove formulas for higher approximations and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for dissolving a cusp form with eigenfunction u_j into a resonance. In the framework of perturbations in character varieties, we relate the result to the special values of the L-series L(u_j\otimes F^n, s). This is the Rankin-Selberg convolution of u_j with F(z)^n, where F(z) is the antiderivative of a weight 2 cusp form. In an example we show that the above-mentioned conditions force the embedded eigenvalue to become a resonance in a punctured neighborhood of the deformation space.
