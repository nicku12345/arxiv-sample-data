We use the functorial properties of Rieffel's pseudodifferential calculus to study families of operators associated to topological dynamical systems acted by a symplectic space. Information about the spectra and the essential spectra are extracted from the quasi-orbit structure of the dynamical system. The semi-classical behavior of the families of spectra is also studied.
