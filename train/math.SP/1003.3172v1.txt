In this paper we study a Sturm--Liouville operator Ly=-y"+q(x)y in the space L_2[0,\pi] with Direchlet boundary conditions. Here the potential q is a first order distribution: q\in W_2^{-1}[0,\pi]. Such operators were defined in our previous papers. Here we clerify two leading terms in asymptotic formulae for eigenfunctions of such operators and for functions of biorthogonal system.
