We consider a class of Jacobi matrices with periodically modulated diagonal in a critical hyperbolic ("double root") situation. For the model with "non-smooth" matrix entries we obtain the asymptotics of generalized eigenvectors and analyze the spectrum. In addition, we reformulate a very helpful theorem from a paper of Janas and Moszynski in its full generality in order to serve the needs of our method.
