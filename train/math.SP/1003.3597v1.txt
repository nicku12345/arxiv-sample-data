We consider self-adjoint unbounded Jacobi matrices with diagonal q_n=n and weights \lambda_n=c_n n, where c_n is a 2-periodical sequence of real numbers. The parameter space is decomposed into several separate regions, where the spectrum is either purely absolutely continuous or discrete. This constitutes an example of the spectral phase transition of the first order. We study the lines where the spectral phase transition occurs, obtaining the following main result: either the interval (-\infty;1/2) or the interval (1/2;+\infty) is covered by the absolutely continuous spectrum, the remainder of the spectrum being pure point. The proof is based on finding asymptotics of generalized eigenvectors via the Birkhoff-Adams Theorem. We also consider the degenerate case, which constitutes yet another example of the spectral phase transition.
