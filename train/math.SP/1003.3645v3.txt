Let M be a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold of diameter d and volume \leq V. If \mu_i(M) denotes the i-th egenvalue of the Hodge laplacian acting on coexact 1-forms of M, we prove that \mu_1(M)\geq \frac c{d^3e^{2kd}} and \mu_{k+1}(M)\geq \frac c{d^2}, where c>0 depends only on V, and k is the number of connected component of the thin part of M. Moreover, we prove that for any finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold M_\infty with cusps, there is a sequence M_i of compact fillings of M_\infty of diameter d_i\to+\infty such that \mu_1(M_i)\geq \frac c{d_i^2}.
