The purpose of this paper is to prove that the spectrum of the non-self-adjoint one-particle Hamiltonian proposed by J. Feinberg and A. Zee (Phys. Rev. E 59 (1999), 6433--6443) has interior points. We do this by first recalling that the spectrum of this random operator is the union of the set of \ell^\infty eigenvalues of all infinite matrices with the same structure. We then construct an infinite matrix of this structure for which every point of the open unit disk is an \ell^\infty eigenvalue, this following from the fact that the components of the eigenvector are polynomials in the spectral parameter whose non-zero coefficients are \pm 1's, forming the pattern of an infinite discrete Sierpinski triangle.
