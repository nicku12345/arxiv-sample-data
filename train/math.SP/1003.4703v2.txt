We prove bounds of the form \sum_{e\in I\cap\sigma_\di (H)} \dist (e,\sigma_\e (H))^{1/2} \leq L^1-norm of a perturbation, where I is a gap. Included are gaps in continuum one-dimensional periodic Schr\"odinger operators and finite gap Jacobi matrices where we get a generalized Nevai conjecture about an L^1 condition implying a Szeg\H{o} condition. One key is a general new form of the Birman--Schwinger bound in gaps.
