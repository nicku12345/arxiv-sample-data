In the present paper, we prove an abstract functional analytic criterion for a class of linear partial differential operators acting on a domain \Omega\subseteq\Bbb R^n which are elliptic in the interior to have compact resolvent. This extends known results for magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger operators to more general differential operators. We point out the relationship between the Dirac operator in real dimension two and the \bar\partial-Laplacian on a certain weighted space on \Bbb C and we use this connection to prove a non-compactness result for its resolvent.
