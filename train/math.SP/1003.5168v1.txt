In this paper we consider the analytic torsion of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold associated with the m-th symmetric power of the standard representation of SL(2,C) and we study its asymptotic behavior if m tends to infinity. The leading coefficient of the asymptotic formula is given by the volume of the hyperbolic 3-manifold. It follows that the Reidemeister torsion associated with the symmetric powers determines the volume of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold.
