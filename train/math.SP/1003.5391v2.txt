On any compact manifold of dimension greater than 4, we prescribe the volume and any finite part of the spectrum of the Witten Laplacian acting on p-form for 0<p<n. In particular, we prescribe the multiplicity of the first eigenvalues. On 3-dimensional manifolds, we give examples of multiple first eigenvalue for 1-forms, whose multiplicity depends on the maximal genus of embedded surfaces all of whose 1-cohomology is induced by the cohomology of the manifold. In particular, this multiplicity is at least 3.
