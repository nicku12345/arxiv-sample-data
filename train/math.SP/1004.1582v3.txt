We compute the Fredholm index, {\rm ind}(D_A), of the operator D_A = (d/dt) + A on L^2(\mathbb{R};\mathcal{H}) associated with the operator path \{A(t)\}_{t=-\infty}^{\infty}, where (A f)(t) = A(t) f(t) for a.e. t\in\mathbb{R}, and appropriate f \in L^2(\mathbb{R};\mathcal{H}), via the spectral shift function \xi(\, \cdot \,;A_+,A_-) associated with the pair (A_+, A_-) of asymptotic operators A_{\pm}=A(\pm\infty) on the separable complex Hilbert space \mathcal{H} in the case when A(t) is generally an unbounded (relatively trace class) perturbation of the unbounded self-adjoint operator A_-. We derive a formula (an extension of a formula due to Pushnitski) relating the spectral shift function \xi(\, \cdot \,;A_+,A_-) for the pair (A_+, A_-), and the corresponding spectral shift function \xi(\, \cdot \,;H_2,H_1) for the pair of operators (H_2,H_1)=(D_A {D_A}^*, {D_A}^* D_A) in this relative trace class context. This formula is then used to identify the Fredholm index of D_A with \xi(0;A_+,A_-). In addition, we prove that {\rm ind}(D_A) coincides with the spectral flow SpFlow(\{A(t)\}_{t=-\infty}^\infty) of the family \{A(t)\}_{t\in\mathbb{R}} and also relate it to the (Fredholm) perturbation determinant for the pair (A_+, A_-). We also provide some applications in the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics to zeta function and heat kernel regularized spectral asymmetries and the eta-invariant.
