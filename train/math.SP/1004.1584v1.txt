The spectral properties of two products AB and BA of possibly unbounded operators A and B in a Banach space are considered. The results are applied in the comparison of local spectral properties of the operators T^{[*]} T and TT^{[*]}  in a Krein space. It is shown that under the assumption that both operators T^{[*]} T and T^{[*]}  have non-empty resolvent sets, the operator T^{[*]} T is locally definitizable if and only if TT^{[*]}  is. In this context the critical points of both operators are compared.
