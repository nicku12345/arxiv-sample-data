Given a compact Riemannian manifold M of dimension m\geq 2, we study the space of functions of L^2(M) generated by eigenfunctions of eigenvalues less than L\geq 1 associated to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on M. On these spaces we give a characterization of the Carleson measures and the Logvinenko-Sereda sets.
