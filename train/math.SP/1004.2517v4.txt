In this paper, we prove the upper and lower bounds for normal derivatives of spectral clusters u=\chi_{\lambda}^s f of Dirichlet Laplacian \Delta_M, c_s \lambda\|u\|_{L^2(M)} \leq \| \partial_{\nu}u \|_{L^2(\partial M)} \leq C_s \lambda \|u\|_{L^2(M)}  where the upper bound is true for any Riemannian manifold, and the lower bound is true for some small 0<s<s_M, where s_M depends on the manifold only, provided that M has no trapped geodesics (see Theorem \ref{Thm3} for a precise statement), which generalizes the early results for single eigenfunctions by Hassell and Tao.
