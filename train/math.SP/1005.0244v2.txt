We consider 2-dimensional Schroedinger operator with the non-degenerating magnetic field in the domain with the boundary and under certain non-degeneracy assumptions we derive spectral asymptotics with the remainder estimate better than O(h^{-1}), up to O(\mu^{-1}h^{-1}) and the principal part \asymp h^{-2} where h\ll 1 is Planck constant and \mu \gg 1 is the intensity of the magnetic field; \mu h \le 1. We also consider generalized Schr\"odinger-Pauli operator in the same framework albeit with \mu h\ge 1 and derive spectral asymptotics with the remainder estimate up to O(1) and with the principal part \asymp \mu h^{-1}, or, under certain special circumstances with the principal part \asymp \mu^{1/2} h^{-1/2}.
