We consider 2-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with the non-degenerating magnetic field and we discuss spectral asymptotics with the remainder estimate o(\mu^{-1}h^{-1}) or better. We also consider 3-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with the non-degenerating magnetic field and we discuss spectral asymptotics with the remainder estimate o(\mu^{-1}h^{-1}) or better.   We also consider generalized Schr\"odinger-Pauli operator in the same framework albeit with \mu h\ge 1 and derive spectral asymptotics with the remainder estimate up to O(h^{-1}|\log h|) and with the principal part \asymp \mu h^{-2}.
