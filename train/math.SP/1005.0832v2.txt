In this note, we study Lifshitz tails for a 2D Landau Hamiltonian perturbed by a random alloy-type potential constructed with single site potentials decaying at least at a Gaussian speed. We prove that, if the Landau level stays preserved as a band edge for the perturbed Hamiltonian, at the Landau levels, the integrated density of states has a Lifshitz behavior of the type e^{-\log^2|E-2bq|}.
