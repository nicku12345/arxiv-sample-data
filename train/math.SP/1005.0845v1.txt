In this paper we consider eigenvalues asymptotics of the energy operator in the one of the most interesting models of quantum physics, describing an interaction between two-level system and harmonic oscillator. The energy operator of this model can be reduced to some class of infinite Jacobi matrices. Discrete spectrum of this class of operators represents the perturbed spectrum of harmonic oscillator. The perturbation is an unbounded operator compact with respect to unperturbed one. We use slightly modified Janas-Naboko successive diagonalization approach and some new compactness criteria for infinite matrices. Two first terms of eigenvalues asymptotics and the estimation of remainder are found.
