The behavior of the discrete spectrum of the Schr\"odinger operator -\D - V, in quite a general setting, up to a large extent is determined by the behavior of the corresponding heat kernel P(t;x,y) as t\to 0 and t\to\infty. If this behavior is powerlike, i.e., \[\|P(t;\cdot,\cdot)\|_{L^\infty}=O(t^{-\delta/2}),\ t\to 0;\qquad \|P(t;\cdot,\cdot)\|_{L^\infty}=O(t^{-D/2}),\ t\to\infty,\] then it is natural to call the exponents \delta,D "{\it the local dimension}" and "{\it the dimension at infinity}" respectively. The character of spectral estimates depends on the relation between these dimensions. In the paper we analyze the case where \delta<D that was insufficiently studied before. Our applications concern the combinatorial and the metric graphs.
