We consider the "weighted" operator P_k=-\partial_x a(x)\partial_x on the line with a step-like coefficient which appears when propagation of waves thorough a finite slab of a periodic medium is studied. The medium is transparent at certain resonant frequencies which are related to the complex resonance spectrum of P_k. If the coefficient is periodic on a finite interval (locally periodic) with k identical cells then the resonance spectrum of P_k has band structure. In the present paper we study a transition to semi-infinite medium by taking the limit k\to \infty.   The bands of resonances in the complex lower half plane are localized below the band spectrum of the corresponding periodic problem (k=\infty) with k-1 or k resonances in each band. We prove that as k\to \infty the resonance spectrum converges to the real axis.
