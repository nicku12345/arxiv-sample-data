In this paper we study the Riesz transform on complete and connected Riemannian manifolds M with a certain spectral gap in the L^2 spectrum of the Laplacian. We show that on such manifolds the Riesz transform is L^p bounded for all p \in (1,\infty). This generalizes a result by Mandouvalos and Marias and extends a result by Auscher, Coulhon, Duong, and Hofmann to the case where zero is an isolated point of the L^2 spectrum of the Laplacian.
