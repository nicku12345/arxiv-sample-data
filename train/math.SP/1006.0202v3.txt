We obtain a representation formula for the derivative of the spectral shift function \xi(\lambda; B, \epsilon) related to the operators H_0(B,\epsilon) = (D_x - By)^2 + D_y^2 + \epsilon x and H(B, \epsilon) = H_0(B, \epsilon) + V(x,y), \: B > 0, \epsilon > 0. We prove that the operator H(B, \epsilon) has at most a finite number of embedded eigenvalues on \R which is a step to the proof of the conjecture of absence of embedded eigenvalues of H in \R. Applying the formula for \xi'(\lambda, B, \epsilon), we obtain a semiclassical asymptotics of the spectral shift function related to the operators H_0(h) = (hD_x - By)^2 + h^2D_y^2 + \epsilon x and H(h) = H_0(h) + V(x,y).
