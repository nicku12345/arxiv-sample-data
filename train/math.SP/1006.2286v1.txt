We present a result of localization for a matrix-valued Anderson-Bernoulli operator, acting on L^2(\R)\otimes \R^N, for an arbitrary N\geq 1, whose interaction potential is generic in the real symmetric matrices. For such a generic real symmetric matrix, we construct an explicit interval of energies on which we prove localization, in both spectral and dynamical senses, away from a finite set of critical energies. This construction is based upon the formalism of the F\"urstenberg group to which we apply a general criterion of density in semisimple Lie groups. The algebraic nature of the objects we are considering allows us to prove a generic result on the interaction potential and the finiteness of the set of critical energies.
