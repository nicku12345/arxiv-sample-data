We study in dimension d\geq2 low-energy spectral and scattering asymptotics for two-body d-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with a radially symmetric potential falling off like -\gamma r^{-2},\;\gamma>0. We consider angular momentum sectors, labelled by l=0,1,\dots, for which \gamma>(l+d/2-1)^2. In each such sector the reduced Schr\"odinger operator has infinitely many negative eigenvalues accumulating at zero. We show that the resolvent has a non-trivial oscillatory behaviour as the spectral parameter approaches zero in cones bounded away from the negative half-axis, and we derive an asymptotic formula for the phase shift.
