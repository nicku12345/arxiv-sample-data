If a Jacobi matrix J is reflectionless on (-2,2) and has a single a_{n_0} equal to 1, then J is the free Jacobi matrix a_n\equiv 1, b_n\equiv 0. I'll discuss this result and its generalization to arbitrary sets and present several applications, including the following: if a Jacobi matrix has some portion of its a_n's close to 1, then one assumption in the Denisov-Rakhmanov Theorem can be dropped.
