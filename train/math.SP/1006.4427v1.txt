We report on recent results on the spectral statistics of the discrete Anderson model in the localized phase. Our results show, in particular, that, for the discrete Anderson Hamiltonian with smoothly distributed random potential at sufficiently large coupling, the limit of the level spacing distribution is that of i.i.d. random variables distributed according to the density of states of the random Hamiltonian. This text is a contribution to the proceedings of the conference "Spectra of Random Operators and Related Topics" held at Kyoto University, 02-04/12/09 organized by N. Minami and N. Ueki.
