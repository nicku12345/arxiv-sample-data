I consider random Schr\"odinger operators with exponentially decaying single site potential, which is allowed to change sign. For this model, I prove Anderson localization both in the sense of exponentially decaying eigenfunctions and dynamical localization. Furthermore, the results imply a Wegner-type estimate strong enough to use in classical forms of multi-scale analysis.
