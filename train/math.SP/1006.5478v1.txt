We establish a sharp geometric constant for the upper bound on the resonance counting function for surfaces with hyperbolic ends. An arbitrary metric is allowed within some compact core, and the ends may be of hyperbolic planar, funnel, or cusp type. The constant in the upper bound depends only on the volume of the core and the length parameters associated to the funnel or hyperbolic planar ends. Our estimate is sharp in that it reproduces the exact asymptotic constant in the case of finite-area surfaces with hyperbolic cusp ends, and also in the case of funnel ends with Dirichlet boundary condtiions.
