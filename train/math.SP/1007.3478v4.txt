We extend the multiplicative submodularity of the principal determinants of a nonnegative definite hermitian matrix to other spectral functions. We show that if f is the primitive of a function that is operator monotone on an interval containing the spectrum of a hermitian matrix A, then the function I\mapsto {\rm tr} f(A[I]) is supermodular, meaning that {\rm tr} f(A[I])+{\rm tr} f(A[J])\leq {\rm tr} f(A[I\cup J])+{\rm tr} f(A[I\cap J]), where A[I] denotes the I\times I principal submatrix of A. We discuss extensions to self-adjoint operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert space and to M-matrices. We discuss an application to CUR approximation of nonnegative hermitian matrices.
