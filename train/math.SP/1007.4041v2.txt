We establish wavelet characterizations of homogeneous Besov spaces on stratified Lie groups, both in terms of continuous and discrete wavelet systems.   We first introduce a notion of homogeneous Besov space \dot{B}_{p,q}^s in terms of a Littlewood-Paley-type decomposition, in analogy to the well-known characterization of the Euclidean case. Such decompositions can be defined via the spectral measure of a suitably chosen sub-Laplacian. We prove that the scale of Besov spaces is independent of the precise choice of Littlewood-Paley decomposition. In particular, different sub-Laplacians yield the same Besov spaces.   We then turn to wavelet characterizations, first via continuous wavelet transforms (which can be viewed as continuous-scale Littlewood-Paley decompositions), then via discretely indexed systems. We prove the existence of wavelet frames and associated atomic decomposition formulas for all homogeneous Besov spaces {\dot B}_{p,q}^{s}, with 1 \le p,q < \infty and s \in \mathbb{R}.
