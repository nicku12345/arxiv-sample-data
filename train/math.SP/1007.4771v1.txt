The classical Szego-Weinberger inequality states that among bounded planar domains of given area, the first nonzero Neumann eigenvalue is maximized by a disk. Recently, it was shown by Girouard, Nadirashvili and Polterovich that, for simply connected planar domains of given area, the second nonzero Neumann eigenvalue is maximized in the limit by a sequence of domains degenerating to a disjoint union of two identical disks. We prove that Neumann eigenvalues of planar domains of fixed area are not always maximized by a disjoint union of arbitrary disks. This is an analogue of a result by Wolf and Keller proved earlier for Dirichlet eigenvalues.
