This is a short survey on the connection between general extension theories and the study of realizations of elliptic operators A on smooth domains in R^n, n > 1. The theory of pseudodifferential boundary problems has turned out to be very useful here, not only as a formulational framework, but also for the solution of specific questions. We recall some elements of that theory, and show its application in several cases (including recent results), namely to the lower boundedness question, and the question of spectral asymptotics for differences between resolvents.
