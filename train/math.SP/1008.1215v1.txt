In the scattering theory framework, we consider a pair of operators H_0, H. For a continuous function \phi vanishing at infinity, we set \phi_\delta(\cdot)=\phi(\cdot/\delta) and study the spectrum of the difference \phi_\delta(H-\lambda)-\phi_\delta(H_0-\lambda) for \delta\to0. We prove that if \lambda is in the absolutely continuous spectrum of H_0 and H, then the spectrum of this difference converges to a set that can be explicitly described in terms of (i) the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix S(\lambda) for the pair H_0, H and (ii) the singular values of the Hankel operator H_\phi with the symbol \phi.
