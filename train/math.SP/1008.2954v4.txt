Extremal spectral properties of the Lawson tori are studied. A Lawson torus carries an extremal metric for some eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The main result of this paper is that the number of this eigenvalue is expressed in terms of fundamental tones of auxiliary periodic Sturm-Liouville problems.
