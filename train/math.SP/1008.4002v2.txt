The paper is devoted to the following question: consider two self-adjoint n\times n-matrices H_1,H_2, \|H_1\|\le 1, \|H_2\|\le 1, such that their commutator [H_1,H_2] is small in some sence. Do there exist such self-adjoint commuting matrices A_1,A_2, such that A_i is close to H_i, i=1,2? The answer to this question is positive if the smallness is considered with respect to the operator norm. The following result was established by Huaxin Lin: if \|[H_1,H_2]\|=\delta, then we can choose A_i such that \|H_i-A_i\|\le C(\delta), i=1,2, where C(\delta)\to 0 as \delta\to 0. Notice that C(\delta) does not depend on n. The proof was simplified by Friis and R{\o}rdam. A quantitative version of the result with C(\delta)=E(1/\delta)\delta^{1/5}, where E(x) grows slower than any power of x, was recently established by Hastings. We are interested in the same question, but with respect to the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt norm. An analog of Lin's theorem for this norm was established by Hadwin and independently by Filonov and Safarov. A quantitative version with C(\delta)=12\delta^{1/6}, where \delta=\|[H_1,H_2]\|_{\tr}, was recently obtained by Glebsky. In the present paper, we use the same ideas to prove a similar result with C(\delta)=2\delta^{1/4}. We also refine Glebsky's theorem concerning the case of n operators.
