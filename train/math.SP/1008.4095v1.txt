One dimensional Dirac operators  L_{bc}(v) \, y = i \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0   0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \frac{dy}{dx} + v(x) y, \quad y = \begin{pmatrix} y_1   y_2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad x\in[0,\pi], considered with L^2-potentials  v(x) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & P(x)   Q(x) & 0 \end{pmatrix}  and subject to regular boundary conditions (bc), have discrete spectrum.   For strictly regular bc, it is shown that every eigenvalue of the free operator L^0_{bc} is simple and has the form \lambda_{k,\alpha}^0 = k + \tau_\alpha  where  \; \alpha \in \{1,2\}, \; k \in 2 \mathbb{Z}  and \tau_\alpha =\tau_\alpha (bc); if |k|>N(v, bc)  each of the discs D_k^\alpha = \{z: \; |z-\lambda_{k,\alpha}^0| <\rho =\rho (bc) \} ,  \alpha \in \{1,2\},  contains exactly one simple eigenvalue \lambda_{k,\alpha}  of L_{bc} (v)  and (\lambda_{k,\alpha} -\lambda_{k,\alpha}^0)_{k\in 2\mathbb{Z}}  is an \ell^2 -sequence. Moreover, it is proven that the root projections    P_{n,\alpha} = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\partial D^\alpha_n} (z-L_{bc} (v))^{-1} dz  satisfy the Bari--Markus condition \sum_{|n| > N} \|P_{n,\alpha} - P_{n,\alpha}^0\|^2 < \infty, \quad n \in 2\mathbb{Z},  where P_n^0  are the root projections of the free operator L^0_{bc}. Hence, for strictly regular bc, there is a Riesz basis consisting of root functions (all but finitely many being eigenfunctions). Similar results are obtained for regular but not strictly regular bc -- then in general there is no Riesz basis consisting of root functions but we prove that the corresponding system of two-dimensional root projections is a Riesz basis of projections.
