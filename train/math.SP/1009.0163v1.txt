The paper deals with the semi-classical behaviour of quantum dynamics for a semi-classical completely integrable system with two degrees of freedom near Liouville regular torus. The phenomomenon of wave packet revivals is demonstrated in this article. The framework of this paper is semi-classical analysis (limit :). For the proofs we use standard tools of real analysis, Fourier analysis and basic analytic number theory.
