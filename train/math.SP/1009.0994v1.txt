We prove that for any {\it fixed} trigonometric polynomial potential satisfying a genericity condition, the spectrum of the two dimension periodic Schr\"odinger operator has finite multiplicity and the Fourier series of the eigenfunctions are uniformly exponentially localized about a finite number of frequencies. As a corollary, the L^p norms of the eigenfunctions are bounded for all p>0, which answers a question of Toth and Zelditch \cite{TZ}.
