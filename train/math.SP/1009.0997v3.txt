The spectral behavior of the difference between the resolvents of two realizations \tilde A_1 and \tilde A_2 of a second-order strongly elliptic symmetric differential operator A, defined by different Robin conditions \nu u=b_1\gamma_0u and \nu u=b_2\gamma_0u, can in the case where all coefficients are C^\infty be determined by use of a general result by the author in 1984 on singular Green operators. We here treat the problem for nonsmooth b_i. Using a Krein resolvent formula, we show that if b_1 and b_2 are in L_\infty, the s-numbers s_j of (\tilde A_1 -\lambda)^{-1}-(\tilde A_2 -\lambda)^{-1} satisfy s_j j^{3/(n-1)}\le C for all j; this improves a recent result for A=-\Delta  by Behrndt et al., that \sum_js_j ^p<\infty for p>(n-1)/3. A sharper estimate is obtained when b_1 and b_2 are in C^\epsilon for some \epsilon >0, with jumps at a smooth hypersurface, namely that s_j j^{3/(n-1)}\to c for j\to \infty, with a constant c defined from the principal symbol of A and b_2-b_1.   As an auxiliary result we show that the usual principal spectral asymptotic estimate for pseudodifferential operators of negative order on a closed manifold extends to products of pseudodifferential operators interspersed with piecewise continuous functions.
