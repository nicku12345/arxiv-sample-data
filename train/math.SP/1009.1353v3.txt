Motivated by applications of the discrete random Schr\"odinger operator, mathematical physicists and analysts, began studying more general Anderson-type Hamiltonians; that is, the family of self-adjoint operators H_\omega = H + V_\omega on a separable Hilbert space \mathcal{H}, where the perturbation is given by V_\omega = \sum_n \omega_n (\cdot, \varphi_n)\varphi_n with a sequence \{\varphi_n\}\subset\mathcal{H} and independent identically distributed random variables \omega_n.   We show that the the essential parts of Hamiltonians associated to any two realizations of the random variable are (almost surely) related by a rank one perturbation. This result connects one of the least trackable perturbation problem (with almost surely non-compact perturbations) with one where the perturbation is `only' of rank one perturbations. The latter presents a basic application of model theory.   We also show that the intersection of the essential spectrum with open sets is almost surely either the empty set, or it has non-zero Lebesgue measure.
