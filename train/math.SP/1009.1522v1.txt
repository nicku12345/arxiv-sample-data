We introduce and carefully study a natural probability measure over the numerical range of a complex matrix A \in M_n(\C). This numerical measure \mu_A can be defined as the law of the random variable <AX,X> \in \C when the vector X \in \C^n is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere. If the matrix A is normal, we show that \mu_A has a piecewise polynomial density f_A, which can be identified with a multivariate B-spline. In the general (nonnormal) case, we relate the Radon transform of \mu_A to the spectrum of a family of Hermitian matrices, and we deduce an explicit representation formula for the numerical density which is appropriate for theoretical and computational purposes. As an application, we show that the density f_A is polynomial in some regions of the complex plane which can be characterized geometrically, and we recover some known results about lacunas of symmetric hyperbolic systems in 2+1 dimensions. Finally, we prove under general assumptions that the numerical measure of a matrix A \in M_n(\C) concentrates to a Dirac mass as the size n goes to infinity.
