Let M^\circ be a complete noncompact manifold and g an asymptotically conic Riemaniann metric on M^\circ, in the sense that M^\circ compactifies to a manifold with boundary M in such a way that g becomes a scattering metric on M. Let \Delta be the positive Laplacian associated to g, and P = \Delta + V, where V is a potential function obeying certain conditions. We analyze the asymptotics of the spectral measure dE(\lambda) = (\lambda/\pi i) \big(R(\lambda+i0) - R(\lambda - i0) \big) of P_+^{1/2}, where R(\lambda) = (P - \lambda^2)^{-1}, as \lambda \to 0, in a manner similar to that done previously by the second author and Vasy, and by the first two authors. The main result is that the spectral measure has a simple, `conormal-Legendrian' singularity structure on a space which is obtained from M^2 \times [0, \lambda_0) by blowing up a certain number of boundary faces. We use this to deduce results about the asymptotics of the wave solution operators \cos(t \sqrt{P_+}) and \sin(t \sqrt{P_+})/\sqrt{P_+}, and the Schr\"odinger propagator e^{itP}, as t \to \infty. In particular, we prove the analogue of Price's law for odd-dimensional asymptotically conic manifolds.   This result on the spectral measure has been used in a follow-up work by the authors (arXiv:1012.3780) to prove sharp restriction and spectral multiplier theorems on asymptotically conic manifolds.
