In this article we prove the existence, uniqueness, and simplicity of a negative eigenvalue for a class of integral operators whose kernel is of the form |x-y|^\rho, 0 < \rho \leq 1, x, y \in [-a, a]. We also provide two different ways of producing recursive formulas for the Rayleigh functions (i.e., recursion formulas for power sums) of the eigenvalues of this integral operator when \rho=1, providing means of approximating this negative eigenvalue. These methods offer recursive procedures for dealing with the eigenvalues of a one-dimensional Laplacian with non-local boundary conditions which commutes with an integral operator having a harmonic kernel. The problem emerged in recent work by one of the authors [45]. We also discuss extensions in higher dimensions and links with distance matrices.
