We consider the vibrational energy levels of the first two electronic states of the molecule ion H_2^+. The Born-Oppenheimer method applied to the case of the Stark effect on a H_2^+-like molecule gives existence of sharp resonances localized in the same interval of energy of the vibrational levels.
