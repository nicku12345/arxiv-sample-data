For a bounded planar domain \Omega^0 whose boundary contains a number of flat pieces \Gamma_i we consider a family of non-symmetric billiards \Omega constructed by patching several copies of \Omega^0 along \Gamma_i's. It is demonstrated that the length spectrum of the periodic orbits in \Omega is degenerate with the multiplicities determined by a matrix group G. We study the energy spectrum of the corresponding quantum billiard problem in \Omega and show that it can be split in a number of uncorrelated subspectra corresponding to a set of irreducible representations \alpha of G. Assuming that the classical dynamics in \Omega^0 are chaotic, we derive a semiclassical trace formula for each spectral component and show that their energy level statistics are the same as in standard Random Matrix ensembles. Depending on whether {\alpha} is real, pseudo-real or complex, the spectrum has either Gaussian Orthogonal, Gaussian Symplectic or Gaussian Unitary types of statistics, respectively.
