Let G be \SO(n,1) or \SU(n,1) and let \Gamma\subset G denote an arithmetic lattice. The hyperbolic manifold \Gamma\backslash \calH comes with a natural family of covers, coming from the congruence subgroups of \Gamma. In many applications, it is useful to have a bound for the spectral gap that is uniform for this family. When \Gamma is itself a congruence lattice, there are very good bounds coming from known results towards the Ramanujan conjectures. In this paper, we establish an effective bound that is uniform for congruence subgroups of a non-congruence lattice.
