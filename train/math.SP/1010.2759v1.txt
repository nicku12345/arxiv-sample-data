We give a geometric proof of spectral stability of travelling kink wave solutions to the sine-Gordon equation. For a travelling kink wave solution of speed c \neq \pm 1, the wave is spectrally stable. The proof uses the Maslov index as a means for determining the lack of real eigenvalues. Ricatti equations and further geometric considerations are also used in establishing stability.
