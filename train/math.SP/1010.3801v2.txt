This paper is devoted to a dispersion analysis of a class of perturbed p-Laplacians. Besides the p-Laplacian-like eigenvalue problems we also deal with new and non-standard eigenvalue problems, which can not be solved by the methods used in nonlinear eigenvalue problems for p-Laplacians and similar operators. Original techniques are suggested for solving these new problems (see Section 3). In addition, dispersion relations between the eigen-parameters, quantitative analysis of eigenvectors and variational principles for eigenvalues of perturbed p-Laplacians are also studied in this paper. The problems, we study in this paper arise from the real world problems.
