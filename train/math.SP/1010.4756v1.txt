In this note we give a description of the continuous spectrum of the linearized Euler equations in three dimensions. Namely, for all but countably many times t\in \R, the continuous spectrum of the evolution operator G_t is given by a solid annulus with radii e^{t\mu} and e^{t M}, where \mu and M are the smallest and largest, respectively, Lyapunov exponents of the corresponding bicharacteristic-amplitude system of ODEs.
