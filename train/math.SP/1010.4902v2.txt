We explore the connections between singular Weyl-Titchmarsh theory and the single and double commutation methods. In particular, we compute the singular Weyl function of the commuted operators in terms of the original operator. We apply the results to spherical Schroedinger operators (also known as Bessel operators). We also investigate the connections with the generalized Baecklund-Darboux transformation.
