We consider off-diagonal Jacobi matrices J with (faster-than-exponential) sparse perturbations. We prove (Theorem \ref{onehalf}) that the Fourier transform \hat{\left\| f\right\| ^{2}d\rho}(t) of the spectral measure \rho  of J, whose sparse perturbations are at least separated by a distance \exp \left(cj(\ln j)^{2}\right) /\delta ^{j}, for some c>1/2, 0<\delta <1 and for a dense subset of C_{0}^{\infty}(-2,2)-functions f, decays as t^{-1/2}\Omega (t), uniformly in the spectrum [-2,2], \Omega (t) increasing less rapidly than any positive power of t, improving earlier results obtained by Simon (Commun. Math. Phys. \textbf{179}, 713-722 (1996)) and by Krutikov-Remling (Commun. Math. Phys. \textbf{223}, 509-532 (2001)) for Schr\"{o}dinger operators with sparse potential that increases as fast as exponential-of-exponential. Applications to the spectrum of the Kronecker sum of two (or more) copies of the model are given.
