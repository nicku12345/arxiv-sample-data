Denote by L_D the Sturm-Liouville operator Ly=-y" +q(x)y on the finite interval [0,\pi] with Dirichlet boundary conditions y(0)=y(\pi)=0. Let \{\lambda_k\}_1^\infty and \{\alpha_k\}_1^\infty be the sequences of the eigenvalues and norming constants of this operator. For all \theta \geqslant 0 we study the map F: W_2^{\theta} \to l_D^\theta defined by F(\sigma) =\{s_k\}_1^\infty. Here \sigma= \int q  is the primitive of q, \bold s = \{s_k\}_1^\infty be regularized spectral data defined by s_{2k} =\sqrt{\lambda_k}-k,\ s_{2k-1}=\alpha_k-\pi/2 and l_D^\theta are special Hilbert spaces which are constructed in the paper as finite dimensional extensions of the usual weighted l_2 spaces. We give a complete characterization of the image of this nonlinear operator, show that it is locally invertible analytic map, find explicit form of its Frechet derivative. The main result of the paper are the uniform estimates of the form \|\sigma-\sigma_1\|_\theta \asymp \|\bold s -\bold s_1\|_\theta, provided that the spectral data \bold s and \bold s_1 run through special convex sets in the spaces l_D^\theta.
