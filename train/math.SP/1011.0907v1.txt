This article is about a problem in the numerical analysis of random operators. We study a version of the finite section method for the approximate solution of equations Ax=b in infinitely many variables, where A is a random Jacobi operator. In other words, we approximately solve infinite second order difference equations with stochastic coefficients by reducing the infinite volume case to the (large) finite volume case via a particular truncation technique. For most of the paper we consider non-selfadjoint operators A but we also comment on the self-adjoint case when simplifications occur.
