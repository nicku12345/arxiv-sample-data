Upper bounds are obtained for the heat content of an open set D in a geodesically complete Riemannian manifold M with Dirichlet boundary condition on bd(D), and non-negative initial condition. We show that these upper bounds are close to being sharp if (i) the Dirichlet-Laplace-Beltrami operator acting in L^2(D) satisfies a strong Hardy inequality with weight r^2, (ii) the initial temperature distribution, and the specific heat of D are given by r^{-a} and r^{-b} respectively, where r is the distance to the boundary, and 1<a<2, 1<b<2.
