We present a variant of Mourre's commutator theory. We apply it to prove the limiting absorption principle for Schr\"odinger operators with a perturbed Wigner-Von Neumann potential at suitable energies. To our knowledge, this result is new since we allow a long range pertubation of the Wigner-Von Neumann potential. Furthermore, we can show that the usual Mourre theory, based on differential inequalities and on the generator of dilations, cannot apply to our Schr\"odinger operators.
