The purpose of this paper is to give some refined results about the distribution of resonances in potential scattering. We use techniques and results from one and several complex variables, including properties of functions of completely regular growth. This enables us to find asymptotics for the distribution of resonances in sectors for certain potentials and for certain families of potentials.
