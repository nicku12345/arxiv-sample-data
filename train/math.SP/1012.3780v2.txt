The classical Stein-Tomas restriction theorem is equivalent to the statement that the spectral measure dE(\lambda) of the square root of the Laplacian on \RR^n is bounded from L^p(\RR^n) to L^{p'}(\RR^n) for 1 \leq p \leq 2(n+1)/(n+3), where p' is the conjugate exponent to p, with operator norm scaling as \lambda^{n(1/p - 1/p') - 1}. We prove a geometric generalization in which the Laplacian on \RR^n is replaced by the Laplacian, plus suitable potential, on a nontrapping asymptotically conic manifold, which is the first time such a result has been proven in the variable coefficient setting. It is closely related to, but stronger than, Sogge's discrete L^2 restriction theorem, which is an O(\lambda^{n(1/p - 1/p') - 1}) estimate on the L^p \to L^{p'} operator norm of the spectral projection for a spectral window of fixed length. From this, we deduce spectral multiplier estimates for these operators, including Bochner-Riesz summability results, which are sharp for p in the range above.
