Over a closed manifold, we consider the sectorial projection of an elliptic pseudo-differential operator A of positive order with two rays of minimal growth. We show that it depends continuously on A when the space of pseudo-differential operators is equipped with a certain topology which we explicitly describe. Our main application deals with a continuous curve of arbitrary first order linear elliptic differential operators over a compact manifold with boundary. Under the additional assumption of the weak inner unique continuation property, we derive the continuity of a related curve of Calderon projections and hence of the Cauchy data spaces of the original operator curve.   In the Appendix, we describe a topological obstruction against a verbatim use of R. Seeley's original argument for the complex powers, which was seemingly overlooked in previous studies of the sectorial projection.
