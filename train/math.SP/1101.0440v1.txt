A non-complete \drg \Gamma is called geometric if there exists a set \mathcal{C} of Delsarte cliques such that each edge of \Gamma lies in a unique clique in \mathcal{C}. In this paper, we determine the non-complete distance-regular graphs satisfying \max \{3, 8/3}(a_1+1)\}<k<4a_1+10-6c_2. To prove this result, we first show by considering non-existence of 4-claws that any non-complete distance-regular graph satisfying \max \{3, \8/3}(a_1+1)\}<k<4a_1+10-6c_2 is a geometric \drg with smallest eigenvalue -3. Moreover, we classify the geometric \drg s with smallest eigenvalue -3. As an application, 7 feasible intersection arrays in the list of \cite[Chapter 14]{bcn} are ruled out.
