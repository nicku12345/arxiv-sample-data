This is the proceeding of a talk given in Workshop on Differential Geometry and its applications at Alexandru Ioan Cuza University Ia\c{s}i, Romania, September 2--4, 2009. I explain how positive commutator estimates help in the analysis of embedded eigenvalues in a geometrical setting. Then, I will discuss the disappearance of eigenvalues in the perturbation theory and its relation with the Fermi golden rule.
