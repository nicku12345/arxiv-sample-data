We consider the unperturbed operator H_0: = (-i \nabla - {\bf A})^2 + W, self-adjoint in L^2({\mathbb R}^2). Here {\bf A} is a magnetic potential which generates a constant magnetic field b>0, and the edge potential W = \bar{W} is a {\mathcal T}-periodic non constant bounded function depending only on the first coordinate x \in {\mathbb R} of (x,y) \in {\mathbb R}^2. Then the spectrum \sigma(H_0) of H_0 has a band structure, the band functions are b {\mathcal T}-periodic, and generically there are infinitely many open gaps in \sigma(H_0). We establish explicit sufficient conditions which guarantee that a given band of \sigma(H_0) has a positive length, and all the extremal points of the corresponding band function are non degenerate. Under these assumptions we consider the perturbed operators H_{\pm} = H_0 \pm V where the electric potential V \in L^{\infty}({\mathbb R}^2) is non-negative and decays at infinity. We investigate the asymptotic distribution of the discrete spectrum of H_\pm in the spectral gaps of H_0. We introduce an effective Hamiltonian which governs the main asymptotic term; this Hamiltonian could be interpreted as a 1D Schroedinger operator with infinite-matrix-valued potential. Further, we restrict our attention on perturbations V of compact support. We find that there are infinitely many discrete eigenvalues in any open gap in the spectrum of \sigma(H_0), and the convergence of these eigenvalues to the corresponding spectral edge is asymptotically Gaussian.
