Let M be a strongly pseudoconvex complex manifold which is also the total space of a principal G-bundle with G a Lie group and compact orbit space \bar M/G. Here we investigate the \bar\partial-Neumann Laplacian on M. We show that it is essentially self-adjoint on its restriction to compactly supported smooth forms. Moreover we relate its spectrum to the existence of generalized eigenforms: an energy belongs to \sigma(\square) if there is a subexponentially bounded generalized eigenform for this energy. Vice versa, there is an expansion in terms of these well-behaved eigenforms so that, spectrally, almost every energy comes with such a generalized eigenform.
