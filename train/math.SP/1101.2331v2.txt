A Hardy inequality of the form \[\int_{\tilde{\Omega}} |\nabla f({\bf{x}})|^p d {\bf{x}} \ge (\frac{p-1}{p})^p \int_{\tilde{\Omega}} \{1 + a(\delta, \partial \tilde{\Omega})(\x)\}\frac{|f({\bf{x}})|^p}{\delta({\bf{x}})^p} d{\bf{x}}, \] for all f \in C_0^{\infty}({\tilde{\Omega}}), is considered for p\in (1,\infty), where {\tilde{\Omega}} can be either \Omega or \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \Omega with \Omega a domain in \mathbb{R}^n, n \ge 2, and \delta({\bf{x}}) is the distance from {\bf{x}} \in {\tilde{\Omega}}  to the boundary  \partial {\tilde{\Omega}}. The main emphasis is on determining the dependance of a(\delta, \partial {\tilde{\Omega}}) on the geometric properties of \partial {\tilde{\Omega}}. A Hardy inequality is also established for any doubly connected domain \Omega in \mathbb{R}^2 in terms of a uniformisation of \Omega, that is, any conformal univalent map of \Omega onto an annulus.
