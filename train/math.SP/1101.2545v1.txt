We consider uniformly elliptic operators with Dirichlet or Neumann homogeneous boundary conditions on a domain \Omega  in {\mathbb{R}}^N. We consider deformations \phi (\Omega) of \Omega  obtained by means of a locally Lipschitz homeomorphism \phi  and we estimate the variation of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues upon variation of \phi . We prove general stability estimates without using uniform upper bounds for the gradients of the maps \phi. As an application, we obtain estimates on the rate of convergence for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions when a domain with an outward cusp is approximated by a sequence of Lipschitz domains.
