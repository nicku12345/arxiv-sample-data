Certain many-particle Hardy inequalities are derived in a simple and systematic way using the so-called ground state representation for the Laplacian on a subdomain of \mathbb{R}^n. This includes geometric extensions of the standard Hardy inequalities to involve volumes of simplices spanned by a subset of points. Clifford/multilinear algebra is employed to simplify geometric computations. These results and the techniques involved are relevant for classes of exactly solvable quantum systems such as the Calogero-Sutherland models and their higher-dimensional generalizations, as well as for membrane matrix models, and models of more complicated particle interactions of geometric character.
