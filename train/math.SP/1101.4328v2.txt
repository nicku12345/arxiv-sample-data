The Bethe Strip of width m is the cartesian product \B\times\{1,...,m\}, where \B is the Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). We prove that Anderson models on the Bethe strip have "extended states" for small disorder. More precisely, we consider Anderson-like Hamiltonians \;H_\lambda=\frac12 \Delta \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes A + \lambda \Vv on a Bethe strip with connectivity K \geq 2, where A is an m\times m symmetric matrix, \Vv is a random matrix potential, and \lambda is the disorder parameter. Given any closed interval I\subset (-\sqrt{K}+a_{\mathrm{max}},\sqrt{K}+a_{\mathrm{min}}), where a_{\mathrm{min}} and a_{\mathrm{max}} are the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the matrix A, we prove that for \lambda small the random Schr\"odinger operator \;H_\lambda has purely absolutely continuous spectrum in I with probability one and its integrated density of states is continuously differentiable on the interval I.
