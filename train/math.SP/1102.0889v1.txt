We study the distribution of eigenvalues for non-selfadjoint perturbations of selfadjoint semiclassical analytic pseudodifferential operators in dimension two, assuming that the classical flow of the unperturbed part is completely integrable. An asymptotic formula of Weyl type for the number of eigenvalues in a spectral band, bounded from above and from below by levels corresponding to Diophantine invariant Lagrangian tori, is established. The Weyl law is given in terms of the long time averages of the leading non-selfadjoint perturbation along the classical flow of the unperturbed part.
