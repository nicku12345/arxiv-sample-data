Let n\ge 2 be an integer. Let R_n denote the n\times n tridiagonal matrix with -1's on the sub-diagonal, 1's on the super-diagonal, -1 in the (1,1) entry, 1 in the (n,n) entry and zeros elsewhere. This paper shows that R_n is closely related to a certain circulant matrix and a certain skew-circulant matrix. More precisely, let E_n denote the exchange matrix which is defined by E_n(i,j):=\delta(i+j,n+1). Let E_+ (respectively, E_-) be the projection defined by x\mapsto (1/2)(x + E_n x) (respectively, x\mapsto (1/2)(x - E_n x)). Then R_n = (\pi_n - \pi_n^T) E_+ + (\eta_n - \eta_n^T) E_- , where \pi_n is the basic n\times n circulant matrix and \eta_n is the basic n\times n skew-circulant matrix. In other words, if x is a vector in the range of E_+ then R_n x = (\pi_n - \pi_n^T)x and if x is in the range of E_- then R_n x = (\eta_n - \eta_n^T)x.
