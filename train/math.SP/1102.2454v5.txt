We study a closed unbounded self-adoint operator Q acting on a Hilbert space H in the framework of Metric Abstract Elementary Classes (MAECS). We build a suitable MAEC for (H,Q), prove it is aleph 0 stable up to perturbations and characterize non-splitting and show it has the same properties as non-forking in superstable first order theorues. Also, we characterize equality, orthogonality and domination of (Galois) types in that MAEC.
