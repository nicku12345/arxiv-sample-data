In this paper we propose an iterative algorithm to find out the spectral radius of nonnegative tensors. This algorithm is an extension of the smoothing method for finding the largest eigenvalue of a nonnegative matrix \cite{s14}. For nonnegative irreducible tensors, we establish the converges of the algorithm. Finally we report some numerical results and conclude this paper with some remarks.
