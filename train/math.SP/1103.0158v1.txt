This article concerns the Weyl series of spectral functions associated with the Dirichlet Laplacian in a d-dimensional domain with a smooth boundary. In the case of the heat kernel, Berry and Howls predicted the asymptotic form of the Weyl series characterized by a set of parameters. Here, we concentrate on another spectral function, the (normalized) heat content. We show on several exactly solvable examples that, for even d, the same asymptotic formula is valid with different values of the parameters. The considered domains are d-dimensional balls and two limiting cases of the elliptic domain with eccentricity \epsilon: A slightly deformed disk (\epsilon\to 0) and an extremely prolonged ellipse (\epsilon\to 1). These cases include 2D domains with circular symmetry and those with only one shortest periodic orbit for the classical billiard. We analyse also the heat content for the balls in odd dimensions d for which the asymptotic form of the Weyl series changes significantly.
