The aim of this paper is to study a possible "boundary phenomenon" for Spinc Dirac operators in a special case. If you parametrise Spinc Dirac operators by a family of connections on a Spinc 4-manifold with boundary, this boundary inherits also a family of Spinc Dirac operators which has a spectral section (in the sense of Melrose/Piazza).   We want to analyse this situation concretely for a manifold whose boundary is a 3-torus. For some families of Spinc Dirac operators, we calculate spectrum and eigenbasis and give explicit constructions of spectral sections for small disturbance parameters. We also describe the index of these families in K^1.
