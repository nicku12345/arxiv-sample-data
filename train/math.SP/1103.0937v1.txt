The analytic dilation method was originally used in the context of many body Schr\"odinger operators. In this paper we adapt it to the context of compatible Laplacians on complete manifolds with corners of codimension two. As in the original setting of application we show that the method allows us to: First, meromorphically extend the matrix elements associated to analytic vectors. Second, to prove absence of singular spectrum. Third, to find a discrete set that contains the accumulation points of the pure point spectrum, and finally, it provides a theory of quantum resonances. Apart from these results, we win also a deeper understanding of the essential spectrum of compatible Laplacians on complete manifolds with corners of codimension 2.
