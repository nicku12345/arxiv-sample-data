In this paper we extend classical criteria for determining lower bounds for the least point of the essential spectrum of second-order elliptic differential operators on domains \Omega\subset\R^n allowing for degeneracy of the coefficients on the boundary. We assume that we are given a sesquilinear form and investigate the degree of degeneracy of the coefficients near \partial\Omega that can be tolerated and still maintain a closable sesquilinear form to which the First Representation Theorem can be applied. Then, we establish criteria characterizing the least point of the essential spectrum of the associated differential operator in these degenerate cases. Applications are given for convex and non-convex \Omega using Hardy inequalities, which recently have been proven in terms of the distance to the boundary, showing the spectra to be purely discrete.
