Courant theorem provides an upper bound for the number of nodal domains of eigenfunctions of a wide class of Laplacian-type operators. In particular, it holds for generic eigenfunctions of quantum graph. The theorem stipulates that, after ordering the eigenvalues as a non decreasing sequence, the number of nodal domains \nu_n of the n-th eigenfunction satisfies n\ge \nu_n. Here, we provide a new interpretation for the Courant nodal deficiency d_n = n-\nu_n in the case of quantum graphs. It equals the Morse index --- at a critical point --- of an energy functional on a suitably defined space of graph partitions. Thus, the nodal deficiency assumes a previously unknown and profound meaning --- it is the number of unstable directions in the vicinity of the critical point corresponding to the n-th eigenfunction. To demonstrate this connection, the space of graph partitions and the energy functional are defined and the corresponding critical partitions are studied in detail.
