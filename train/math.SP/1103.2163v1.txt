It is shown the stability of the essential self-adjointness, and an inclusion of the essential spectra of Laplacians under the change of Riemannian metric on a subset K of M. The set K may have infinite volume measured with the new metric and its completion may contain a singular set such as fractal, to which the metric is not extendable.
