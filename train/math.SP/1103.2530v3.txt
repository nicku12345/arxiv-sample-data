Consider the wave equation \partial_t^2u-\Delta_xu+V(t,x)u=0, where x\in\R^n with n\geq3 and V(t,x) is T-periodic in time and decays exponentially in space. Let  U(t,0) be the associated propagator and let R(\theta)=e^{-D<x>}(U(T,0)-e^{-i\theta})^{-1}e^{-D<x>} be the resolvent of the Floquet operator U(T,0) defined for \im(\theta)>BT  with B>0 sufficiently large. We establish a meromorphic continuation of R(\theta) from which we deduce the asymptotic expansion of e^{-(D+\epsilon)<x>}U(t,0)e^{-D<x>}f, where f\in \dot{H}^1(\R^n)\times L^2(\R^n), as t\to+\infty with a remainder term whose energy decays exponentially when n is odd and a remainder term whose energy is bounded with respect to t^l\log(t)^m, with l,m\in\mathbb Z, when n is even. Then, assuming that R(\theta) has no poles lying in \{\theta\in\C\ :\ \im(\theta)\geq0\} and is bounded for \theta\to0, we obtain local energy decay as well as global Strichartz estimates for the solutions of \partial_t^2u-\Delta_xu+V(t,x)u=F(t,x).
