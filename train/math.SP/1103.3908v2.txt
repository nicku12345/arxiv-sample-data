We consider a family of surfaces of revolution, each with a single periodic geodesic which is degenerately unstable. We prove a local smoothing estimate for solutions to the linear Schr\"odinger equation with a loss that depends on the degeneracy, and we construct explicit examples to show our estimate is saturated on a weak semiclassical time scale. As a byproduct of our proof, we obtain a cutoff resolvent estimate with a sharp polynomial loss.
