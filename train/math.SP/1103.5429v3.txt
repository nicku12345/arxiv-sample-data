In this paper, we prove that the distance function of an open connected set in \mathbb R^{n+1} with a C^{2} boundary is superharmonic in the distribution sense if and only if the boundary is {\em weakly mean convex}. We then prove that Hardy inequalities with a sharp constant hold on {weakly mean convex} C^{2} domains. Moreover, we show that the {weakly mean convexity} condition cannot be weakened. We also prove various improved Hardy inequalities on mean convex domains along the line of Brezis-Marcus \cite{BM}.
