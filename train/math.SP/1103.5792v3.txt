Let (G,c) be an infinite network, and let \mathcal{E} be the canonical energy form. Let \Delta_2 be the Laplace operator with dense domain in \ell^2(G) and let \Delta_{\mathcal{E}} be the Laplace operator with dense domain in the Hilbert space \mathcal{H}_\mathcal{E} of finite energy functions on G. It is known that \Delta_2 is essentially self-adjoint, but that \Delta_{\mathcal{E}} is \emph{not}. In this paper, we characterize the Friedrichs extension of \Delta_{\mathcal{E}} in terms of \Delta_2 and show that the spectral measures of the two operators are mutually absolutely continuous with Radon-Nikodym derivative \lambda (the spectral parameter), in the complement of \lambda=0. We also give applications to the effective resistance on (G,c). For transient networks, the Dirac measure at \lambda = 0 contributes to the spectral resolution of the Friedrichs extension of \Delta_{\mathcal{E}} but not to that of the self-adjoint \ell^2 Laplacian.
