Continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes have recently been used widely in the modeling of non-uniformly spaced data and as a tool for dealing with high-frequency data of the form Y_{n\Delta}, n=0,1,2,..., where \Delta is small and positive. Such data occur in many fields of application, particularly in finance and the study of turbulence. This paper is concerned with the characteristics of the process (Y_{n\Delta})_{n\in\bbz}, when \Delta is small and the underlying continuous-time process (Y_t)_{t\in\bbr} is a specified CARMA process.
