We analyze the perturbations T+B of a selfadjoint operator T in a Hilbert space H with discrete spectrum \{t_k \}, T \phi_k = t_k \phi_k, as an extension of our constructions in arXiv: 0912.2722 where T was a harmonic oscillator operator. In particular, if t_{k+1}-t_k \geq c k^{\alpha - 1}, \quad \alpha > 1/2 and \| B \phi_k \| = o(k^{\alpha - 1}) then the system of root vectors of T+B, eventually eigenvectors of geometric multiplicity 1, is an unconditional basis in H.
