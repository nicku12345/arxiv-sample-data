Let f be a Paley-Wiener function in the space L_{2}(X), where X is a symmetric space of noncompact type. It is shown that by using the values of f on a sufficiently dense and separated set of points of X one can give an exact formula for the Helgason-Fourier transform of f. In order to find a discrete approximation to the Helgason-Fourier transform of a function from a Besov space on X we develop an approximation theory by Paley-Wiener functions in L_{2}(X).
