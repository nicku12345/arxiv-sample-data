We investigate the spectral properties of the maximal operator A associated with a differential expression \frac 1 w(-\frac d {dx}(p\frac d {dx}) + q) with real-valued periodic coefficients w, p and q where w changes sign. It turns out that the non-real spectrum of A is bounded, symmetric with respect to the real axis and consists of a finite number of analytic curves. The real spectrum is band-shaped and neither bounded from above nor from below. We characterize the finite spectral singularities of A and prove that there is only a finite number of them. Finally, we provide a condition on the coefficients which ensures that \infty is not a spectral singularity of A.
