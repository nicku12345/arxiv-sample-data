We propose a new method for obtaining Poincare-type inequalities on arbitrary convex bodies in R^n. Our technique involves a dual version of Bochner's formula and a certain moment map, and it also applies to some non-convex sets. In particular, we generalize the central limit theorem for convex bodies to a class of non-convex domains, including the unit balls of L_p-spaces in R^n for 0 < p < 1.
