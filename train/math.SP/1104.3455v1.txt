The construction of "sparse potentials", suggested in \cite{RS09} for the lattice \Z^d,\ d>2, is extended to a wide class of combinatorial and metric graphs whose global dimension is a number D>2. For the Schr\"odinger operator -\D-\a V on such graphs, with a sparse potential V, we study the behavior (as \a\to\infty) of the number N_-(-\D-\a V) of negative eigenvalues of -\D-\a V. We show that by means of sparse potentials one can realize any prescribed asymptotic behavior of N_-(-\D-\a V) under very mild regularity assumptions. A similar construction works also for the lattice \Z^2, where D=2.
