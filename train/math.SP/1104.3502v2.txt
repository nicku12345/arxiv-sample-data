We prove the uniform lower bound for the difference \lambda_2 - \lambda_1 between first two eigenvalues of the fractional Schr\"odinger operator, which is related to the Feynman-Kac semigroup of the symmetric \alpha-stable process killed upon leaving open interval (a,b) \in \R  with symmetric differentiable single-well potential V in the interval (a,b), \alpha \in (1,2). "Uniform" means that the positive constant appearing in our estimate \lambda_2 - \lambda_1 \geq C_{\alpha} (b-a)^{-\alpha} is independent of the potential V. In general case of \alpha \in (0,2), we also find uniform lower bound for the difference \lambda_{*} - \lambda_1, where \lambda_{*} denotes the smallest eigenvalue related to the antisymmetric eigenfunction \phi_{*}. We discuss some properties of the corresponding ground state eigenfunction \phi_1. In particular, we show that it is symmetric and unimodal in the interval (a,b). One of our key argument used in proving the spectral gap lower bound is some integral inequality which is known to be a consequence of the Garsia-Rodemich-Rumsey-Lemma.
