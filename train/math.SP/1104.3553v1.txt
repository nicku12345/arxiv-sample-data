In \cite{AP2} we obtained general estimates of the operator moduli of continuity of functions on the real line. In this paper we improve the estimates obtained in \cite{AP2} for certain special classes of functions.   In particular, we improve estimates of Kato \cite{Ka} and show that  \big\|\,|S|-|T|\,\big\|\le C\|S-T\|\log(2+\log\frac{\|S\|+\|T\|}{\|S-T\|})  for every bounded operators S and T on Hilbert space. Here |S|\df(S^*S)^{1/2}. Moreover, we show that this inequality is sharp.   We prove in this paper that if f is a nondecreasing continuous function on \R that vanishes on (-\be,0] and is concave on [0,\be), then its operator modulus of continuity \O_f admits the estimate  \O_f(\d)\le\const\int_e^\be\frac{f(\d t)\,dt}{t^2\log t},\quad\d>0.    We also study the problem of sharpness of estimates obtained in \cite{AP2} and \cite{AP4}. We construct a C^\be function f on \R such that \|f\|_{L^\be}\le1, \|f\|_{\Li}\le1, and  \O_f(\d)\ge\const\,\d\sqrt{\log\frac2\d},\quad\d\in(0,1].    In the last section of the paper we obtain sharp estimates of \|f(A)-f(B)\| in the case when the spectrum of A has n points. Moreover, we obtain a more general result in terms of the \e-entropy of the spectrum that also improves the estimate of the operator moduli of continuity of Lipschitz functions on finite intervals, which was obtained in \cite{AP2}.
