We prove that if (M, g) is a compact Riemannian manifold with ergodic geodesic flow, and if H \subset M is a smooth hypersurface satisfying a generic asymmetry condition with respect to the geodesic flow, then restrictions \phi_j |_H of an orthonormal basis \{\phi_j\} of \Delta-eigenfunctions of (M, g) to H are quantum ergodic on H. The condition on H is satisfied by geodesic circles, closed horocycles and generic closed geodesics on a hyperbolic surface.
