Under the assumption that V \in L^2([0,\pi]; dx), we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for (non-self-adjoint) Schr\"odinger operators -d^2/dx^2+V in L^2([0,\pi]; dx) with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions to possess a Riesz basis of root vectors (i.e., eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors spanning the range of the Riesz projection associated with the corresponding periodic and antiperiodic eigenvalues). We also discuss the case of a Schauder basis for periodic and antiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators -d^2/dx^2+V in L^p([0,\pi]; dx), p \in (1,\infty).
