An operator H=H_{0}+V where H_{0}=i^{-N} \partial^{N} (N is arbitrary) and V is a differential operator of order N-1 with coefficients decaying sufficiently rapidly at infinity is considered in the space L^2(\Bbb R). The goal of the paper is to find an expression for the trace of the difference of the resolvents (H-z)^{-1} and (H_{0}-z)^{-1} in terms of the Wronskian of appropriate solutions to the differential equation Hu=zu. This also leads to a representation for the perturbation determinant of the pair H_{0}, H.
