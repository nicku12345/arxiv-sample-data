Given a compact Riemannian manifold M, we consider the subspace of L^2(M) generated by the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian of eigenvalue less than L\geq 1. This space behaves like a space of polynomials and we have an analogy with the Paley-Wiener spaces. We study the interpolating and Marcienkiewicz-Zygmund (M-Z) families and provide necessary conditions for sampling and interpolation in terms of the Beurling-Landau densities. As an application, we prove the equidistribution of the Fekete arrays on some compact manifolds.
