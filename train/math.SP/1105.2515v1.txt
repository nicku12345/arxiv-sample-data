In this study, an algorithm for computing the inverse of periodic k banded matrices, which are needed for solving the differential equations by using the finite differences, the solution of partial differential equations and the solution of boundary value problems is obtained and the inverses of periodic anti k banded matrices are computed. In addition, the determinant of these type of matrices and the solution of linear systems having these coefficient matrices are investigated. When obtaining this algorithm, the LU factorization is used.The algorithm is implementable to the CAS (Computer Algebra Systems) such as Maple and Mathematica.
