In the context of a weighted graph with vertex set V and bounded vertex degree, we give a sufficient condition for the essential self-adjointness of the operator \Delta_{\sigma}+W, where \Delta_{\sigma} is the magnetic Laplacian and W\colon V\to\mathbb{R} is a function satisfying W(x)\geq -q(x) for all x\in V, with q\colon V\to [1,\infty). The condition is expressed in terms of completeness of a metric that depends on q and the weights of the graph. The main result is a discrete analogue of the results of I. Oleinik and M. A. Shubin in the setting of non-compact Riemannian manifolds.
