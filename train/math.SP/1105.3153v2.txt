We prove that an integral Cauchy-Riemann inequality holds for any pair of smooth functions (f,h) on the 2-sphere \mathbb{S}^2, and equality holds iff f and h are related \lambda_1-eigenfunctions. We extend such inequality to 4-tuples of functions, only valid on the L^2-orthogonal complement of a suitable nonzero finite dimensional space of functions. As a consequence we prove that 2-spheres are not \Omega-stable surfaces with parallel mean curvature in \mathbb{R}^7 for the associative calibration \Omega.
