We consider semiclassical Schr\"odinger operators on the real line of the form H(\hbar)=-\hbar^2 \frac{d^2}{dx^2}+V(\cdot;\hbar) with \hbar>0 small. The potential V is assumed to be smooth, positive and exponentially decaying towards infinity. We establish semiclassical global representations of Jost solutions f_\pm(\cdot,E;\hbar) with error terms that are uniformly controlled for small E and \hbar, and construct the scattering matrix as well as the semiclassical spectral measure associated to H(\hbar). This is crucial in order to obtain decay bounds for the corresponding wave and Schr\"odinger flows. As an application we consider the wave equation on a Schwarzschild background for large angular momenta \ell where the role of the small parameter \hbar is played by \ell^{-1}. It follows from the results in this paper and \cite{DSS2}, that the decay bounds obtained in \cite{DSS1}, \cite{DS} for individual angular momenta \ell can be summed to yield the sharp t^{-3} decay for data without symmetry assumptions.
