We study the family of compact integral operators \mathbf K_\beta in L^2(\mathbb R) with the kernel K_\beta(x, y) = \frac{1}{\pi}\frac{1}{1 + (x-y)^2 + \beta^2\Theta(x, y)}, depending on the parameter \beta >0, where \Theta(x, y) is a symmetric non-negative homogeneous function of degree \gamma\ge 1. The main result is the following asymptotic formula for the maximal eigenvalue M_\beta of \mathbf K_\beta: M_\beta = 1 - \lambda_1 \beta^{\frac{2}{\gamma+1}} + o(\beta^{\frac{2}{\gamma+1}}), \beta\to 0, where \lambda_1 is the lowest eigenvalue of the operator \mathbf A = |d/dx| + \Theta(x, x)/2. A central role in the proof is played by the fact that \mathbf K_\beta, \beta>0, is positivity improving. The case \Theta(x, y) = (x^2 + y^2)^2 has been studied earlier in the literature as a simplified model of high-temperature superconductivity.
