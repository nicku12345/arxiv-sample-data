The study of the resonances of the Helmholtz resonator has been broadly described in previous works. Here, for a simple tube-shaped two dimensional resonator, we can perform a careful analysis of the transition zone where oscillations start to appear. In that way, we obtain an optimal lower bound of the width of the resonances.
