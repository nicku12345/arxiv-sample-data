The Bethe Strip of width m is the cartesian product \B\times\{1,...,m\}, where \B is the Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). We consider Anderson-like Hamiltonians H_\lambda=\frac12 \Delta \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes A+\lambda \Vv on a Bethe strip with connectivity K \geq 2, where A is an m\times m symmetric matrix, \Vv is a random matrix potential, and \lambda is the disorder parameter. Under certain conditions on A and K, for which we previously proved the existence of absolutely continuous spectrum for small \lambda, we now obtain ballistic behavior for the spreading of wave packets evolving under H_\lambda for small \lambda.
