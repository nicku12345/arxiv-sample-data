We deal with the Sturm--Liouville operator Ly=l(y)=-\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}+q(x)y, with Dirichlet--Neumann boundary conditions  y(0)=y'(\pi)=0  in the space L_2[0,\pi]. We assume that the potential q is complex-valued and has the form q(x)=u'(x), where u\in L_2[0,\pi]. Here the derivative is treated in the distributional sense. Our aim is to obtain the detailed asymptotic formulae for eigenvalues and eigen- and associated functions of the operator L.
