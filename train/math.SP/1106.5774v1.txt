We study the system of root functions (SRF) of Hill operator Ly = -y^{\prime \prime} +vy  with a singular potential v \in H^{-1}_{per} and SRF of 1D Dirac operator  Ly = i {pmatrix} 1 & 0 0 & -1 {pmatrix} \frac{dy}{dx} + vy  with matrix L^2-potential v={pmatrix} 0 & P Q & 0 {pmatrix}, subject to periodic or anti-periodic boundary conditions. Series of necessary and sufficient conditions (in terms of Fourier coefficients of the potentials and related spectral gaps and deviations) for SRF to contain a Riesz basis are proven. Equiconvergence theorems are used to explain basis property of SRF in L^p-spaces and other rearrangement invariant function spaces.
