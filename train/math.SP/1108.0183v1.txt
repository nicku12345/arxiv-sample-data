Let \fre\subset\bbR be a finite union of \ell+1 disjoint closed intervals and denote by \omega_j the harmonic measure of the j leftmost bands. The frequency module for \fre is the set of all integral combinations of \omega_1,..., \omega_\ell. Let \{\tilde{a}_n, \tilde{b}_n\}_{n=1}^\infty be a point in the isospectral torus for \fre and \tilde{p}_n its orthogonal polynomials. Let \{a_n,b_n\}_{n=1}^\infty be a half-line Jacobi matrix with a_n = \tilde{a}_n + \delta a_n, b_n = \tilde{b}_n + \delta b_n. Suppose \[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty %(\abs{a_n-\tilde{a}_n}^2 + \abs{b_n-\tilde{b}_n}^2) <\infty \abs{\delta a_n}^2 + \abs{\delta b_n}^2 <\infty \] and \sum_{n=1}^N e^{2\pi i\omega n} \delta a_n, \sum_{n=1}^N e^{2\pi i\omega n} \delta b_n have finite limits as N\to\infty for all \omega in the frequency module. If, in addition, these partial sums grow at most subexponentially with respect to \omega, then for z\in\bbC\setminus\bbR, p_n(z)/\tilde{p}_n(z) has a limit as n\to\infty. Moreover, we show that there are non-Szeg\H{o} class J's for which this holds.
