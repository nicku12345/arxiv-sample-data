One dimensional Dirac operators  L_{bc}(v) y = i 1 & 0 0 & -1 \frac{dy}{dx} + v(x) y, \quad y = y_1 y_2, \quad x\in[0,\pi], considered with L^2-potentials  v(x) = 0 & P(x) Q(x) & 0 and subject to regular boundary conditions (bc), have discrete spectrum. For strictly regular bc, the spectrum of the free operator  L_{bc}(0)  is simple while the spectrum of  L_{bc}(v)  is eventually simple, and the corresponding normalized root function systems are Riesz bases. For expansions of functions of bounded variation about these Riesz bases, we prove the uniform equiconvergence property and point-wise convergence on the closed interval [0,\pi]. Analogous results are obtained for regular but not strictly regular bc.
