For a two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator H_{\alpha V}=-\Delta-\alpha V with the radial potential V(x)=F(|x|), F(r)\ge 0, we study the behavior of the number N_-(H_{\alpha V}) of its negative eigenvalues, as the coupling parameter \alpha tends to infinity. We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the semi-classical growth N_-(H_{\alpha V})=O(\alpha) and for the validity of the Weyl asymptotic law.
