We develop a general theory for linear stability of traveling waves of second order in time PDE's. More precisely, we introduce an explicitly computable index \om^*\in (0, \infty] (depending on the self-adjoint part of the linearized operator) so that the wave is stable if and only if |c|\geq \om^*. The results are applicable both in the periodic case and in the whole line case. As an application, we consider three classical models - the Boussinesq equation, the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov (KGZ) system and the fourth order beam equation. For the Boussinesq model and the KGZ system (and as a direct application of the main results), we compute explicitly the set of speeds which give rise to linearly stable traveling waves (and for all powers of p in the case of Boussinesq). This result is new for the KGZ system, while it generalizes the results of Alexander-Sachs, which apply to the case p=2. For the beam equation, we provide an explicit formula (depending of the function \|\vp_c'\|_{L^2}), which works for all p and for both the periodic and the whole line cases. Our results complement (and exactly match, whenever they exist) the results of a long line of investigation regarding the related notion of orbital stability of the same waves.
