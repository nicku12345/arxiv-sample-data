We consider a semiclassical asymptotics of local trace for the 3D-Schroedinger operator with self-generated magnetic field; it is given by Weyl expression with O(h^{-1}) error and under standard condition to Hamiltonian trajectories even o(h^{-1}). In comparison to v1,2 errors are corrected, new results are added and more details are provided. Misprint correction in comparison to v3
