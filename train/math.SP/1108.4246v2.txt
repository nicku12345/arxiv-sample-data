The Lieb-Thirring inequalities give a bound on the negative eigenvalues of a Schr\"odinger operator in terms of an L^p norm of the potential. This is dual to a bound on the H^1-norms of a system of orthonormal functions. Here we extend these to analogous inequalities for perturbations of the Fermi sea of non-interacting particles, i.e., for perturbations of the continuous spectrum of the Laplacian by local potentials.
