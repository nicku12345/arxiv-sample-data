We study in this paper properties of functions of perturbed normal operators and develop earlier results obtained in \cite{APPS2}. We study operator Lipschitz and commutator Lipschitz functions on closed subsets of the plane. For such functions we introduce the notions of the operator modulus of continuity and of various commutator moduli of continuity. Our estimates lead to estimates of the norms of quasicommutators f(N_1)R-Rf(N_2) in terms of \|N_1R- RN_2\|, where N_1 and N_2 are normal operator and R is a bounded linear operator. In particular, we show that if 0<\a<1 and f is a H\"older function of order \a, then for normal operators N_1 and N_2,  \|f(N_1)R-Rf(N_2)\|\le\const(1-\a)^{-2}\|f\|_{\L_\a}\|N_1R-RN_2\|^\a\|R\|^{1-\a}.  In the last section we obtain lower estimates for constants in operator H\"older estimates.
