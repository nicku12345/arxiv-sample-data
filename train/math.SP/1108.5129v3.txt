We consider the many-particle quantum mechanics of anyons, i.e. identical particles in two space dimensions with a continuous statistics parameter \alpha \in [0,1] ranging from bosons (\alpha=0) to fermions (\alpha=1). We prove a (magnetic) Hardy inequality for anyons, which in the case that \alpha is an odd numerator fraction implies a local exclusion principle for the kinetic energy of such anyons. From this result, and motivated by Dyson and Lenard's original approach to the stability of fermionic matter in three dimensions, we prove a Lieb-Thirring inequality for these types of anyons.
