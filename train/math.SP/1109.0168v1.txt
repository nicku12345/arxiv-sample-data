We analyze two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with the potential |xy|^p - \lambda (x^2+y^2)^{p/(p+2)} where p\ge 1 and \lambda\ge 0. We show that there is a critical value of \lambda such that the spectrum for \lambda<\lambda_\mathrm{crit} is below bounded and purely discrete, while for \lambda>\lambda_\mathrm{crit} it is unbounded from below. In the subcritical case we prove upper and lower bounds for the eigenvalue sums.
