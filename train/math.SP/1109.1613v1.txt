We develop Weyl-Titchmarsh theory for self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators H_{\alpha} in L^2((a,b);dx;\cH) associated with the operator-valued differential expression \tau =-(d^2/dx^2)+V(\cdot), with V:(a,b)\to\cB(\cH), and \cH a complex, separable Hilbert space. We assume regularity of the left endpoint a and the limit point case at the right endpoint b. In addition, the bounded self-adjoint operator \alpha= \alpha^* \in \cB(\cH) is used to parametrize the self-adjoint boundary condition at the left endpoint a of the type  \sin(\alpha)u'(a)+\cos(\alpha)u(a)=0,  with u lying in the domain of the underlying maximal operator H_{\max} in L^2((a,b);dx;\cH) associated with \tau. More precisely, we establish the existence of the Weyl-Titchmarsh solution of H_{\alpha}, the corresponding Weyl-Titchmarsh m-function m_{\alpha} and its Herglotz property, and determine the structure of the Green's function of H_{\alpha}.   Developing Weyl-Titchmarsh theory requires control over certain (operator-valued) solutions of appropriate initial value problems. Thus, we consider existence and uniqueness of solutions of 2nd-order differential equations with the operator coefficient V, -y" + (V - z) y = f \, \text{on} \, (a,b), y(x_0) = h_0, \; y'(x_0) = h_1, under the following general assumptions: (a,b)\subseteq\bbR is a finite or infinite interval, x_0\in(a,b), z\in\bbC, V:(a,b)\to\cB(\cH) is a weakly measurable operator-valued function with \|V(\cdot)\|_{\cB(\cH)}\in L^1_\loc((a,b);dx), and f\in L^1_{\loc}((a,b);dx;\cH), with \cH a complex, separable Hilbert space. We also study the analog of this initial value problem with y and f replaced by operator-valued functions Y, F \in \cB(\cH).   Our hypotheses on the local behavior of V appear to be the most general ones to date.
