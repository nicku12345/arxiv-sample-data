We provide a proof of the conjecture formulated in \cite{Jak97,JNT01} which states that on a n-dimensional flat torus \T^{n}, the Fourier transform of squares of the eigenfunctions |\phi_\lambda|^2 of the Laplacian have uniform l^n bounds that do not depend on the eigenvalue \lambda. The proof is a generalization of the argument by Jakobson, {\it et al}. for the lower dimensional cases. These results imply uniform bounds for semiclassical limits on \TT^{n+2}. We also prove a geometric lemma that bounds the number of codimension-one simplices which satisfy a certain restriction on an n-dimensional sphere S^n(\lambda) of radius \sqrt{\lambda} and use it in the proof.
