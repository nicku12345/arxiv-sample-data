We extend the classical Mercer theorem to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces whose elements are functions from a measurable space Xinto \mathbb C^n. Given a finite measure \mu on X, we represent the reproducing kernel K as convergent series in terms of the eigenfunctions of a suitable compact operator depending on K and \mu. Our result holds under the mild assumption that K is measurable and the associated Hilbert space is separable. Furthermore, we show that X has a natural second countable topology with respect to which the eigenfunctions are continuous and the series representing K uniformly converges to K on any compact subsets of X\times X, provided that the support of \mu is X.
