In this paper we define the analytic torsion for a complete oriented hyperbolic manifold of finite volume. It depends on a representation of the fundamental group. For manifolds of odd dimension, we study the asymptotic behavior of the analytic torsion with respect to certain sequences of representations obtained by restriction of irreducible representations of the group of isometries of the hyperbolic space to the fundamental group.
