Denote by w(A) the numerical radius of a bounded linear operator A acting on Hilbert space. Suppose that A is invertible and that the numerical radius of A and of its inverse are no greater than 1+e for some non-negative e. It is shown that the distance of A from unitary operators is less or equal than a constant times e^{1/4}. This generalizes a result due to J.G. Stampfli, which is obtained for e = 0. An example is given showing that the exponent 1/4 is optimal. The more general case of the operator \rho-radius is discussed for \rho between 1 and 2.
