We study the manner in which spectral shift functions associated with self-adjoint one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators on the finite interval (0,R) converge in the infinite volume limit R\to\infty to the half-line spectral shift function.   Relying on a Fredholm determinant approach combined with certain measure theoretic facts, we show that prior vague convergence results in the literature in the special case of Dirichlet boundary conditions extend to the notion of weak convergence and arbitrary separated self-adjoint boundary conditions at x=0 and x=R.
