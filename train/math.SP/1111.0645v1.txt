We provide a detailed description of the model Hilbert space L^2(\bbR; d\Sigma; \cK), were \cK represents a complex, separable Hilbert space, and \Sigma denotes a bounded operator-valued measure. In particular, we show that several alternative approaches to such a construction in the literature are equivalent.   These spaces are of fundamental importance in the context of perturbation theory of self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators, and the spectral theory of ordinary differential operators with operator-valued coefficients.
