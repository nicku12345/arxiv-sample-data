This paper is devoted to the study of Lifshitz tails for a continuous matrix-valued Anderson-type model H_{\omega} acting on L^2(\R^d)\otimes \C^{D}, for arbitrary d\geq 1 and D\geq 1. We prove that the integrated density of states of H_{\omega} has a Lifshitz behavior at the bottom of the spectrum. We obtain a Lifshitz exponent equal to -d/2 and this exponent is independent of D. It shows that the behaviour of the integrated density of states at the bottom of the spectrum of a quasi-d-dimensional Anderson model is the same as its behaviour for a d-dimensional Anderson model.
