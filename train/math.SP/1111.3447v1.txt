Let G be a bounded region with simply connected closure and having analytic boundary and let mu be a positive measure carried by the closure of G together with finitely many pure points outside G. We provide estimates on the norms of the monic polynomials of minimal norm in the space L^q(mu) for q>0. In case the norms converge to 0, we provide estimates on the rate of convergence, generalizing several previous results. Our most powerful result concerns measures mu that are perturbations of measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to the push-forward of a product measure near the boundary of the unit disk. Our results and methods also yield information about the strong asymptotics of the extremal polynomials and some information concerning Christoffel functions.
