In this work we consider semi-classical Schr\"odinger operators with potentials supported in a bounded strictly convex subset {\cal O} of {\bf R}^n with smooth boundary. Letting h denote the semi-classical parameter, we consider certain classes of small random perturbations and show that with probability very close to 1, the number of resonances in rectangles [a,b]-i[0,ch^{2/3}[, is equal to the number of eigenvalues in [a,b] of the Dirichlet realization of the unperturbed operator in {\cal O} up to a small remainder.
