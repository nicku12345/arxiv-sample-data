Let H signify the free non-negative Laplacian on \mathbb{R}^2 and H_Y the non-negative Dirichlet Laplacian on the complement Y of a nonpolar compact subset K in the plane. We derive the low-energy expansion for the Krein spectral shift function (scattering phase) for the obstacle scattering system \{\,H_Y,\,H\,\} including detailed expressions for the first three coefficients. We use this to investigate the large time behaviour of the expected volume of the pinned Wiener sausage associated to K.
