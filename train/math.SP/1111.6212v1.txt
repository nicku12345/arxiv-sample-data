In Boundary Element Method, Green's function with no boundary conditions is used for solving Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary condition. To determine the gradient of solution on the boundary, we need to solve the boundary integral equation numerically in most practical cases. Here we discuss the alternative method to avert solving that boundary integral equation. It is based on the solution for Poisson's equation which has the singularity on the boundary specified by the boundary function and shown it is applicable to arbitrary shaped domain and reduces calculation cost considerably.
