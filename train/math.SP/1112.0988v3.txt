Avila recently introduced a new method for the study of the discrete Schr\"odinger Operator with limit periodic potential. I adapt this method to the context of orthogonal polynomials in the unit circle with limit periodic Verblunsky Coefficients. Specifically, I represent these Verblunsky Coefficients as a continuous sampling of the orbits of a Cantor group by a minimal translation. I then investigate the measures that arise on the unit circle as I vary the sampling function.
