We study the variation of the discrete spectrum of a bounded non-negative operator in a Krein space under a non-negative Schatten class perturbation of order p. It turns out that there exist so-called extended enumerations of discrete eigenvalues of the unperturbed and the perturbed operator, respectively, whose difference is an \ell^p-sequence. This result is a Krein space version of a theorem by T.Kato for bounded selfadjoint operators in Hilbert spaces.
