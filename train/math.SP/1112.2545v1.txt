We give an abstract definition of a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger   operator with \delta'-interaction on an arbitrary set~\Gamma of   Lebesgue measure zero. The number of negative eigenvalues of such an   operator is at least as large as the number of those isolated points   of the set~\Gamma that have negative values of the intensity   constants of the \delta'-interaction. In the case where the   set~\Gamma is endowed with a Radon measure, we give constructive   examples of such operators having an infinite number of negative eigenvalues.
