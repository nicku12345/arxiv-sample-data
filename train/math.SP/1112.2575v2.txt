The thermodynamic limit of the internal energy and the entropy of the system of quantum interacting particles in random medium is shown to exist under the crucial requirements of stability and temperedness of interactions. The energy turns out to be proportional to the number of particles and/or volume of the system in the thermodynamic limit. The obtained results require very general assumptions on the random one-particle model. The methods are mainly based on subadditive type inequalities.
