The spectral properties of a class of non-selfadjoint second order elliptic operators with indefinite weight functions on unbounded domains \Omega are investigated. It is shown that under an abstract regularity assumption the nonreal spectrum of the associated elliptic operator in L^2(\Omega) is bounded. In the special case that \Omega=R^n decomposes into subdomains \Omega_+ and \Omega_- with smooth compact boundaries and the weight function is positive on \Omega_+ and negative on \Omega_-, it turns out that the nonreal spectrum consists only of normal eigenvalues which can be characterized with a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.
