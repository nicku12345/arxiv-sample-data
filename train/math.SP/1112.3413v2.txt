Let S(k) be the scattering matrix for a Schr\"odinger operator (Laplacian plus potential) on \RR^n with compactly supported smooth potential. It is well known that S(k) is unitary and that the spectrum of S(k) accumulates on the unit circle only at 1; moreover, S(k) depends analytically on k and therefore its eigenvalues depend analytically on k provided the values stay away from 1.   We give examples of smooth, compactly supported potentials on \RR^n for which (i) the scattering matrix S(k) does not have 1 as an eigenvalue for any k > 0, and (ii) there exists k_0 > 0 such that there is an analytic eigenvalue branch e^{2i\delta(k)} of S(k) converging to 1 as k \downarrow k_0. This shows that the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix, as a function of k, do not necessarily have continuous extensions to or across the value 1. In particular this shows that a `micro-Levinson theorem' for non-central potentials in \RR^3 claimed in a 1989 paper of R. Newton is incorrect.
