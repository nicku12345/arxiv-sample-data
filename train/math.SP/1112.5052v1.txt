In this paper, a rigorous computational method to enclose eigendecompositions of complex interval matrices is proposed. Each eigenpair x=(\lambda,v) is found by solving a nonlinear equation of the form f(x)=0 via a contraction argument. The set-up of the method relies on the notion of radii polynomials, which provide an efficient mean of determining a domain on which the contraction mapping theorem is applicable.
