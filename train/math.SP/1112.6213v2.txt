Let (M,g) be a n-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold. We consider the magnetic deformations of semiclassical Schrodinger operators on M for a family of magnetic potentials that depends smoothly on k parameters u, for k \geq n, and satisfies a generic admissibility condition. Define the deformed Schrodinger eigenfunctions to be the u-parametrized semiclassical family of functions on M that is equal to the unitary magnetic Schrodinger propagator applied to the Schrodinger eigenfunctions. The main result of this article states that the L^2 norms in u of the deformed Schrodinger eigenfunctions are bounded above and below by constants, uniformly on M and in \hbar. In particular, the result shows that this non-random perturbation "kills" the blow-up of eigenfunctions. We give, as applications, an eigenfunction restriction bound and a quantum ergodicity result.
