In this paper we consider ensemble of random matrices \X_n with independent identically distributed vectors (X_{ij}, X_{ji})_{i \neq j} of entries. Under assumption of finite fourth moment of matrix entries it is proved that empirical spectral distribution of eigenvalues converges in probability to a uniform distribution on the ellipse. The axis of the ellipse are determined by correlation between X_{12} and X_{21}. This result is called Elliptic Law. Limit distribution doesn't depend on distribution of matrix elements and the result in this sence is universal.
