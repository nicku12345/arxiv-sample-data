For a two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator H_{\alpha V}=-\Delta-\alpha V,\ V\ge 0, we study the behavior of the number N_-(H_{\alpha V}) of its negative eigenvalues (bound states), as the coupling parameter \alpha tends to infinity. A wide class of potentials is described, for which N_-(H_{\alpha V}) has the semi-classical behavior, i.e., N_-(H_{\alpha V})=O(\alpha). For the potentials from this class, the necessary and sufficient condition is found for the validity of the Weyl asymptotic law.
