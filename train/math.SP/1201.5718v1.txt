We introduce two entire functions f_{A_{1/2\infty}}and f_{D_{1/2\infty}} in two variables. Both of them have only two critical values 0 and 1, and the associated maps \C^2 to \C define topologically locally trivial fibrations over \C\setminus{0,1\}. All critical points are ordinary double points, and the associated vanishing cycles span the middle homology group of the general fiber, whose intersection diagram forms bi-partitely decomposed quivers of type A_{1/2\infty} and D_{1/2\infty}, respectively. Coxeter elements of type A_{1/2\infty} and D_{1/2\infty}, acting on the middle homology group, are introduced as the product of the monodromies around 0 and 1. We describe the spectra of the Coxeter elements by embedding the middle homology group into a Hilbert space. The spectra turn out to be strongly continuous on the interval (-1/2,1/2) except at 0 for type \DD.
