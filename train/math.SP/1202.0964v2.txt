Let G be a graph of order n, and let q_{1}(G) \geq ...\geq q_{n}(G)  be the eigenvalues of the Q-matrix of G, also known as the signless Laplacian of G. In this paper we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the equality q_{k}(G) =n-2, where 1<k\leq n. In particular, this result solves an open problem raised by Wang, Belardo, Huang and Borovicanin.   We also show that [ q_{2}(G) \geq\delta(G)] and determine that equality holds if and only if G is one of the following graphs: a star, a complete regular multipartite graph, the graph K_{1,3,3}, or a complete multipartite graph of the type K_{1,...,1,2,...,2}.
