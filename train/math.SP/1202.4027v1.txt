Let X be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension two or three and let P be a point of X. We derive comparison formulas relating the zeta-regularized determinant of an arbitrary self-adjoint extension of (symmetric) Laplace operator with domain, consisting of smooth functions with compact supports which does not contain P, to the zeta-regularized determinant of the self-adjoint Laplacian on X.
