Let G be a connected, real, semisimple Lie group with finite center, and K a maximal compact subgroup of G. In this paper, we derive K-equivariant asymptotics for heat traces with remainder estimates on compact Riemannian manifolds carrying a transitive and isometric G-action. In particular, we compute the leading coefficient in the Minakshishundaram-Pleijel expansion of the heat trace for Bochner-Laplace operators on homogeneous vector bundles over compact locally symmetric spaces of arbitrary rank.
