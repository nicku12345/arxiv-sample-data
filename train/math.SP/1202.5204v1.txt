We study perturbations of a self-adjoint positive operator T, provided that a perturbation operator B satisfies "local" subordinate condition \|B\varphi_k\|\leqslant b\mu_k^{\beta} with some \beta <1 and b>0. Here \{\varphi_k\}_{k=1}^\infty is an orthonormal system of the eigenvectors of the operator T corresponding to the eigenvalues \{\mu_k\}_{k=1}^\infty. We introduce the concept of \alpha-non-condensing sequence and prove the theorem on the comparison of the eigenvalue-counting functions of the operators T and T+B. Namely, it is shown that if \{\mu_k\} is \alpha-non-condensing then the difference of the eigenvalue-counting functions is subject to relation   |n(r,\, T)- n(r,\, T+B)| \leqslant C[n(r+ar^\gamma,\, T) - n(r-ar^\gamma,\, T)] +C_1    with some constants C, C_1, a and \gamma = \max(0, \beta, 2\beta+\alpha-1)\in [0,1).
