This mini-course of 20 lectures aims at highlights of spectral theory for self-adjoint partial differential operators, with a heavy emphasis on problems with discrete spectrum. Part I: Discrete Spectrum (ODE preview, Laplacian - computable spectra, Schroedinger - computable spectra, Discrete spectral theorem via sesquilinear forms, Laplace eigenfunctions, Natural boundary conditions, Magnetic Laplacian, Schroedinger in confining well, Variational characterizations, Monotonicity of eigenvalues, Weyl's asymptotic, Polya's conjecture, Reaction-diffusion stability, Thin fluid film stability) Part II: Continuous Spectrum (Laplacian on whole space, Schroedinger with -2sech^2 potential, Selfadjoint operators, Spectra: discrete and continuous, Discrete spectrum revisited)
