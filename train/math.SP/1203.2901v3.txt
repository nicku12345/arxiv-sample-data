We consider two dimensional real-valued analytic potentials for the Schr\"odinger equation which are periodic over a lattice L. Under certain assumptions on the form of the potential and the lattice L, we can show there is a large class of analytic potentials which are Floquet rigid and dense in the set of C^\infty(R^2/L) potentials. The result extends the work of Eskin et. al, in "On isospectral periodic potentials in R^n, II."
