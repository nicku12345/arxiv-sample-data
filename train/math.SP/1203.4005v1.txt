A discrete analogue of a Schrodinger type operator proposed by J. Bellissard has a singular continuous spectrum. In this remark we answer the conjecture formulated by D. Bessis, M. Mehta and P. Moussa on the coefficients of that operator. It turns out that the coefficients have a more complicated behavior than it was conjectured.
