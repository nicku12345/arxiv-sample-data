Let X be a convex co-compact hyperbolic surface and let \delta be the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of the underlying discrete group. We show that the density of the resonances of the Laplacian in strips {\sigma\leq \re(s) \leq \delta} with |\im(s)| \leq T is less than O(T^{1+\delta-\epsilon(\sigma)}) with \epsilon>0 as long as \sigma>\delta/2. This improves the fractal Weyl upper bounds of Zworski and supports numerical results obtained for various models of quantum chaotic scattering.
