Antilinear operators on a complex Hilbert space arise in various contexts in mathematical physics. In this paper, an analogue of the Weyl--von Neumann theorem for antilinear self-adjoint operators is proved, i.e. that an antilinear self-adjoint operator is the sum of a diagonalizable operator and of a compact operator with arbitrarily small Schatten p-norm. In doing so, we discuss conjugations and their properties. A spectral integral representation for antilinear self-adjoint operators is constructed.
