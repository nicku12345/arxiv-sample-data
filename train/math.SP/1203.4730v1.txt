The paper is devoted to optimization of resonances for Krein strings with total mass and statical moment constraints. The problem is to design for a given \alpha \in \R a string that has a resonance on the line \alpha + \i \R with a minimal possible modulus of the imaginary part. We find optimal resonances and strings explicitly.
