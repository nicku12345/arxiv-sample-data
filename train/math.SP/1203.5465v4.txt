Under several geometric conditions imposed below, the existence of the discrete spectrum below the essential spectrum is shown for the Dirichlet Laplacian on the quantum layer built over a spherically symmetric hypersurface with a pole embedded in the Euclidean space R4. At the end of this paper, we also show the advantage and independence of our main result comparing with those existent results for higher dimensional quantum layers or quantum tubes.
