We introduce a new geometric characteristic of compact sets on the plane called r-convexity, which fits nicely into the concept of generalized convexity and extends essentially the conventional convexity. For a class of subharmonic functions on unbounded domains with r-convex compact complement, with the growth governed by the distance to the boundary, we obtain the Blaschke--type condition for their Riesz measures. The result is applied to the study of the convergence of the discrete spectrum for the Schatten--von Neumann perturbations of bounded linear operators in the Hilbert space.
