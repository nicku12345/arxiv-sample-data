We examine the operator U_5 defined on L^2(\mu_{\frac14}) where \mu_{\frac14} is the 1/4 Cantor measure. The operator U_5 scales the elements of the canonical exponential spectrum for L^2(\mu_{\frac14}) by 5 --- that is, Ue_{\gamma} = e_{5\gamma} where e_{\gamma}(t) = e^{2\pi i \gamma t}. It is known that U_5 has a self-similar structure, which makes its spectrum, which is currently unknown, of particular interest. In order to better understand the spectrum of U_5, we demonstrate a decomposition of the projection valued measures and scalar spectral measures associated with U_5. We are also able to compute associated Radon-Nikodym derivatives between the scalar measures. Our decomposition utilizes a system of operators which form a representation of the Cuntz algebra \mathcal{O}_2.
