In this paper we develop tools to study families of non-selfadjoint operators L(\varphi), \varphi \in P, characterized by the property that the spectrum of L(\varphi) is (partially) simple. As a case study we consider the Zakharov-Shabat operators L(\varphi) appearing in the Lax pair of the focusing NLS on the circle. The main result says that the set of potentials \varphi  of Sobolev class H^N, N \geq 0, so that all small eigenvalues of L(\varphi) are simple, is path connected and dense.
