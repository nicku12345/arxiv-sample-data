We develop the foundation of the spectral analysis on Barlow-Evans projective limit fractals, or vermiculated spaces, which corresponds to symmetric Markov processes on these spaces. For some new examples, such as the generalized Laakso spaces and a Spierpinski P\^ate \`a Choux, one can develop a complete spectral theory, including the eigenfunction expansions that are analogous to Fourier series. Also, one can construct connected fractal spaces isospectral to the fractal strings of Lapidus and van Frankenhuijsen. Our work is motivated by recent progress in mathematical physics on fractals.
