We prove that on any compact manifold M^n with boundary, there exist a conformal class C such that for any riemannian metric g\in C, \lambda_1(M^n,g)Vol(M^n,g)^{2/n}< n.Vol(S^n,g_{\textrm{can}})^{2/n} and \sigma_1(M,g,\rho)\mathcal M(\partial M)Vol(M)^{\frac{2-n}n}<n.Vol(S^n,g_{\textrm{can}})^{2/n}, where \lambda_1(M^n,g) denotes the first positive eigenvalue of the Neumann laplacian on (M,g), \sigma_1(M,g,\rho) the first positive Steklov eigenvalue for the density \rho on \partial M, and \mathcal M(\partial M)=\int_{\partial M}\rho dv_g. The proof relies on a handle decomposition of the manifold. We also prove that the conformal volume of (M,C) is Vol(S^n,g_{\textrm{can}}), and that the Friedlander-Nadirashvili and the M\"obius volume of M are equal to those of the sphere. If M is a domain in a space form, C is the conformal class of the canonical metric.
