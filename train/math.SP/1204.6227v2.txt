In this paper, we are interested in the free Jacobi process starting at the unit of the compressed probability space where it takes values and associated with the parameter values \lambda=1, \theta =1/2. Firstly, we derive a time-dependent recurrence equation for the moments of the process (valid for any starting point and all parameter values). Secondly, we transform this equation to a nonlinear partial differential one for the moment generating function that we solve when \lambda = 1, \theta =1/2. The obtained solution together with tricky computations lead to an explicit expression of the moments which shows that the free Jacobi process is distributed at any time t as (1/4)(2+Y_{2t}+Y_{2t}^{\star}) where Y is a free unitary Brownian motion. This expression is recovered relying on enumeration techniques after proving that if a is a symmetric Bernoulli random variable which is free from \{Y, Y^{\star}\}, then the distributions of Y_{2t} and that of aY_taY_t^{\star} coincide. We close the exposition by investigating the spectral distribution associated with general sets of parameter values.
