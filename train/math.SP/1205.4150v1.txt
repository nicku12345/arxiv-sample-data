We prove uniform Sobolev estimates ||u||_{L^{p'}} \leq C ||(\Delta-\alpha)u||_{L^{p}}, where p=2n/(n+2), p'=2n/(n-2), for the Laplacian \Delta on non-trapping asymptotically conic manifolds of dimension n. Here C is independent of \alpha which ranges over all complex numbers. This generalizes to non-constant coefficient Laplacians a result of Kenig-Ruiz-Sogge.
