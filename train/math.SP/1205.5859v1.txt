The Spectral Excess Theorem (SPET) for distance-regular graphs states that a regular (connected) graph is distance-regular if and only if its spectral-excess equals its average excess. Recently, some local or global approaches to the SPET have been used to obtain new versions of the theorem for nonregular graphs, and also to study the problem of characterizing the graphs which have the corresponding distance-regularity property. In this paper, some of these versions are related and compared, and some of their results are improved. As a result, a sufficient condition for a graph to be distance-polynomial is obtained.
