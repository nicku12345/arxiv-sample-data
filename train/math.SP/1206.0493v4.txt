We study a class of generalized Riesz products connected to the spectral type of some class of rank one flows on \R. Applying a Central Limit Theorem of Kac, we exhibit a large class of singular generalized Riesz products on the Bohr compactification of \R. Moreover, we discuss the problem of the flat polynomials in this setting.
