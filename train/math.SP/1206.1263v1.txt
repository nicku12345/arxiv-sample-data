We study Schr\"{o}dinger operators on star metric graphs with potentials of the form \alpha\varepsilon^{-2}Q(\varepsilon^{-1}x). In dimension 1 such potentials, with additional assumptions on Q, approximate in the sense of distributions as \varepsilon\to0 the first derivative of the Dirac delta-function. We establish the convergence of the Schr\"{o}dinger operators in the uniform resolvent topology and show that the limit operator depends on \alpha and Q in a very nontrivial way.
