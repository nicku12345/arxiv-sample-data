The goal of this paper is to study the Dirichlet eigenvalues of bounded domains \Omega\subset \Omega'. With a local spectral stability requirement on \Omega, we show that the difference of the Dirichlet eigenvalues of \Omega' and \Omega is explicitly controlled from above in terms of the first eigenvalue of \Omega'\setminus\bar{\Omega} and of geometric constants depending on the inner domain \Omega. In particular, \Omega' can be an arbitrary bounded domain.
