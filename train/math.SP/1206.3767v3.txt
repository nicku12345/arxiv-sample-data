We study resolvents and spectral projections for quadratic differential operators under an assumption of partial ellipticity. We establish exponential-type resolvent bounds for these operators, including Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators with quadratic potentials. For the norms of spectral projections for these operators, we obtain complete asymptotic expansions in dimension one, and for arbitrary dimension, we obtain exponential upper bounds and the rate of exponential growth in a generic situation. We furthermore obtain a complete characterization of those operators with orthogonal spectral projections onto the ground state.
