The Hill operators Ly=-y"+v(x)y, considered with complex valued \pi-periodic potentials v and subject to periodic, antiperiodic or Neumann boundary conditions have discrete spectra. For sufficiently large n, close to n^2 there are two periodic (if n is even) or antiperiodic (if n is odd) eigenvalues \lambda_n^-, \lambda_n^+ and one Neumann eigenvalue \nu_n. We study the geometry of "the spectral triangle" with vertices (\lambda_n^+,\lambda_n^-,\nu_n), and show that the rate of decay of triangle size characterizes the potential smoothness. Moreover, it is proved, for v\in L^p ([0,\pi]), \; p>1, that the set of periodic (antiperiodic) root functions contains a Riesz basis if and only if for even n (respectively, odd n)  \; \sup_{\lambda_n^+\neq \lambda_n^-}\{|\lambda_n^+-\nu_n|/|\lambda_n^+-\lambda_n^-| \} < \infty.
