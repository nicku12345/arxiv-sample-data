In this paper, the perturbation problems of A_{T,S}^{(2)} are considered. By virtue of the gap between subspaces, we derive the conditions that make the perturbation of A_{T,S}^{(2)} is stable when T,S and A have suitable perturbations. At the same time, the explicit formulas for perturbation of A_{T,S}^{(2)} and new results on perturbation bounds are obtained.
