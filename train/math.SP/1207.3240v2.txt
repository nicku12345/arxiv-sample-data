The absolute change in the Rayleigh quotient (RQ) is bounded in this paper in terms of the norm of the residual and the change in the vector. If x is an eigenvector of a self-adjoint bounded operator A in a Hilbert space, then the RQ of the vector x, denoted by \rho(x), is an exact eigenvalue of A. In this case, the absolute change of the RQ |\rho(x)-\rho(y)| becomes the absolute error in an eigenvalue \rho(x) of A approximated by the RQ \rho(y) on a given vector y. There are three traditional kinds of bounds of the eigenvalue error: a priori bounds via the angle between vectors x and y; a posteriori bounds via the norm of the residual Ay-\rho(y)y of vector y; mixed type bounds using both the angle and the norm of the residual. We propose a unifying approach to prove known bounds of the spectrum, analyze their sharpness, and derive new sharper bounds. The proof approach is based on novel RQ vector perturbation identities.
