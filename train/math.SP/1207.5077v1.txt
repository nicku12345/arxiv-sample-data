We discuss Schr\"odinger operators on a half-line with decaying oscillatory potentials, such as products of an almost periodic function and a decaying function. We provide sufficient conditions for preservation of absolutely continuous spectrum and give bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of the singular part of the spectral measure. We also discuss the analogs for orthogonal polynomials on the real line and unit circle.
