We exhibit d-dimensional limit-periodic Schrodinger operators that are uniformly localized in the strongest sense possible. That is, for each of these operators, there is a uniform exponential decay rate such that every element of the hull of the corresponding Schrodinger operator has a complete set of eigenvectors that decay exponentially off their centers of localization at least as fast as prescribed by the uniform decay rate. Consequently, these operators exhibit uniform dynamical localization.
