We prove a two-term asymptotic expansion of eigenvalue sums of the Laplacian on a bounded domain with Neumann, or more generally, Robin boundary conditions. We formulate and prove the asymptotics in terms of semi-classical analysis. In this reformulation it is natural to allow the function describing the boundary conditions to depend on the semi-classical parameter and we identify and analyze three different regimes for this dependence.
