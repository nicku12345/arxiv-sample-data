This work starts with the introduction of a family of differential energy operators. Energy operators (Psi_R^+, Psi_R^-) were defined together with a method to decompose the wave equation in a previous work. Here the energy operators are defined following the order of their derivatives (Psi_k^+, Psi_k^-, k = {0,1,2,..}). The main part of the work is to demonstrate that for any smooth real-valued function f in the Schwartz space (S^-(R)), the successive derivatives of the n-th power of f (n in Z and n not equal to 0) can be decomposed using only Psi_k^+ (Lemma) or with Psi_k^+, Psi_k^- (k in Z) (Theorem) in a unique way (with more restrictive conditions). Some properties of the Kernel and the Image of the energy operators are given along with the development. Finally, the paper ends with the application to the energy function.
