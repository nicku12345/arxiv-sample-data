We give a sharp polynomial bound on the number of Pollicott-Ruelle resonances. These resonances, which are complex numbers in the lower half-plane, appear in expansions of correlations for Anosov contact flows. The bounds follow the tradition of upper bounds on the number of scattering resonances and improve a recent bound of Faure-Sj\"ostrand. The complex scaling method used in scattering theory is replaced by an approach using exponentially weighted spaces introduced by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand in scattering theory and by Faure-Sj\"ostrand in the theory of Anosov flows.
