We systematically develop Weyl-Titchmarsh theory for singular differential operators on arbitrary intervals (a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} associated with rather general differential expressions of the type \[   \tau f = \frac{1}{r} (- \big(p[f' + s f]\big)' + s p[f' + s f] + qf),] where the coefficients p, q, r, s are real-valued and Lebesgue measurable on (a,b), with p\neq 0, r>0 a.e.\ on (a,b), and p^{-1}, q, r, s \in L^1_{\text{loc}}((a,b); dx), and f is supposed to satisfy [f \in AC_{\text{loc}}((a,b)), \; p[f' + s f] \in AC_{\text{loc}}((a,b)).] In particular, this setup implies that \tau permits a distributional potential coefficient, including potentials in H^{-1}_{\text{loc}}((a,b)).   We study maximal and minimal Sturm-Liouville operators, all self-adjoint restrictions of the maximal operator T_{\text{max}}, or equivalently, all self-adjoint extensions of the minimal operator T_{\text{min}}, all self-adjoint boundary conditions (separated and coupled ones), and describe the resolvent of any self-adjoint extension of T_{\text{min}}. In addition, we characterize the principal object of this paper, the singular Weyl-Titchmarsh-Kodaira m-function corresponding to any self-adjoint extension with separated boundary conditions and derive the corresponding spectral transformation, including a characterization of spectral multiplicities and minimal supports of standard subsets of the spectrum. We also deal with principal solutions and characterize the Friedrichs extension of T_{\text{min}}.   Finally, in the special case where \tau is regular, we characterize the Krein-von Neumann extension of T_{\text{min}} and also characterize all boundary conditions that lead to positivity preserving, equivalently, improving, resolvents (and hence semigroups).
