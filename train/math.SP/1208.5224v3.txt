In this note it is proved that the complete spectral data of selfadjoint Schr\"odinger operators on unbounded domains can be described with an associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. In particular, a characterization of the isolated and embedded eigenvalues, the corresponding eigenspaces, as well as the continuous and absolutely continuous spectrum in terms of the limiting behaviour of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map is obtained. Furthermore, a sufficient criterion for the absence of singular continuous spectrum is provided. The results are natural multidimensional analogues of classical facts from singular Sturm-Liouville theory.
