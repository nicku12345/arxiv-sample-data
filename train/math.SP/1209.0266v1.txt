The central problem we consider is the distribution of eigenvalues of closed linear operators which are not selfadjoint, with a focus on those operators which are obtained as perturbations of selfadjoint linear operators. Two methods are explained and elaborated. One approach uses complex analysis to study a holomorphic function whose zeros can be identified with the eigenvalues of the linear operator. The second method is an operator theoretic approach involving the numerical range. General results obtained by the two methods are derived and compared. Applications to non-selfadjoint Jacobi and Schr\"odinger operators are considered. Some possible directions for future research are discussed.
