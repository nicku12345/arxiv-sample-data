We consider a polyharmonic operator H=(-\Delta)^l+V(\x) in dimension two with l\geq 2, l being an integer, and a quasi-periodic potential V(\x). We prove that the absolutely continuous spectrum of H contains a semiaxis and there is a family of generalized eigenfunctions at every point of this semiaxis with the following properties. First, the eigenfunctions are close to plane waves e^{i< \k,\x>} at the high energy region. Second, the isoenergetic curves in the space of momenta \k corresponding to these eigenfunctions have a form of slightly distorted circles with holes (Cantor type structure). A new method of multiscale analysis in the momentum space is developed to prove these results.
