In this paper we use the formalism of S.Weinberg in order to construct a mathematical model based on the weak decay of hadrons and nuclei. In particular we consider a model which generalizes the weak decay of the nucleus of the cobalt. We associate with this model a Hamiltonian with cutoffs in a Fock space. The Hamiltonian is self-adjoint and has an unique ground state. By using the commutator theory we get a limiting absorption principle from which we deduce that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is absolutely continuous above the energy of the ground state and below the first threshold.
