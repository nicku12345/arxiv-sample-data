We develop the scattering theory for a pair of self-adjoint operators A_{0}=A_{1}\oplus...\oplus A_{N} and A=A_{1}+...+A_{N} under the assumption that all pair products A_{j}A_{k} with j\neq k satisfy certain regularity conditions. Roughly speaking, these conditions mean that the products A_{j}A_{k}, j\neq k, can be represented as integral operators with smooth kernels in the spectral representation of the operator A_{0}. We show that the absolutely continuous parts of the operators A_{0} and A are unitarily equivalent. This yields a smooth version of Ismagilov's theorem known earlier in the trace class framework. We also prove that the singular continuous spectrum of the operator A is empty and that its eigenvalues may accumulate only to "thresholds" of the absolutely continuous spectra of the operators A_{j}. Our approach relies on a system of resolvent equations which can be considered as a generalization of Faddeev's equations for three particle quantum systems.
