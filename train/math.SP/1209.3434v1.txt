We study perturbations (\tilde\tau_t)_{t\ge 0} of the semigroup of shifts (\tau_t)_{t\ge 0} on L^2(\R_+) with the property that \tilde\tau_t - \tau_t belongs to a certain Schatten-von Neumann class \gS_p with p\ge 1. We show that, for the unitary component in the Wold-Kolmogorov decomposition of the cogenerator of the semigroup (\tilde\tau_t)_{t\ge 0}, {\it any singular} spectral type may be achieved by \gS_1 perturbations. We provide an explicit construction for a perturbation with a given spectral type based on the theory of model spaces of the Hardy space H^2. Also we show that we may obtain {\it any} prescribed spectral type for the unitary component of the perturbed semigroup by a perturbation from the class \gS_p with p>1.
