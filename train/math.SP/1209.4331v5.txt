We study the quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger equation  -\psi"(x) + V(x) \psi(x) = E \psi(x), \qquad x \in \IR  in the regime of "small" V. Let (E_m',E"_m), m \in \zv, be the standard labeled gaps in the spectrum. Our main result says that if E"_m - E'_m \le \ve \exp(-\kappa_0 |m|) for all m \in \zv, with \ve being small enough, depending on \kappa_0 > 0 and the frequency vector involved, then the Fourier coefficients of V obey |c(m)| \le \ve^{1/2} \exp(-\frac{\kappa_0}{2} |m|) for all m \in \zv. On the other hand we prove that if |c(m)| \le \ve \exp(-\kappa_0 |m|) with \ve being small enough, depending on \kappa_0 > 0 and the frequency vector involved, then E"_m - E'_m \le 2 \ve \exp(-\frac{\kappa_0}{2} |m|).
