We prove two explicit bounds for the multiplicities of Steklov eigenvalues \sigma_k on compact surfaces with boundary. One of the bounds depends only on the genus of a surface and the index k of an eigenvalue, while the other depends as well on the number of boundary components. We also show that on any given smooth Riemannian surface with boundary, the multiplicities of Steklov eigenvalues \sigma_k are uniformly bounded in k.
