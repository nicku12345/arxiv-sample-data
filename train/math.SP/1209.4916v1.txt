We study the p-spectrum of a locally symmetric space of constant curvature \Gamma\backslash X, in connection with the right regular representation of the full isometry group G of X on L^2(\Gamma\backslash G)_{\tau_p}, where \tau_p is the complexified p-exterior representation of \mathrm{O}(n) on \bigwedge^p(\mathbb{R}^n)_\mathbb{C}. We give an expression of the multiplicity d_\lambda(p,\Gamma) of the eigenvalues of the p-Hodge-Laplace operator in terms of multiplicities n_\Gamma(\pi) of specific irreducible unitary representations of G.   As a consequence, we extend results of Pesce for the spectrum on functions to the p-spectrum of the Hodge-Laplace operator on p-forms of \Gamma\backslash X, and we compare p-isospectrality with \tau_p-equivalence for 0\leq p\leq n. For spherical space forms, we show that \tau-isospectrality implies \tau-equivalence for a class of \tau's that includes the case \tau=\tau_p. Furthermore we prove that p-1 and p+1-isospectral implies p-isospectral.   For nonpositive curvature space forms, we give examples showing that p-isospectrality is far from implying \tau_p-equivalence, but a variant of Pesce's result remains true. Namely, for each fixed p, q-isospectrality for every 0\leq q\leq p implies \tau_q-equivalence for every 0\leq q\leq p. As a byproduct of the methods we obtain several results relating p-isospectrality with \tau_p-equivalence.
