The current paper is devoted to the study of existence, uniqueness and Lifshitz tails of the integrated density of surface states (IDSS) for Schr\"{o}dinger operators with alloy type random surface potentials. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the IDSS for negative energies, which is defined as the thermodynamic limit of the normalized eigenvalue counting functions of localized operators on strips with sections being special cuboids. Under the additional assumption that the single-site impurity potential decays anisotropically, we also prove that the IDSS for negative energies exhibits Lifshitz tails near the bottom of the almost sure spectrum in the following three regimes: the quantum regime, the quantum-classical/classical-quantum regime and the classical regime. We point out that the quantum-classical/classical-quantum regime is new for random surface models.
