Operators conserving the indefinite scalar product on a Krein space (K,J) are called J-unitary. Such an operator T is defined to be S^1-Fredholm if T-z is Fredholm for all z on the unit circle S^1, and essentially S^1-gapped if there is only discrete spectrum on S^1. For paths in the S^1-Fredholm operators an intersection index similar to the Conley-Zehnder index is introduced. The strict subclass of essentially S^1-gapped operators has a countable number of components which can be distinguished by a homotopy invariant given by the signature of J restricted to the eigenspace of all eigenvalues on S^1. These concepts are illustrated by several examples.
