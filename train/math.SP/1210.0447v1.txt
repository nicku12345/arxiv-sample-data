In this paper, we reduce the general linear integral equation of the third kind in L^2(Y,\mu), with largely arbitrary kernel and coefficient, to an equivalent integral equation either of the second kind or of the first kind in L^2(\mathbb{R}), with the kernel being the linear pencil of bounded infinitely differentiable bi-Carleman kernels expandable in absolutely and uniformly convergent bilinear series. The reduction is done by using unitary equivalence transformations.
