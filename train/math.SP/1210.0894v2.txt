Let \Gamma_1 and \Gamma_2 be Bieberbach groups contained in the full isometry group G of \mathbb{R}^n. We prove that if the compact flat manifolds \Gamma_1\backslash\mathbb{R}^n and \Gamma_2\backslash\mathbb{R}^n are strongly isospectral then the Bieberbach groups \Gamma_1 and \Gamma_2 are representation equivalent, that is, the right regular representations L^2(\Gamma_1\backslash G) and L^2(\Gamma_2\backslash G) are unitarily equivalent.
