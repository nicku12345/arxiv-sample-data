In this paper, we study an infinite system of Fredholm series of polynomials in \lambda, formed, in the classical way, for a continuous Hilbert-Schmidt kernel on \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R} of the form \boldsymbol{H}(s,t)-\lambda\boldsymbol{S}(s,t), where \lambda is a complex parameter. We prove a convergence of these series in the complex plane with respect to sup-norms of various spaces of continuous functions vanishing at infinity. The convergence results enable us to solve explicitly an integral equation of the second kind in L^2(\mathbb{R}), whose kernel is of the above form, by mimicking the classical Fredholm-determinant method.
