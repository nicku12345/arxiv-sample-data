In this note we prove Minami's estimate for a class of discrete alloy-type models with a sign-changing single-site potential of finite support. We apply Minami's estimate to prove Poisson statistics for the energy level spacing. Our result is valid for random potentials which are in a certain sense sufficiently close to the standard Anderson potential (rank one perturbations coupled with i.i.d. random variables).
