For any integral operator K in the Schatten--von Neumann classes of compact operators and its approximated operator K_N\sim(N\ge1) obtained by using for example a quadrature or projection method, we show that the convergence of the approximate p-modified Fredholm determinants \sideset{}{_{Np}}\det(I_N+zK_N) to the p-modified Fredholm determinants \sideset{}{_p}\det(I_\mathcal{H}+zK) is uniform for all p\ge1. As a result, we give the rate of convergences when evaluating at an eigenvalue or at an element of the resolvent set of K.
