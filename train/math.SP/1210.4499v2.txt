Let (M,g_0) be a compact Riemmanian manifold of dimension n. Let P_0 (\h) := -\h^2\Delta_{g}+V be the semiclassical Schr\"{o}dinger operator for \h \in (0,\h_0], and let E be a regular value of its principal symbol p_0(x,\xi)=|\xi|^2_{g_0(x)} +V(x). Write \varphi_\h for an L^2-normalized eigenfunction of P(\h), P_0(\h)\varphi_\h =E(\h)\varphi_\h and E(\h) \in [E-o(1),E+ o(1)]. Consider a smooth family of perturbations g_u of g_0 with u in the ball \mathcal B^k(\varepsilon) \subset \mathbb R^k of radius \varepsilon>0. For P_{u}(\h) := -\h^2 \Delta_{g_u} +V and small |t|, we define the propagated perturbed eigenfunctions \varphi_\h^{(u)}:=e^{-\frac{i}{\h}t P_u(\h)} \varphi_\h.   We study the distribution of the real part of the perturbed eigenfunctions regarded as random variables \Re (\varphi^{(\cdot)}_\h(x)):\mathcal B^{k}(\varepsilon) \to \mathbb R \quad \quad \text{for}\;\, x\in M. In particular, when (M,g) is ergodic, we compute the h \to 0^+ asymptotics of the variance \text{Var} [\Re (\varphi^{(\cdot)}_\h(x))]  and show that all odd moments vanish as h \to 0^+.
