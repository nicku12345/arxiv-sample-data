We show the existence and orthogonality of wave operators naturally associated to a compatible Laplacian on a complete manifold with a corner of codimension 2. In fact, we prove asymptotic completeness i.e. that the image of these wave operators is equal to the space of absolutely continuous states of the compatible Laplacian. We achieve this last result using time dependent methods coming from many-body Schr\"odinger equations.
