We study spectral properties of the Carleman operator (the Hankel operator with kernel h_{0}(t)=t^{-1}) and, in particular, find an explicit formula for its resolvent. Then we consider perturbations of the Carleman operator H_{0} by Hankel operators V with kernels v(t) decaying sufficiently rapidly as t\to\infty and not too singular at t=0. Our goal is to develop scattering theory for the pair H_{0}, H=H_{0} +V  and to construct an expansion in eigenfunctions of the continuous spectrum of the Hankel operator H. We also prove that under general assumptions the singular continuous spectrum of the operator H is empty and that its eigenvalues may accumulate only to the edge points 0 and \pi in the spectrum of H_{0}. We find simple conditions for the finiteness of the total number of eigenvalues of the operator H lying above the (continuous) spectrum of the Carleman operator H_{0} and obtain an explicit estimate of this number. The theory constructed is somewhat analogous to the theory of one-dimensional differential operators.
