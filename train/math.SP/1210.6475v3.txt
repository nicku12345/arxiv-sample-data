We consider a simple modification of the 1D-Laplacian where non-mixed interface conditions occur at the boundaries of a finite interval. It has recently been shown that Schr\"odinger operators having this form allow a new approach to the transverse quantum transport through resonant heterostructures. In this perspective, it is important to control the deformations effects introduced on the spectrum and on the time propagator by this class of non-selfadjont perturbations. In order to obtain uniform-in-time estimates of the perturbed semigroup, our strategy consists in constructing stationary waves operators allowing to intertwine the modified non-selfadjoint Schr\"odinger operator with a 'physical' Hamiltonian. For small values of a deformation parameter '{\theta}', this yields a dynamical comparison between the two models showing that the distance between the corresponding semigroups is dominated by |{\theta}| uniformly in time in the L^2-operator norm.
