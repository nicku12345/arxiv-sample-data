We discuss inverse spectral theory for singular differential operators on arbitrary intervals (a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} associated with rather general differential expressions of the type \[\tau f = \frac{1}{r} \left(- \big(p[f' + s f]\big)' + s p[f' + s f] + qf\right), \] where the coefficients p, q, r, s are Lebesgue measurable on (a,b) with p^{-1}, q, r, s \in L^1_{\text{loc}}((a,b); dx) and real-valued with p\not=0 and r>0 a.e.\ on (a,b). In particular, we explicitly permit certain distributional potential coefficients.   The inverse spectral theory results derived in this paper include those implied by the spectral measure, by two-spectra and three-spectra, as well as local Borg-Marchenko-type inverse spectral results. The special cases of Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials and Sturm--Liouville operators in impedance form are isolated, in particular.
