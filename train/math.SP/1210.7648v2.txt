We consider two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators H with Aharonov-Bohm magnetic field and an additional electric potential. We obtain an explicit leading term of the asymptotic expansion of the unitary group e^{-i t H} for t\to\infty in weighted L^2 spaces. In particular, we show that the magnetic field improves the decay of e^{-i t H} with respect to the unitary group generated by non-magnetic Schr\"odinger operators, and that the decay rate in time is determined by the magnetic flux.
