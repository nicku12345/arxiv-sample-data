We establish sharp pointwise estimates for the ground states of some singular fractional Schr\"odinger operators on relatively compact Euclidean subsets. The considered operators are of the type (-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}|_\Om-c|x|^{-\alpha}, where (-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}|_\Om is the fraction-Laplacien on an open subset \Om in \R with zero exterior condition and 0<c\leq(\frac{d-\alpha}{2})^2. The intrinsic ultracontractivity property for such operators is discussed as well and a sharp large time asymptotic for their heat kernels is derived.
