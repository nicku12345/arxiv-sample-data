Let A and B be bounded operators on a Banach lattice E such that the commutator C=AB-BA and the product BA are positive operators. If the product AB is a power-compact operator, then C is a quasi-nilpotent operator having a triangularizing chain of closed ideals of E. This theorem answers an open question posed in a paper by Bra\v{c}i\v{c}, Drnov\v{s}ek, Farforovskaya, Rabkin and Zem\'{a}nek.
