A nonlinear scattering transform is studied for the two-dimensional Schrodinger equation at zero energy with a radial potential. First explicit examples are presented, both theoretically and computationally, of potentials with nontrivial singularities in the scattering transform. The singularities arise from non-uniqueness of the complex geometric optics solutions that define the scattering transform. The values of the complex spectral parameter at which the singularities appear are called exceptional points. The singularity formation is closely related to the fact that potentials of conductivity type are critical in the sense of Murata.
