We develop a microspectral theory for quasinilpotent linear operators Q (i.e., those with \sigma(Q) = \{0}) in a Banach space. When such Q is not compact, normal, or nilpotent, the classical spectral theory gives little information, and a somewhat deeper structure can be recovered from microspectral sets in \C. Such sets describe, e.g., semigroup generation, resolvent properties, power boundedness as well as Tauberian properties associated to zQ for z \in \C.
