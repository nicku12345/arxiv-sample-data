This survey article deals with a delta potential - also known as a point scatterer - on flat 2D and 3D tori. We introduce the main conjectures regarding the spectral and wave function statistics of this model in the so- called weak and strong coupling regimes. We report on recent progress as well as a number of open problems in this field.
