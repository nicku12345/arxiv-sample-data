Let d\mu(t) be a probability measure on [0,+\infty) such that its moments are finite. Then the Cauchy-Stieltjes transform S of d\mu(t) is a Stieltjes function, which admits an expansion into a Stieltjes continued fraction. In the present paper, we consider a matrix interpretation of the unwrapping transformation from S(\lambda) to \lambda S(\lambda^2), which is intimately related to the simplest case of polynomial mappings. More precisely, it is shown that this transformation is essentially a Darboux transformation of the underlying Jacobi matrix. Moreover, in this scheme, the Chihara construction of solutions to the Carlitz problem appears as a shifted Darboux transformation.
