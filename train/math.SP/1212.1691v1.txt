We study spectral properties of Hamiltonians \rH_{X,\gB,q} with \delta'-point interactions on a discrete set X={x_k}_{k=1}^\infty\subset\R_+. %at the centers x_n on the positive half line in terms of energy forms. Using the form approach, we establish analogs of some classical results on operators \rH_q=-d^2/dx^2+q with locally integrable potentials q\in L^1_{\loc}(\R_+). In particular, we establish analogues of the Glazman-Povzner-Wienholtz theorem, the Molchanov discreteness criterion, and the Birman theorem on stability of an essential spectrum. It turns out that in contrast to the case of Hamiltonians with \delta-interactions, spectral properties of operators \rH_{X,\gB,q} are closely connected with those of \rH_{X,q}^N=\oplus_{k}\rH_{q,k}^N, where \rH_{q,k}^N is the Neumann realization of -d^2/dx^2+q in L^2(x_{k-1},x_k).
