Let H_{0, D} (resp., H_{0,N}) be the Schroedinger operator in constant magnetic field on the half-plane with Dirichlet (resp., Neumann) boundary conditions, and let H_\ell : = H_{0, \ell} - V, \ell =D,N, where the scalar potential V is non negative, bounded, does not vanish identically, and decays at infinity. We compare the distribution of the eigenvalues of H_D and H_N below the respective infima of the essential spectra. To this end, we construct effective Hamiltonians which govern the asymptotic behaviour of the discrete spectrum of H_\ell near \inf \sigma_{ess}(H_\ell) = \inf \sigma(H_{0,\ell}), \ell = D,N. Applying these Hamiltonians, we show that \sigma_{disc}(H_D) is infinite even if V has a compact support, while \sigma_{disc}(H_N) could be finite or infinite depending on the decay rate of V.
