Let (M,g) be a compact, boundaryless manifold of dimension n with the property that either (i) n=2 and (M,g) has no conjugate points, or (ii) the sectional curvatures of (M,g) are nonpositive. Let \Delta be the positive Laplacian on M determined by g. We study the L^{2}\to{}L^{p} mapping properties of a spectral cluster of \sqrt{\Delta} of width 1/\log\lambda. Under the geometric assumptions above, \cite{berard77} B\'{e}rard obtained a logarithmic improvement for the remainder term of the eigenvalue counting function which directly leads to a (\log\lambda)^{1/2} improvement for H\"ormander's estimate on the L^{\infty} norms of eigenfunctions. In this paper we extend this improvement to the L^p estimates for all p>\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1}.
