We consider the KdV equation  \partial_t u +\partial^3_x u +u\partial_x u=0  with quasi-periodic initial data whose Fourier coefficients decay exponentially and prove existence and uniqueness, in the class of functions which have an expansion with exponentially decaying Fourier coefficients, of a solution on a small interval of time, the length of which depends on the given data and the frequency vector involved. For a Diophantine frequency vector and for small quasi-periodic data (i.e., when the Fourier coefficients obey |c(m)| \le \varepsilon \exp(-\kappa_0 |m|) with \varepsilon > 0 sufficiently small, depending on \kappa_0 > 0 and the frequency vector), we prove global existence and uniqueness of the solution. The latter result relies on our recent work \cite{DG} on the inverse spectral problem for the quasi-periodic Schr\"{o}dinger equation.
