We prove an analogue of the magnetic nodal theorem on quantum graphs: the number of zeros \phi of the n-th eigenfunction of the Schr\"odinger operator on a quantum graph is related to the stability of the n-th eigenvalue of the perturbation of the operator by magnetic potential. More precisely, we consider the n-th eigenvalue as a function of the magnetic perturbation and show that its Morse index at zero magnetic field is equal to \phi - (n-1).
