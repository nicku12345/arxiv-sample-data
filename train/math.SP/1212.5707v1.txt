We prove stability and exponential convergence of the Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) method for acoustic scattering on manifolds with axial analytic quasicylindrical ends. These manifolds model long-range geometric perturbations (e.g. bending or stretching) of tubular waveguides filled with homogeneous or inhomogeneous media.   We construct non-reflective infinite PMLs replacing the metric on a part of the manifold by a non-degenerate complex symmetric tensor field. We prove that the problem with PMLs of finite length is uniquely solvable and solutions to this problem locally approximate scattered solutions with an error that exponentially tends to zero as the length of PMLs tends to infinity.
