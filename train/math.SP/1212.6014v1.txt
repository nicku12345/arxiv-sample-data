We survey recent results concerning the hereditary completeness of some special systems of functions and the spectral synthesis problem for a related class of linear operators. We present a solution of the spectral synthesis problem for systems of exponentials in L^2(-\pi, \pi). Analogous results are obtained for the systems of reproducing kernels in the de Branges spaces of entire functions. We also apply these results (via a functional model) to the spectral theory of rank one perturbations of compact self-adjoint operators.
