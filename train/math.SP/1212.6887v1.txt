We use the boundary triplet approach to extend the classical concept of perturbation determinants to a more general setup. In particular, we examine the concept of perturbation determinants to pairs of proper extensions of closed symmetric operators. For an ordered pair of extensions we express the perturbation determinant in terms of the abstract Weyl function and the corresponding boundary operators. A crucial role in our approach plays so-called almost solvable extensions. We obtain trace formulas for pairs of self-adjoint, dissipative and other pairs of extensions and express the spectral shift function in terms of the abstract Weyl function and the characteristic function of almost solvable extensions.   We emphasize that for pairs of dissipative extensions our results are new even for the case of additive perturbations. In this case we improve and complete some classical results of M.G. Krein for pairs of self-adjoint and dissipative operators. We apply the main results to ordinary differential operators and to elliptic operators as well.
