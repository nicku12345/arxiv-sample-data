Given a complex, separable Hilbert space \cH, we consider differential expressions of the type \tau = - (d^2/dx^2) + V(x), with x \in (a,\infty) or x \in \bbR. Here V denotes a bounded operator-valued potential V(\cdot) \in \cB(\cH) such that V(\cdot) is weakly measurable and the operator norm \|V(\cdot)\|_{\cB(\cH)} is locally integrable.   We consider self-adjoint half-line L^2-realizations H_{\alpha} in L^2((a,\infty); dx; \cH) associated with \tau, assuming a to be a regular endpoint necessitating a boundary condition of the type \sin(\alpha)u'(a) + \cos(\alpha)u(a)=0, indexed by the self-adjoint operator \alpha = \alpha^* \in \cB(\cH). In addition, we study self-adjoint full-line L^2-realizations H of \tau in L^2(\bbR; dx; \cH). In either case we treat in detail basic spectral theory associated with H_{\alpha} and H, including Weyl--Titchmarsh theory, Green's function structure, eigenfunction expansions, diagonalization, and a version of the spectral theorem.
