The article deals with a convergence of the spectrum of the Neumann Laplacian in a periodic unbounded domain \Omega^\varepsilon depending on a small parameter \varepsilon>0. The domain has the form \Omega^\varepsilon=\mathbb{R}^n\setminus S^\varepsilon, where S^\varepsilon is an \varepsilon\mathbb{Z}^n-periodic family of trap-like screens. We prove that for an arbitrarily large L the spectrum has just one gap in [0,L] when \varepsilon small enough, moreover when \varepsilon\to 0 this gap converges to some interval whose edges can be controlled by a suitable choice of geometry of the screens. An application to the theory of 2D-photonic crystals is discussed.
