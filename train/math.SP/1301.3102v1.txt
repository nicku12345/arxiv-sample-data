We consider a non-self-adjoint pseudodifferential operator in the semi-classical limit (h\to 0). The principal symbol is given by p. We know that the resolvent (z-P)^{-1} exists inside the range up to a distance O((h\ln\frac{1}{h})^{\frac{k}{k+1}}) from certain boundary points, where k\in\{2,4,...\}. In this work, we improve the resolvent estimates given by different authors in the case k=2 and in dimension one. For the proof, we will construct quasimodes by a scaling for z very close to the boundary. We give some applications of this formula.
