A generalization of the definition of an oscillatory matrix based on the theory of cones is given in this paper. The positivity and simplicity of all the eigenvalues of a generalized oscillatory matrix are proved. The classes of generalized even and odd oscillatory matrices are introduced. Spectral properties of the obtained matrices are studied. Criteria of generalized even and odd oscillation are given. Examples of generalized even and odd oscillatory matrices are presented.
