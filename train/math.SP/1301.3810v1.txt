As an application of the Gordon lemma for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle, we prove that for a generic set of quasiperiodic Verblunsky coefficients the corresponding two-sided CMV operator has purely singular continuous spectrum. We use a similar argument to that of the Boshernitzan-Damanik result that establishes the corresponding theorem for the discrete Schr\"odinger operator.
