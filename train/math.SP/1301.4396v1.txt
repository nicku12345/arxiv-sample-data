In this paper we investigate spectral properties of Lapla- cians on Rooms and Passages domains. In the first part, we use Dirichlet- Neumann bracketing techniques to show that for the Neumann Lapla- cian in certain Rooms and Passages domains the second term of the asymptotic expansion of the counting function is of order \sqrt{\lambda}. For the Dirichlet Laplacian our methods only give an upper estimate of the form \sqrt{\lambda}. In the second part of the paper, we consider the relation- ship between Neumann Laplacians on Rooms and Passages domains and Sturm-Liouville operators on the skeleton.
