We establish a mutual relationship between main analytic objects for the dissipative extension theory of a symmetric operator \dot A with deficiency indices (1,1). In particular, we introduce the Weyl-Titchmarsh function \cM of a maximal dissipative extension \hat A of the symmetric operator \dot A. Given a reference self-adjoint extension A of \dot A, we introduce a von Neumann parameter \kappa, |\kappa|<1, characterizing the domain of the dissipative extension \hat A against \Dom (A) and show that the pair (\kappa, \cM) is a complete unitary invariant of the triple (\dot A, A, \hat A), unless \kappa=0. As a by-product of our considerations we obtain a relevant functional model for a dissipative operator and get an analog of the formula of Krein for its resolvent.
