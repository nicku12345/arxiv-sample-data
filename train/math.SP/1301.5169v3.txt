Let H := H_{0} + V and H_{\perp} := H_{0,\perp} + V be respectively perturbations of the free Schr\"odinger operators H_{0} on L^{2}\big(\mathbb{R}^{2d+1}\big) and H_{0,\perp} on L^{2}\big(\mathbb{R}^{2d}\big), d \geq 1 with constant magnetic field of strength b>0, and V is a complex relatively compact perturbation. We prove Lieb-Thirring type inequalities for the discrete spectrum of H and H_{\perp}. In particular, these estimates give a\, priori information on the distribution of the discrete eigenvalues around the Landau levels of the operator, and describe how fast sequences of eigenvalues converge.
