The purpose of this Note is to highlight the spectral instability of some non-selfadjoint differential operators, by studying the growth rate of the norms of the spectral projections \Pi_n associated with their eigenvalues. More precisely, we are concerned with the complex Airy operator and even anharmonic oscillator. We get asymptotic expansions for the norm of the spectral projections associated with the large eigenvalues, extending the results of Davies and Davies-Kuijlaars.
