If X is a contact Anosov vector field on a smooth compact manifold M and V is a smooth function on M, it is known that the differential operator A=-X+V has some discrete spectrum called Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in specific Sobolev spaces. We show that for |Im(z)| large the eigenvalues of A are restricted to vertical bands and in the gaps between the bands, the resolvent of A is bounded uniformly with respect to |Im(z)|. In each isolated band the density of eigenvalues is given by the Weyl law. In the first band, most of the eigenvalues concentrate of the vertical line Re(z)=< D >, the space average of the function D(x)=V(x)-1/2 div(X)/E_u where Eu is the unstable distribution. This band spectrum gives an asymptotic expansion for dynamical correlation functions.
