We prove a quantitative statement of the quantum ergodicity for Hecke--Maass cusp forms on the modular surface. As an application of our result, along a density 1 subsequence of even Hecke--Maass cusp forms, we obtain a sharp lower bound for the L^2-norm of the restriction to a fixed compact geodesic segment of \eta=\{iy~:~y>0\} \subset \mathbb{H}. We also obtain an upper bound of O_\epsilon\left(t_\phi^{3/8+\epsilon}\right) for the L^\infty norm along a density 1 subsequence of Hecke--Maass cusp forms; for such forms, this is an improvement over the upper bound of O_\epsilon\left(t_\phi^{5/12+\epsilon}\right) given by Iwaniec and Sarnak.   In a recent work of Ghosh, Reznikov, and Sarnak, the authors proved for all even Hecke--Maass forms that the number of nodal domains, which intersect a geodesic segment of \eta, grows faster than t_\phi^{1/12-\epsilon} for any \epsilon>0, under the assumption that the Lindel{\"o}f Hypothesis is true and that the geodesic segment is long enough. Upon removing a density zero subset of even Hecke--Maass forms, we prove without making any assumptions that the number of nodal domains grows faster than t_\phi^{1/8-\epsilon} for any \epsilon>0.
