Consider the undirected graph G_n=(V_n, E_n) where V_n = (Z/nZ)^2 and E_n contains an edge from (x,y) to (x+1,y), (x,y+1), (x+y,y), and (x,y+x) for every (x,y) \in V_n. Gabber and Galil, following Margulis, gave an elementary proof that {G_n} forms an expander family. In this note, we present a somewhat simpler proof of this fact, and demonstrate its utility by isolating a key property of the linear transformations (x,y) -> (x+y,x), (x,y+x) that yields expansion.   As an example, consider any invertible, integral matrix S \in GL_2(Z) and let G^S_n = (V_n, E^S_n) where E^S_n contains, for every (x,y) \in V_n, an edge from (x,y) to (x+1,y), (x,y+1), S(x,y), and S^T(x,y), where S^T denotes the transpose of S. Then {G_n^S} forms an expander family if and only if a related infinite graph has positive Cheeger constant. This latter property turns out to be elementary to analyze and can be used to show that {G_n^S} are expanders precisely when the trace of S is non-zero and S is not equal to its transpose. We also present some other generalizations.
