We establish inequalities for the eigenvalues of the sub-Laplace operator associated with a pseudo-Hermitian structure on a strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold. Our inequalities extend those obtained by Niu and Zhang \cite{NiuZhang} for the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the sub-Laplacian on a bounded domain in the Heisenberg group and are in the spirit of the well known Payne-P\'{o}lya-Weinberger and Yang universal inequalities.
