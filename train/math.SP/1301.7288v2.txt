We discuss the exotic properties of the heat-trace asymptotics for a regular-singular operator with general boundary conditions at the singular end, as observed by Falomir, Muschietti, Pisani and Seeley as well as by Kirsten, Loya and Park. We explain how their results alternatively follow from the general heat kernel construction by Mooers, a natural question that has not been addressed yet, as the latter work did not elaborate explicitly on the singular structure of the heat trace expansion beyond the statement of non-polyhomogeneity of the heat kernel.
