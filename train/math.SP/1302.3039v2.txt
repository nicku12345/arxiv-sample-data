Let P be a linear, second order, elliptic operator satisfying a Hardy inequality with potential W (i.e. P-W\geq0) and best constant \alpha. We give conditions so that the spectrum of W^{-1}P is [\alpha,\infty). We apply this to several well-known Hardy inequalities: (improved) Hardy inequalities on a bounded convex domain with potential involving the distance to the boundary, and Hardy inequalities for minimal submanifolds of the Euclidean space.
