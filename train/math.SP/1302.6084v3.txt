In this paper, it is proved that (strict) copositivity of a symmetric tensor \mathcal{A} is equivalent to the fact that every principal sub-tensor of \mathcal{A} has no a (non-positive) negative H^{++}-eigenvalue. The necessary and sufficient conditions are also given in terms of the Z^{++}-eigenvalue of the principal sub-tensor of the given tensor. This presents a method of testing (strict) copositivity of a symmetric tensor by means of the lower dimensional tensors. Also the equivalent definition of strictly copositive tensors is given on entire space \mathbb{R}^n.
