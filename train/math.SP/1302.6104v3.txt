The aim of the article is to show a H{\"o}rmander spectral multiplier theorem for an operator A whose kernel of the semigroup \exp(-zA) satisfies certain Poisson estimates for complex times z. Here \exp(-zA) acts on L^p(\Omega),\,1 < p < \infty, where \Omega is a space of homogeneous type with the additional condition that the measure of annuli is controlled. In most of the known H{\"o}rmander type theorems in the literature, Gaussian bounds and self-adjointness for the semigroup are needed, whereas here the new feature is that the assumptions are the to some extend weaker Poisson bounds, and \HI calculus in place of self-adjointness. The order of derivation in our H{\"o}rmander multiplier result is typically \frac{d}{2}, d being the dimension of the space \Omega. Moreover the functional calculus resulting from our H{\"o}rmander theorem is shown to be R-bounded. Finally, the result is applied to some examples.
