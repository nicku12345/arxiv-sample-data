By a transfer operator approach to Maass cusp forms and the Selberg zeta function for cofinite Hecke triangle groups, M. M\"oller and the author found a factorization of the Selberg zeta function into a product of Fredholm determinants of transfer-operator-like families: Z(s) = \det(1-\mc L_s^+)\det(1-\mc L_s^-). In this article we show that the operator families \mc L_s^\pm arise as families of transfer operators for the triangle groups underlying the Hecke triangle groups, and that for s\in\C, \Rea s=\tfrac12, the operator \mc L_s^+ (resp. \mc L_s^-) has a 1-eigenfunction if and only if there exists an even (resp. odd) Maass cusp form with eigenvalue s(1-s). For nonarithmetic Hecke triangle groups, this result provides a new formulation of the Phillips-Sarnak conjecture on nonexistence of even Maass cusp forms.
