We first show that the eigenvector of a tensor is well-defined. The differences between the eigenvectors of a tensor and its E-eigenvectors are the eigenvectors on the nonsingular projective variety \mathbb S=\{\mathbf x\in\mathbb P^n\;|\;\sum\limits_{i=0}^nx_i^2=0\}. We show that a generic tensor has no eigenvectors on \mathbb S. Actually, we show that a generic tensor has no eigenvectors on a proper nonsingular projective variety in \mathbb P^n. By these facts, we show that the coefficients of the E-characteristic polynomial are algebraically dependent. Actually, a certain power of the determinant of the tensor can be expressed through the coefficients besides the constant term. Hence, a nonsingular tensor always has an E-eigenvector. When a tensor \mathcal T is nonsingular and symmetric, its E-eigenvectors are exactly the singular points of a class of hypersurfaces defined by \mathcal T and a parameter. We give explicit factorization of the discriminant of this class of hypersurfaces, which completes Cartwright and Strumfels' formula. We show that the factorization contains the determinant and the E-characteristic polynomial of the tensor \mathcal T as irreducible factors.
