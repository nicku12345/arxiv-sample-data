In this paper, we show that the eigenvectors of the zero Laplacian and signless Lapacian eigenvalues of a k-uniform hypergraph are closely related to some configured components of that hypergraph. We show that the components of an eigenvector of the zero Laplacian or signless Lapacian eigenvalue have the same modulus. Moreover, under a {\em canonical} regularization, the phases of the components of these eigenvectors only can take some uniformly distributed values in \{\{exp}(\frac{2j\pi}{k})\;|\;j\in [k]\}. These eigenvectors are divided into H-eigenvectors and N-eigenvectors. Eigenvectors with minimal support is called {\em minimal}. The minimal canonical H-eigenvectors characterize the even (odd)-bipartite connected components of the hypergraph and vice versa, and the minimal canonical N-eigenvectors characterize some multi-partite connected components of the hypergraph and vice versa.
