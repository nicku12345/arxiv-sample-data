We study the problem of estimating the L^2 norm of Laplace eigenfunctions on a compact Riemannian manifold M when restricted to a hypersurface H. We prove mass estimates for the restrictions of eigenfunctions \phi_h, (h^2 \Delta - 1)\phi_h = 0, to H in the region exterior to the coball bundle of H, on h^{\delta}-scales (0\leq \delta < 2/3). We use this estimate to obtain an O(1) L^2-restriction bound for the Neumann data along H. The estimate also applies to eigenfunctions of semiclassical Schr\"odinger operators.
