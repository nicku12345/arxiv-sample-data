We consider asymptotics of the ground state energy of heavy atoms and molecules in the self-generatedl magnetic field. Namely, we consider  H=((D-A)\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma})^2-V  with V=\sum_{1\le m\le M} \frac{Z_m}{|x-y_m|} and a corresponding Multiparticle Quantum Hamiltonian  \mathsf{H}=\sum_{1\le n\le N} H_{x_n} +\sum_{1\le n < n'\le N}|x_n-x_{n'}|^{-1}  on the Fock space \wedge _{1\le n\le N} L^2(\mathbb{R}^3, \mathbb{C}^2). Here A is a self-generated magnetic fiels. Then the ground state energy is given by  \mathsf{E}(A)=\inf \operatorname{Spec}(\mathsf{H})+\frac{1}{\alpha}\int |\nabla \times A|^2\,dx  where the last term is the energy of magnetic field. Under assumption \alpha Z\le \kappa^* (with a small constant \kappa^*) we study the ground State Energy  \mathsf{E}^*=\inf _{A}\mathsf{E}(A).  We derive its asymptotics including Scott, and Schwinger and Dirac corrections.   We also consider related topics: an excessive negative charge, ionization energy and excessive positive charge when atoms can still bind into molecules.
