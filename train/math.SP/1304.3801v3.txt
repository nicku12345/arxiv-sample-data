Five essential spectra of linear relations are defined in terms of semi-Fredholm properties and the index. Basic properties of these sets are established and the perturbation theory for semi-Fredholm relations is then applied to verify a generalisation of Weyl's theorem for single-valued operators. We conclude with a spectral mapping theorem.
