We prove a strong conditional unique continuation estimate for irreducible quasimodes in rotationally invariant neighbourhoods on compact surfaces of revolution. The estimate states that Laplace quasimodes which cannot be decomposed as a sum of other quasimodes have L^2 mass bounded below by C_\epsilon \lambda^{-1 - \epsilon} for any \epsilon>0 on any open rotationally invariant neighbourhood which meets the semiclassical wavefront set of the quasimode. For an analytic manifold, we conclude the same estimate with a lower bound of C_\delta \lambda^{-1 + \delta} for some fixed \delta>0.
