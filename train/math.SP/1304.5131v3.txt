This paper is concerned with the lower bounds for the principal frequency of the p-Laplacian on n-dimensional Euclidean domains. In particular, we extend the classical results involving the inner radius of a domain and the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator to the case p\neq2. As a by-product, we obtain a lower bound on the size of the nodal set of an eigenfunction of the p-Laplacian on planar domains.
