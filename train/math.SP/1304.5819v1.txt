The unique reconstruction of a spherically-symmetric wave speed v is considered in a bounded spherical region of radius b from the set of corresponding transmission eigenvalues for which the corresponding eigenfunctions are also spherically symmetric. If the integral of 1/v on the interval [0,b] is less than b, assuming that there exists at least one v corresponding to the data, v is uniquely reconstructed from the data consisting of such transmission eigenvalues and their "multiplicities," where the multiplicity is defined as the multiplicity of the transmission eigenvalue as a zero of a key quantity. When that integral is equal to b, the unique reconstruction is presented when the data set contains one additional piece of information. Some similar results are presented for the unique reconstruction of the potential from the transmission eigenvalues with multiplicities for a related Schr\"odinger equation.
