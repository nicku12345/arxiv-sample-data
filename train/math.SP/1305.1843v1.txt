We study one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with complex measures as potentials and present an improved criterion for absence of eigenvalues which involves a weak local periodicity condition. The criterion leads to sharp quantitative bounds on the eigenvalues. We apply our result to quasiperiodic measures as potentials.
