Given a one-dimensional weighted Dirac operator we can define a spectral measure by virtue of singular Weyl-Titchmarsh-Kodaira theory. Using the theory of de Branges spaces we show that the spectral measure uniquely determines the Dirac operator up to a gauge transformation. Our result applies in particular to radial Dirac operators and extends the classical results for Dirac operators with one regular endpoint. Moreover, our result also improves the currently known results for canonical (Hamiltonian) systems. If one endpoint is limit circle case, we also establish corresponding two-spectra results.
