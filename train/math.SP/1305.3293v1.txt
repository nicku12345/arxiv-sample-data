Let \Omega\subset \RR^2 be a domain having a compact boundary \Sigma which is Lipschitz and piecewise C^4 smooth, and let \nu denote the inward unit normal vector on \Sigma. We study the principal eigenvalue E(\beta) of the Laplacian in \Omega with the Robin boundary conditions \partial f/\partial\nu +\beta f=0 on \Sigma, where \beta is a positive number. Assuming that \Sigma has no convex corners we show the estimate E(\beta)=-\beta^2- \gamma_\mx\beta + O\big(\beta^\{2}{3}\big) as \beta\to+\infty, where \gamma_\mx is the maximal curvature of the boundary.
