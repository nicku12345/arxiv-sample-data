We reconsider the norm resolvent limit of -\Delta + V_\ell with V_\ell tending to a point interaction in three dimensions. We are mainly interested in potentials V_\ell modelling short range interactions of cold atomic gases. In order to ensure stability the interaction V_\ell is required to have a strong repulsive core, such that \lim_{\ell \to 0} \int V_\ell >0. This situation is not covered in the previous literature.
