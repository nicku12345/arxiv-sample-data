We consider quasimodes on planar domains with a partially rectangular boundary. We prove that for any \epsilon_0>0, an \O(\lambda^{-\epsilon_0}) quasimode must have L^2 mass in the "wings" bounded below by \lambda^{-2-\delta} for any \delta>0. The proof uses the author's recent work on 0-Gevrey smooth domains to approximate quasimodes on C^{1,1} domains. There is an improvement for C^{2,\alpha} domains.
