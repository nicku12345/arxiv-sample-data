This paper is essentially devoted to the study of the minimal eigenvalue \lambda_{N,\alpha} of the Toepllitz matrice T_N(\varphi_{\alpha}) where \varphi_{\alpha}(e^{i \theta})=|1- e^{i \theta} |^{2\alpha} c_{1}(e^{i \theta}) with c_{1} a positive sufficiently smooth function and 0<\alpha<\frac{1}{2}. We obtain \lambda_{N,\alpha}\sim c_{\alpha}N^{-2\alpha}c_{1}(1) when N goes to the infinity and we have the bounds of c_{\alpha}. To obtain the asymptotic of \lambda_{N,\alpha} we give a theorem which suggests that the entries of T_N^{-1}(\varphi_{\alpha}) and T_N (\varphi^{-1}_\alpha) are closely related. If \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 > \frac{1}{2} we obtain the asymptotic of the minimal eigenvalue of T_N (\varphi_{\alpha_1}) T_N (\varphi_{\alpha_2}).
