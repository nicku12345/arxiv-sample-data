We study one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger operators \mathrm{S}(q) on the space L^{2}(\mathbb{R}) with potentials q being complex-valued generalized functions from the negative space H_{unif}^{-1}(\mathbb{R}). Particularly the class H_{unif}^{-1}(\mathbb{R}) contains periodic and almost periodic H_{loc}^{-1}(\mathbb{R})-functions. We establish an equivalence of the various definitions of the operators \mathrm{S}(q), investigate their approximation by operators with smooth potentials from the space L_{unif}^{1}(\mathbb{R}) and prove that the spectrum of each operator \mathrm{S}(q) lies within a certain parabola.
