In the field of applied mathematics the Fourier transform has developed into an important tool. It is a powerful method for solving partial differential equations. The Fourier transform provides also a technique for signal analysis where the signal from the original domain is transformed to the spectral or frequency domain. In the frequency domain many characteristics of the signal are revealed. With these facts in mind, we extend the Fourier transform in geometric algebra. We explicitly show detailed properties of the real Clifford geometric algebra Fourier transform (CFT), which we subsequently use to define and prove the uncertainty principle for Cl(3,0) multivector functions.
