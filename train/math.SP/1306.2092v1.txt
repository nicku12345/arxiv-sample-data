We generalize quaternion and Clifford Fourier transforms to general two-sided Clifford Fourier transforms (CFT), and study their properties (from linearity to convolution). Two general \textit{multivector square roots} \in \cl{p,q} \textit{of} -1 are used to split multivector signals, and to construct the left and right CFT kernel factors.   Keywords: Clifford Fourier transform, Clifford algebra, signal processing, square roots of -1 .
