We show that every Hankel operator H is unitarily equivalent to a pseudo-differential operator A of a special structure acting in the space L^2 ({\Bbb R}) . As an example, we consider integral operators H in the space L^2 ({\Bbb R}_{+})  with kernels P (\ln (t+s)) (t+s)^{-1} where P(x) is an arbitrary real polynomial of degree K. In this case, A is a differential operator of the same order K. This allows us to study spectral properties of Hankel operators H with such kernels. In particular, we show that the essential spectrum of H coincides with the whole axis for K odd, and it coincides with the positive half-axis for K even. In the latter case we additionally find necessary and sufficient conditions for the positivity of H. We also consider Hankel operators whose kernels have a strong singularity at some positive point. We show that spectra of such operators consist of the zero eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity and eigenvalues accumulating to +\infty and -\infty. We find the asymptotics of these eigenvalues.
