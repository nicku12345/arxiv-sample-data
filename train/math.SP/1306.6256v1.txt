The spectrum of periodic differential operators typically exhibits a band-gap structure. In this paper, we will consider perturbations to periodic differential operators and investigate the spectrum the perturbation induces in the gaps. More specifically, we consider the operator  L_0 =-\frac{1}{\eps_0(x,y,z)}\Delta  in \R^3 with \eps_0 periodic in all three directions. The perturbation is introduced by replacing \eps_0 by \eps_0+\eps_1 where we assume that \eps_1 is still periodic in one direction, but compactly supported in the remaining two directions, creating a line defect. We will show that even small perturbations \eps_1 lead to additional spectrum in the spectral gaps of the unperturbed operator L_0 and investigate some properties of the spectrum that is created.
