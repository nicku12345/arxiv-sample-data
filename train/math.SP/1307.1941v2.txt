We investigate the relationship between the Bergman shift operator and the support of the corresponding measure. We pay special attention to the situation when the measure of orthogonality is concentrated on a polynomial lemniscate. As an application of our new results, we obtain a ratio asymptotic result for a wide variety of measures supported on polynomial lemniscates.
