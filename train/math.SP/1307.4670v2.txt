We apply eigenvalue interlacing techniques for obtaining lower and upper bounds for the sums of Laplacian eigenvalues of graphs, and characterize equality. This leads to generalizations of, and variations on theorems by Grone, and Grone and Merris. As a consequence we obtain inequalities involving bounds for some well-known parameters of a graph, such as edge-connectivity, and the isoperimetric number.
