In this paper we study the regularized analytic torsion of finite volume hyperbolic manifolds. We consider sequences of coverings X_i of a fixed hyperbolic orbifold X_0. Our main result is that for certain sequences of coverings and strongly acyclic flat bundles, the analytic torsion divided by the index of the covering, converges to the L^2-torsion. Our results apply to certain sequences of arithmetic groups, in particular to sequences of principal congruence subgroups of \SO^0(d,1)(\Z) and to sequences of principal congruence subgroups or Hecke subgroups of Bianchi groups.
