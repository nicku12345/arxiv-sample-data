We give some graph theoretical formulas for the trace Tr_k(\mathbb {T}) of a tensor \mathbb {T} which do not involve the differential operators and auxiliary matrix. As applications of these trace formulas in the study of the spectra of uniform hypergraphs, we give a characterization (in terms of the traces of the adjacency tensors) of the k-uniform hypergraphs whose spectra are k-symmetric, thus give an answer to a question raised in [3]. We generalize the results in [3, Theorem 4.2] and [5, Proposition 3.1] about the k-symmetry of the spectrum of a k-uniform hypergraph, and answer a question in [5] about the relation between the Laplacian and signless Laplacian spectra of a k-uniform hypergraph when k is odd. We also give a simplified proof of an expression for Tr_2(\mathbb {T}) and discuss the expression for Tr_3(\mathbb {T}).
