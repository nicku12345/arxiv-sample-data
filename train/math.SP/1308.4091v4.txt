The main result of this work is as follows: for arbitrary pairwise disjoint finite intervals (\alpha_j,\beta_j)\subset[0,\infty), j=1,\dots,m and for arbitrary n\geq 2 we construct the family of periodic non-compact domains \{\Omega^\varepsilon\subset\mathbb{R}^n\}_{\varepsilon>0} such that the spectrum of the Neumann Laplacian in \Omega^\varepsilon has at least m gaps when \varepsilon is small enough, moreover the first m gaps tend to the intervals (\alpha_j,\beta_j) as \varepsilon\to 0. The constructed domain \Omega^\varepsilon is obtained by removing from \mathbb{R}^n a system of periodically distributed "trap-like" surfaces. The parameter \varepsilon characterizes the period of the domain \Omega^\varepsilon, also it is involved in a geometry of the removed surfaces.
