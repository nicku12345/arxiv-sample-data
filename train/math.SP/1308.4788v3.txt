For d \in \N and \Omega \ne \emptyset an open set in \R^d, we consider the eigenfunctions \Phi of the Dirichlet Laplacian -\Delta_\Omega of \Omega. If \Phi is associated with an eigenvalue below the essential spectrum of -\Delta_\Omega we provide estimates for the L_1-norm of \Phi in terms of its L_2-norm and spectral data. These L_1-estimates are then used in the comparison of the heat content of \Omega at time t>0 and the heat trace at times t' > 0, where a two-sided estimate is established. We furthermore show that all eigenfunctions of -\Delta_\Omega which are associated with a discrete eigenvalue of H_\Omega, belong to L_1(\Omega).
