Let (A_1,\cdots,A_n) and (B_1,\cdots,B_n) be n-tuples of commuting self-adjoint operators on Hilbert space. For functions f on \R^n satisfying certain conditions, we obtain sharp estimates of the operator norms (or norms in operator ideals) of f(A_1,\cdots,A_n)-f(B_1,\cdots,B_n) in terms of the corresponding norms of A_j-B_j, 1\le j\le n.   We obtain analogs of earlier results on estimates for functions of perturbed self-adjoint and normal operators. It turns out that for n\ge3, the methods that were used for self-adjoint and normal operators do not work. We propose a new method that works for arbitrary n.   We also get sharp estimates for quasicommutators f(A_1,\cdots,A_n)R-Rf(B_1,\cdots,B_n) in terms of norms of A_jR-RB_j, 1\le j\le n, for a bounded linear operator R.
