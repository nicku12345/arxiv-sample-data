We study the Schr\"odinger operator on L_2(\mathbb R^3) with periodic variable metric, and periodic electric and magnetic fields. It is assumed that the operator is reflection symmetric and the (appropriately defined) flux of the magnetic field is rational. Under these assumptions it is shown that the spectrum of the operator is absolutely continuous. Previously known results on absolute continuity for periodic operators were obtained for the zero magnetic flux.
