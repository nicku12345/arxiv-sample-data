We systematically derive general properties of continuous and holomorphic functions with values in closed operators, allowing in particular for operators with empty resolvent set. We provide criteria for a given operator-valued function to be continuous or holomorphic. This includes sufficient conditions for the sum and product of operator-valued holomorphic functions to be holomorphic.   Using graphs of operators, operator-valued functions are identified with functions with values in subspaces of a Banach space. A special role is thus played by projections onto closed subspaces of a Banach space, which depend holomorphically on a parameter.
