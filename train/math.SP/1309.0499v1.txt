In this paper we consider three arithmetic families of isospectral non-isometric Riemannian orbifolds and in each case derive an upper bound for the size of the family which is polynomial as a function of the volume of the orbifolds. The first family that we consider are those constructed by Vigneras' method. The second and third families are those whose covering groups are the minimal covolume arithmetic subgroups and maximal arithmetic subgroups of PGL_2(R)^a x PGL_2(C)^b.
