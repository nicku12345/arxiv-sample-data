The method of second order relative spectra has been shown to reliably approximate the discrete spectrum for a self-adjoint operator. We extend the method to normal operators and find optimal convergence rates for eigenvalues and eigenspaces. The convergence to eigenspaces is new, while the convergence rate for eigenvalues improves on the previous estimate by an order of magnitude.
