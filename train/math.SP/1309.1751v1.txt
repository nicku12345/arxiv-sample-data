Let L be the Hill operator or the one dimensional Dirac operator on the interval [0,\pi]. If L is considered with Dirichlet, periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions, then the corresponding spectra are discrete and for large enough |n| close to n^2  in the Hill case, or close to n, \; n\in \mathbb{Z} in the Dirac case, there are one Dirichlet eigenvalue \mu_n and two periodic (if n is even) or antiperiodic (if n is odd) eigenvalues \lambda_n^-, \, \lambda_n^+  (counted with multiplicity).   We give estimates for the asymptotics of the spectral gaps \gamma_n = \lambda_n^+ - \lambda_n^- and deviations  \delta_n =\mu_n - \lambda_n^+ in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the potentials. Moreover, for special potentials that are trigonometric polynomials we provide precise asymptotics of \gamma_n and \delta_n.
