In the first part of this manuscript a relationship between the spectrum of self-adjoint operator matrices and the spectra of their diagonal entries is found. This leads to enclosures for spectral points and in particular, enclosures for eigenvalues. We also consider graph invariant subspaces, and their corresponding angular operators. The existence of a bounded angular operator leads to basis properties of the first component of eigenvectors of operator matrices for which the corresponding eigenvalues lie in a half line. The results are applied to an example from magnetohydrodynamics.
