Define a (n^4+n^2)/2\times (n^4+n^2)/2 symmetric B. (ij)(kl) is an index where i,j,k,l\in [n], (ab) is an unordered pair and (kl) is an ordered pair when i\neq j, otherwise it is also an unordered pair. B((ij)(kl),(ab)(xy)) is equal to the number of permutations of S_n in which \min\{i,j\} maps to k, \max\{i,j\} maps to l, \min\{a,b\} maps to x and \max\{a,b\} maps to y. We will show that B has four distinct eigenvalues: (3/2)n!, n(n-3)!, (n-1)!/(n-3), 2n(n-2)! and the corresponding eigenspace dimensions are 1, {{n-1}\choose{2}}^2, ({{n-1}\choose{2}}-1)^2, (n-1)^2 respectively.
