In this article, we state the Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions around a singular value of hyperbolic type of the principal symbol of a self-adjoint semiclassical Toeplitz operator on a compact connected K\"{a}hler surface. These conditions allow the description of the spectrum of the operator in a fixed size neighbourhood of the singularity. We provide numerical computations for three examples, each associated to a different topology.
