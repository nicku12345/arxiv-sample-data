The current paper is devoted to the scattering theory of a class of continuum Schr\"{o}dinger operators with deterministic sparse potentials. We first establish the limiting absorption principle for both modified free resolvents and modified perturbed resolvents. This actually is a weak form of the classical limiting absorption principle. We then prove the existence and completeness of local wave operators, which, in particular, imply the existence of wave operators. Under additional assumptions on the sparse potential, we prove the completeness of wave operators. In the context of continuum Schr\"{o}dinger operators with sparse potentials, this paper gives the first proof of the completeness of wave operators.
