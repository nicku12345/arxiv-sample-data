We consider the Anderson model on a strip. Assuming that potentials have bounded density with considerable tails we get a lower bound for the fluctuations of the logarithm of the Green's function in a finite box. This implies an effective estimate by  \exp(CW^2)  for the localization length of the Anderson model on the strip of width  W . The results are obtained, actually, for a more general model with a non-local operator in the vertical direction.
