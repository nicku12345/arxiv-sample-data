A classical result by Cheng in 1976, improved later by Besson and Nadirashvili, says that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of the Schrodinger operator with a smooth potential on a compact Riemannian surface M are bounded in terms of the eigenvalue index and the genus of M. We prove that these multiplicity bounds hold for an L^p-potential, where p>1. We also discuss similar multiplicity bounds for Laplace eigenvalues on singular Riemannian surfaces.
