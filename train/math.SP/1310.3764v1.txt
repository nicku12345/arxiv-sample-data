In this paper we approximate a Schr\"odinger operator on L^2(\R) by Jacobi operators on \ell^2(\Z) to provide new proofs of sharp Lieb-Thirring inequalities for the powers \gamma=1/2 and \gamma=3/2. To this end we first investigate spectral inequalities for Jacobi operators. Using the commutation method we present a new, direct proof of a sharp inequality corresponding to a Lieb-Thirring inequality for the power 3/2 on \ell^2(\Z). We also introduce inequalities for higher powers of the eigenvalues as well as for matrix-valued potentials and compare our results to previously established bounds.
