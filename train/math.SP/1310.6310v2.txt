In this work we present an analogue of the inverse scattering for Canonical systems using theory of vessels and associated to them completely integrable systems. Analytic coefficients fits into this setting, significantly expanding the class of functions for which the inverse scattering exist. We also derive an evolutionary equation, arising from canonical systems, which describes the evolution of the logarithmic derivative of the tau function, associated to these systems
