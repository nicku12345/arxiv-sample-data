We prove the following higher-order Szego theorems: if a measure on the unit circle has absolutely continuous part w(\theta) and Verblunsky coefficients \alpha with square-summable variation, then for any positive integer m, \int (1-\cos \theta)^m \log w(\theta) d\theta is finite if and only if \alpha \in \ell^{2m+2}.   This is the first known equivalence result of this kind in the regime of very slow decay, i.e. with \ell^p conditions with arbitrarily large p. The usual difficulty of controlling higher-order sum rules is avoided by a new test sequence approach.
