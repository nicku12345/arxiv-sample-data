In this paper, eventually totally positive matrices (i.e. matrices all whose powers starting with some point are totally positive) are studied. We present a new approach to eventual total positivity which is based on the theory of eventually positive matrices. We mainly focus on the spectral properties of such matrices. We also study eventually J-sign-symmetric matrices and matrices, whose powers are P-matrices.
