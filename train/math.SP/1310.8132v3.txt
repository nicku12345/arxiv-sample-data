We prove uniform absence of point spectrum for CMV operators corresponding to the period doubling subshift. We also prove almost sure absence of point spectrum for CMV operators corresponding to a class of Sturmian subshifts. Lastly, we prove almost sure absence of point spectrum for CMV operators corresponding to some subshifts generated by a coding of a rotation.
