Let G be a simple graph on n vertices and e(G) edges. Consider Q(G) = D + A as the signless Laplacian of G, where A is the adjacency matrix and D is the diagonal matrix of the vertices degree of G. Let q_1(G) and q_2(G) be the first and the second largest eigenvalues of Q(G), respectively, and denote by S_{n}^{+} the star graph plus one edge. In this paper, we prove that inequality q_1(G)+ q_2(G) <= e(G)+3 is tighter for the graph S_{n}^{+} among all firefly graphs and also tighter to S_{n}^{+} than to the graphs K_{k} \vee \overline{K_{n-k}} recently presented by Ashraf, Omidi and Tayfeh-Rezaie. Also, we conjecture that the same inequality is tighter to S_{n}^{+} than any other graph on n vertices.
