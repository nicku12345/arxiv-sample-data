For the almost Mathieu operator (H_{\lambda,\alpha,\theta}u)_n=u_{n+1}+u_{n-1}+2\lambda \cos2\pi(\theta+n\alpha)u_n, Avila and Jitomirskaya guess that for a.e. \theta, H_{\lambda,\alpha,\theta} satisfies Anderson localization if  |\lambda| > e^{ \beta} , and they establish this for  |\lambda| > e^{\frac{16}{9} \beta}. In the present paper, we extend their result to regime  |\lambda| > e^{\frac{3}{2} \beta}.
