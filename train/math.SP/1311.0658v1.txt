For almost Mathieu operator (H_{\lambda,\alpha,\theta}u)_n=u_{n+1}+u_{n-1}+2\lambda \cos2\pi(\theta+n\alpha)u_n, the dry version of Ten Martini problem predicts that the spectrum \Sigma_{\lambda,\alpha} of  H_{\lambda,\alpha,\theta} has all gaps open for all \lambda\neq 0 and  \alpha \in \mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q}.   Avila and Jitomirskaya prove that \Sigma_{\lambda,\alpha} has all gaps open for Diophantine \alpha and 0<|\lambda|<1.   In the present paper, we show that \Sigma_{\lambda,\alpha} has all gaps open for all  \alpha \in \mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q} with small \lambda.
