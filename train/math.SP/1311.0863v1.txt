Avila and Jitomirskaya prove that the quasi-periodic Schr\"{o}dinger operator H_{\lambda v,\alpha,\theta} has purely absolutely continuous spectrum for \alpha  in sub-exponential regime (i.e., \beta(\alpha)=0) with small \lambda, if v is real analytic in a strip of real axis. In the present paper, we show that for all \alpha with 0<\beta(\alpha)<\infty, H_{\lambda v,\alpha,\theta} has purely absolutely continuous spectrum with small \lambda, if v is real analytic in strip  |\Im x|< C\beta , where C is a large absolute constant.
