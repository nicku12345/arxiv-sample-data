In this paper, we study the boundary traces of eigenfunctions on the boundary of a smooth and bounded domain. An identity derived by B\"acker, F\"urstburger, Schubert, and Steiner, expressing (in some sense) the asymptotic completeness of the set of boundary traces in a frequency window of size O(1), is proved both for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. We then prove a semiclassical generalization of this identity.
