Consider a semiclassical Hamiltonian H := h^{2} \Delta + V - E where \Delta is the positive Laplacian on \mathbb{R}^{d}, V \in C^{\infty}_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) and E > 0 is an energy level. We prove that under an appropriate dynamical hypothesis on the Hamilton flow corresponding to H, the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix S_{h}(V) define a measure on \mathbb{S}^{1} that converges to Lebesgue measure away from 1 \in \mathbb{S}^{1} as h \to 0.
