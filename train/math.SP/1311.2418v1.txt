We study sub-Dirac operators that are associated with left-invariant bracket-generating sub-Riemannian structures on compact quotients of nilpotent semi-direct products G=\mathbb{R}^n\rtimes_A\mathbb{R}. We will prove that these operators admit an L^2-basis of eigenfunctions. Explicit examples show that the spectrum of these operators can be non-discrete and that eigenvalues may have infinite multiplicity.
