We consider the discrete one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger operator H=H_0+V, where (H_0x)[n]=-(x[n+1]+x[n-1]-2x[n]) and V is a self-adjoint operator on \ell^2(\mathbb{Z}) with a decay property given by V extending to a compact operator from \ell^{\infty,-\beta}(\mathbb{Z}) to \ell^{1,\beta}(\mathbb{Z}) for some \beta\geq1. We give a complete description of the solutions to Hx=0, and Hx=4x, x\in\ell^{\infty,-\beta}(\mathbb{Z}). Using this description we give asymptotic expansions of the resolvent of H at the two thresholds 0 and 4. One of the main results is a precise correspondence between the solutions to Hx=0 and the leading coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the resolvent around 0. For the resolvent expansion we implement the expansion scheme of Jensen-Nenciu \cite{JN0, JN1} in the full generality.
