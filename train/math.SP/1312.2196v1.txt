We obtain several generalizations the Hellinger theorem about l^2 solutions of difference equations: instead of second order equations and  l^2-solutions, we consider second-order equations with matrix coefficients and their solutions in l^p,\; 1\le p\le \infty. In particular it is shown that for a certain class of symmetric difference equations an analog of this theorem holds for 1\le p \le 2, but it does not hold for p>2.
