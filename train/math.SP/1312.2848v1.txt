Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) of a third-order tensor is decomposition in a minimal number of rank-1 tensors. We call an algorithm algebraic if it is guaranteed to find the decomposition when it is exact and if it only relies on standard linear algebra (essentially sets of linear equations and matrix factorizations). The known algebraic algorithms for the computation of the CPD are limited to cases where at least one of the factor matrices has full column rank. In the paper we present an algebraic algorithm for the computation of the CPD in cases where none of the factor matrices has full column rank. In particular, we show that if the famous Kruskal condition holds, then the CPD can be found algebraically.
