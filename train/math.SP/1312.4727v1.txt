The truncated Hilbert transform with overlap H_T is an operator that arises in tomographic reconstruction from limited data, more precisely in the method of Differentiated Back-Projection (DBP). Recent work [1] has shown that the singular values of this operator accumulate at both zero and one. To better understand the properties of the operator and, in particular, the ill-posedness of the inverse problem associated with it, it is of interest to know the rates at which the singular values approach zero and one. In this paper, we exploit the property that H_T commutes with a second-order differential operator L_S and the global asymptotic behavior of its eigenfunctions to find the asymptotics of the singular values and singular functions of H_T.
