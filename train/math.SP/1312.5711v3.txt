Recently there has been a renewed interest in asymptotic Euler-MacLaurin formulas, partly due to applications to spectral theory of differential operators. Using elementary means, we recover such formulas for compactly supported smooth functions f on intervals, polygons, and 3-dimensional polytopes, where the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion are sums of differential operators involving only derivatives of f in directions normal to the faces of the polytope. Our formulas apply to wedges of any dimension. This paper builds on, and is motivated by, works of Guillemin, Sternberg, and others, in the past ten years.
