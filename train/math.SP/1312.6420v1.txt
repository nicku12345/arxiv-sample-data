This paper contains a re-evaluation of the spectral approach and factorizability for regular matrix polynomials. In addition, solvent theory is extended from the monic and comonic cases to the regular case. The classification of extended solvents (bisolvents) is shown to be equivalent to the classification of all the regular first order right factors for a general matrix polynomial.
