We consider asymptotics of the ground state energy of heavy atoms and molecules in the self-generatedl magnetic field. Namely, we consider H=((D-A)\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma})^2-V with V=\sum_{1\le m\le M} \frac{Z_m}{|x-y_m|} and a corresponding Multiparticle Quantum Hamiltonian  \mathsf{H}=\sum_{1\le n\le N} H_{x_n} +\sum_{1\le n < n'\le N}|x_n-x_n'|^{-1}  on the Fock space \wedge _{1\le n\le N} L^2(\mathbb{R}^3, \mathbb{C}^2). Here A=A^0+A' where A^0=\frac{1}{2}(-B x_2, B x_1,0) is an external magnetic field and A' is self-generated magnetic field. Then the ground state energy is given by  \mathsf{E}(A)=\inf \operatorname{Spec}(\mathsf{H})+\frac{1}{\alpha}\int |\nabla \times A'|^2\,dx  where the last term is the energy of magnetic field.   Under assumptions \alpha Z\le \kappa^* (with a small constant \kappa^*) and M=1 (atomic case) we study the ground State Energy \mathsf{E}^*=\inf_{A'}\mathsf{E}(A). We derive its asymptotics including Scott, and Schwinger and Dirac corrections (depending on B\ll Z^3).   In the next versions we will consider also molecules and related topics: an excessive negative charge, ionization energy and excessive positive charge when atoms can still bind into molecules.
