We consider a periodic system of domains coupled by small windows. In such domain we study the band spectrum of a Schroedinger operator subject to Neumann condition. We show that near each isolated eigenvalue of the similar operator but in the periodicity cell, there are several non-intersecting bands of the spectrum for the perturbed operator. We also discuss the position of the points at which the band functions attain the edges of each band.
