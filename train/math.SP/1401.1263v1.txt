Let G be a simple graph of order N. The normalized Laplacian Estrada index of G is defined as NEE(G)=\sum_{i=1}^Ne^{\lambda_i}, where \lambda_1,\lambda_2,\cdots,\lambda_N are the normalized Laplacian eigenvalues of G. In this paper, we give a tight lower bound for NEE of general graphs. We also calculate NEE for a class of treelike fractals, which contain some classical chemical trees as special cases. It is shown that NEE scales linearly with the order of the fractal, in line with a best possible lower bound for connected bipartite graphs.
