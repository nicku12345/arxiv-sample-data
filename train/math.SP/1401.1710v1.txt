Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian surface. Consider a family of L^2 normalized Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions, written in the semiclassical form -h_j^2\Delta_g \phi_{h_j} = \phi_{h_j}, whose eigenvalues satisfy h h_j^{-1} \in (1, 1 + hD] for D>0 a large enough constant. Let \mathbf{P}_h be a uniform probability measure on the L^2 unit-sphere S_h of this cluster of eigenfunctions and take u \in S_h. Given a closed curve \gamma \subset M, there exists C_{1}(\gamma, M), C_{2}(\gamma, M) > 0 and h_0>0 such that for all h \in (0, h_0], \begin{equation*}   C_1 h^{1/2} \leq \mathbf{E}_{h} \bigg[ \big| \int_{\gamma} u \, d \sigma \big| \bigg] \leq C_2 h^{1/2} . \end{equation*} This result contrasts the deterministic \mathcal{O}(1) upperbounds obtained by Chen-Sogge \cite{CS}, Reznikov \cite{Rez}, and Zelditch \cite{Zel}. Furthermore, we treat the higher dimensional cases and compute large deviation estimates. Under a measure zero assumption on the periodic geodesics in S^*M, we can consider windows of small width D=1 and establish a \mathcal{O}(h^{1/2}) estimate. Lastly, we treat probabilistic L^q restriction bounds along curves.
