We consider an elliptic self-adjoint first order differential operator L acting on pairs (2-columns) of complex-valued half-densities over a connected compact 3-dimensional manifold without boundary. The principal symbol of the operator L is assumed to be trace-free and the subprincipal symbol is assumed to be zero. Given a positive scalar weight function, we study the weighted eigenvalue problem for the operator L. The corresponding counting function (number of eigenvalues between zero and a positive lambda) is known to admit, under appropriate assumptions on periodic trajectories, a two-term asymptotic expansion as lambda tends to plus infinity and we have recently derived an explicit formula for the second asymptotic coefficient. The purpose of this paper is to establish the geometric meaning of the second asymptotic coefficient. To this end, we identify the geometric objects encoded within our eigenvalue problem - metric, nonvanishing spinor field and topological charge - and express our asymptotic coefficients in terms of these geometric objects. We prove that the second asymptotic coefficient of the counting function has the geometric meaning of the massless Dirac action.
