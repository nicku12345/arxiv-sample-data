For a sequence \{\alpha_n\}_{n=0}^\infty, we consider the Hankel operator \Gamma_\alpha, realised as the infinite matrix in \ell^2 with the entries \alpha_{n+m}. We consider the subclass of such Hankel operators defined by the "double positivity" condition \Gamma_\alpha\geq0, \Gamma_{S^*\alpha}\geq0; here S^*\alpha is the shifted sequence \{\alpha_{n+1}\}_{n=0}^\infty. We prove that in this class, the sequence \alpha is uniquely determined by the spectral shift function \xi_\alpha for the pair \Gamma_\alpha^2, \Gamma_{S^*\alpha}^2. We also describe the class of all functions \xi_\alpha arising in this way and prove that the map \alpha\mapsto\xi_\alpha is a homeomorphism in appropriate topologies.
