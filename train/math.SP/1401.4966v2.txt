For an m-order n-dimensional Hilbert tensor (hypermatrix) \mathcal{H}_n=(\mathcal{H}_{i_1i_2\cdots i_m}), \mathcal{H}_{i_1i_2\cdots i_m}=\frac1{i_1+i_2+\cdots+i_m-m+1},\ i_1,\cdots, i_m=1,2,\cdots,n its spectral radius is not larger than n^{m-1}\sin\frac{\pi}{n}, and an upper bound of its E-spectral radius is n^{\frac{m}2}\sin\frac{\pi}{n}. Moreover, its spectral radius is strictly increasing and its E-spectral radius is nondecreasing with respect to the dimension n. When the order is even, both infinite and finite dimensional Hilbert tensors are positive definite. We also show that the m-order infinite dimensional Hilbert tensor (hypermatrix) \mathcal{H}_\infty=(\mathcal{H}_{i_1i_2\cdots i_m}) defines a bounded and positively (m-1)-homogeneous operator from l^1 into l^p (1<p<\infty), and the norm of corresponding positively homogeneous operator is smaller than or equal to \frac{\pi}{\sqrt6}.
