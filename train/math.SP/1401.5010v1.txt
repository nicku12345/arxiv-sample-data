We prove a Hardy inequality for uniformly elliptic operators subject to Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions on domains \Omega with piecewiese smooth boundary in arbitrary Riemannian Manifolds (M, g). Employing an approach of E.B. Davies for the euclidean case, we show that it implies a sufficient geometric criterion under which the Laplace- Beltrami operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions \Delta^D has purely discrete spectrum on \Omega. We proceed to classify all non-compact \Omega with discrete spectrum up to a boundary regularity condition and show that these include for example polygons with ideal vertices in manifolds of negative curvature. This a new result for non-constant curvature.
