This paper deals with the derivation of a sharp estimate on the difference of traces of the one-parameter Schr\"odinger semigroup associated to the quantum isotropic harmonic oscillator. Denoting by H_{\infty,\kappa} the self-adjoint realization in L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), d \in \{1,2,3\} of the Schr\"odinger operator -\frac{1}{2} \Delta + \frac{1}{2} \kappa^{2}\vert \bold{x}\vert^{2}, \kappa>0 and by H_{L,\kappa}, L>0 the Dirichlet realization in L^{2}(\Lambda_{L}^{d}) where \Lambda_{L}^{d}:=\{\bold{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}:- \frac{L}{2} < x_{l} < \frac{L}{2},\,l=1,\ldots,d\}, we prove that the difference of traces \mathrm{Tr}_{L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})} \mathrm{e}^{-t H_{\infty,\kappa}} - \mathrm{Tr}_{L^{2}(\Lambda_{L}^{d})}\mathrm{e}^{-t H_{L,\kappa}}, t>0 has for L sufficiently large a Gaussian decay in L. Furthermore, the estimate that we derive is sharp in the two following senses: its behavior when t \downarrow 0 is similar to the one given by \mathrm{Tr}_{L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})}\ mathrm{e}^{-t H_{\infty,\kappa}} = (2\sinh( \frac{\kappa}{2}t))^{-d} and the exponential decay in t arising from \mathrm{Tr}_{L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})}\mathrm{e}^{-t H_{\infty,\kappa}} when t\uparrow \infty is preserved. For illustrative purposes, we give a simple application within the framework of quantum statistical mechanics.
