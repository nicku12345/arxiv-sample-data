We introduce a novel approach for defining a \delta'-interaction on a subset of the real line of Lebesgue measure zero which is based on Sturm-Liouville differential expression with measure coefficients. This enables us to establish basic spectral properties (e.g., self-adjointness, lower semiboundedness and spectral asymptotics) of Hamiltonians with \delta'-interactions concentrated on sets of complicated structures.
