We consider a non-selfadjoint h-differential model operator P_h in the semiclassical limit (h\rightarrow 0) subject to small random perturbations. Furthermore, we let the coupling constant \delta be \exp\{-\frac{1}{Ch}\}\leq \delta \ll h^{\kappa} for constants C,\kappa>0 suitably large. Let \Sigma be the closure of the range of the principal symbol. Previous results on the same model by Hager, Bordeaux-Montrieux and Sj\"ostrand show that if \delta \gg\exp\{-\frac{1}{Ch}\} there is, with a probability close to 1, a Weyl law for the eigenvalues in the interior of the of the pseudospectrum up to a distance \gg\left(-h\ln{\delta h}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}} to the boundary of \Sigma. We study the intensity measure of the random point process of eigenvalues and prove an h-asymptotic formula for the average density of eigenvalues. With this we show that there are three distinct regions of different spectral behavior in \Sigma: The interior of the of the pseudospectrum is solely governed by a Weyl law, close to its boundary there is a strong spectral accumulation given by a tunneling effect followed by a region where the density decays rapidly.
