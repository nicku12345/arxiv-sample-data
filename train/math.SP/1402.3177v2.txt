We prove three results giving sufficient and/or necessary conditions for discreteness of the spectrum of Schr\"odinger operators with non-negative matrix-valued potentials, i.e., operators acting on \psi\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{C}^d) by the formula H_V\psi:=-\Delta\psi+V\psi, where the potential V takes values in the set of non-negative Hermitian d\times d matrices. The first theorem provides a characterization of discreteness of the spectrum when the potential V is in a matrix-valued A_\infty class, thus extending a known result in the scalar case (d=1). We also discuss a subtlety in the definition of the appropriate matrix-valued A_\infty class. The second result is a sufficient condition for discreteness of the spectrum, which allows certain degenerate potentials, i.e., such that \det(V)\equiv0. To formulate the condition, we introduce a notion of oscillation for subspace-valued mappings. Our third and last result shows that if V is a 2\times2 real polynomial potential, then -\Delta+V has discrete spectrum if and only if the scalar operator -\Delta+\lambda has discrete spectrum, where \lambda(x) is the minimal eigenvalue of V(x).
