Schr\"odinger operator on half-line with complex potential and the corresponding evolution are studied within perturbation theoretic approach. The total number of eigenvalues and spectral singularities is effectively evaluated. Wave operators are constructed and a criterion is established for the similarity of perturbed and free propagators.
