In this work, we use scattering method to study the Kramers-Fokker-Planck equation with a potential whose gradient tends to zero at the infinity. For short-range potentials in dimension three, we show that complex eigenvalues do not accumulate at low-energies and establish the low-energy resolvent asymptotics. This combined with high energy pseudospectral estimates valid in more general situations gives the large-time asymptotics of the solution in weighted L^2 spaces.
