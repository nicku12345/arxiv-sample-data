In this paper, we extend some classes of structured matrices to higher order tensors. We discuss their relationships with positive semi-definite tensors and some other structured tensors. We show that every principal sub-tensor of such a structured tensor is still a structured tensor in the same class, with a lower dimension. The potential links of such structured tensors with optimization, nonlinear equations, nonlinear complementarity problems, variational inequalities and the nonnegative tensor theory are also discussed.
