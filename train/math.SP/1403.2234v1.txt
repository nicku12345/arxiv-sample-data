Given a function f on the positive half-line \R_+ and a sequence (finite or infinite) of points X=\{x_k\}_{k=1}^\omega in \R^n, we define and study matrices \kS_X(f)=\|f(|x_i-x_j|)\|_{i,j=1}^\omega called Schoenberg's matrices. We are primarily interested in those matrices which generate bounded and invertible linear operators S_X(f) on \ell^2(\N). We provide conditions on X and f for the latter to hold. If f is an \ell^2-positive definite function, such conditions are given in terms of the Schoenberg measure \sigma(f). We also approach Schoenberg's matrices from the viewpoint of harmonic analysis on \R^n, wherein the notion of the strong X-positive definiteness plays a key role. In particular, we prove that \emph{each radial \ell^2-positive definite function is strongly X-positive definite} whenever X is separated. We also implement a "grammization" procedure for certain positive definite Schoenberg's matrices. This leads to Riesz--Fischer and Riesz sequences (Riesz bases in their linear span) of the form \kF_X(f)=\{f(x-x_j)\}_{x_j\in X} for certain radial functions f\in L^2(\R^n). Examples of Schoenberg's operators with various spectral properties are presented.
