We study basic spectral properties of J-self-adjoint 2\times 2 block operator matrices. Using the linear resolvent growth condition, we obtain simple necessary conditions for the regularity of the critical point \infty. In particular, we present simple examples of operators having the singular critical point \infty. Also, we apply our results to the linearized operator arising in the study of soliton type solutions to the nonlinear relativistic Ginzburg-Landau equation.
