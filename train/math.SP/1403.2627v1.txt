The periodic eigenvalue problem for the differential operator (-1)^{m}d^{2m}/dx^{2m}+V is studied for complex-valued distribution V in the Sobolev space H^{-m\alpha}_{per}[-1,1]\;(m\in\mathbb{N},\; 0\leq\alpha<1). The following result is shown:   The periodic spectrum consists of a sequence (\lambda_{k})_{k\geq0} of complex eigenvalues satisfying the asymptotics (for any \varepsilon>0)    \lambda_{2n-1},\lambda_{2n}=n^{2m}\pi^{2m}+\hat{V}(0)\pm   \sqrt{\hat{V}(-2n)\hat{V}(2n)}+o(n^{m(2\alpha-1+\varepsilon)}),  where \hat{V}(k) denote the Fourier coefficients of V.
