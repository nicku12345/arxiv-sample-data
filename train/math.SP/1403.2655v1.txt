Let m\in \mathbb{N}, \alpha\in[0,1], and V be a 1-periodic complex-valued distribution in the negative Sobolev space H^{-m\alpha}[0,1]. The singular non-self-adjoint eigenvalue problem D^{2m}u+V u=\lambda u, D=-i d/dx, with semi-periodic boundary conditions is investigated. The uniform in V asymptotic and non-asymptotic eigenvalue estimates are found and proved. The case of periodic boundary conditions was studied by authors earlier.
