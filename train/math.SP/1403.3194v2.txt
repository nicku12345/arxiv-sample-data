We consider Anderson model H^{\omega}=-\Delta+V^{\omega} on \ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d) with decaying random potential. We study the point process \xi^{\omega}_{L,\lambda} associated with eigenvalues of H^{\omega}_{\Lambda_L}, the retriction of H^{\omega} to the finite cube \Lambda_L. Our result is that the weak limit points of \{\xi^{\omega}_{L,\lambda}\} are poisson point processes as L\to\infty.
