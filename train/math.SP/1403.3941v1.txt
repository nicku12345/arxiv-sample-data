We show that all Hankel operators H realized as integral operators with kernels h(t+s) in L^2 ({\Bbb R}_{+})  can be quasi-diagonalized as H= {\sf L}^* \Sigma {\sf L} . Here {\sf L} is the Laplace transform, \Sigma is the operator of multiplication by a function (distribution) \sigma(\lambda), \lambda\in {\Bbb R}. We find a scale of spaces of test functions where {\sf L}  acts as an isomorphism. Then {\sf L}^* is an isomorphism of the corresponding spaces of distributions. We show that h= {\sf L}^* \sigma which yields a one-to-one correspondence between kernels h(t) and sigma-functions \sigma(\lambda) of Hankel operators. The sigma-function of a self-adjoint Hankel operator H contains substantial information about its spectral properties. Thus we show that the operators H and \Sigma have the same numbers of positive and negatives eigenvalues. In particular, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for sign-definiteness of Hankel operators. These results are illustrated at examples of quasi-Carleman operators generalizing the classical Carleman operator with kernel h(t)=t^{-1} in various directions. The concept of the sigma-function directly leads to a criterion (equivalent of course to the classical Nehari theorem) for boundedness of Hankel operators. Our construction also shows that every Hankel operator is unitarily equivalent by the Mellin transform to a pseudo-differential operator with amplitude which is a product of functions of one variable only (of x\in{\Bbb R} and of its dual variable).
