We consider an off-diagonal self-adjoint finite rank perturbation of a self-adjoint operator in a complex separable Hilbert space \mathfrak{H}_0 \oplus \mathfrak{H}_1, where \mathfrak{H}_1 is finite dimensional. We describe the singular spectrum of the perturbed operator and establish a connection with solutions to the operator Riccati equation. In particular, we prove existence results for solutions in the case where the whole Hilbert space is finite dimensional.
