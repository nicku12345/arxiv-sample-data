The paper is a continuation of the study started in \cite{Yorzh1}. Schrodinger operators on finite compact metric graphs are considered under the assumption that the matching conditions at the graph vertices are of \delta type. Either an infinite series of trace formulae (provided that edge potentials are infinitely smooth) or a finite number of such formulae (in the cases of L_1 and C^M edge potentials) are obtained which link together two different quantum graphs under the assumption that their spectra coincide. Applications are given to the problem of recovering matching conditions for a quantum graph based on its spectrum.
