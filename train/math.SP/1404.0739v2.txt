We study the analog of semi-separable integral kernels in \cH of the type {equation*} K(x,x')={cases} F_1(x)G_1(x'), & a<x'< x< b, \\ F_2(x)G_2(x'), & a<x<x'<b, {cases} {equation*} where -\infty\leq a<b\leq \infty, and for a.e.\ x \in (a,b), F_j (x) \in \cB_2(\cH_j,\cH) and G_j(x) \in \cB_2(\cH,\cH_j) such that F_j(\cdot) and G_j(\cdot) are uniformly measurable, and {equation*} \|F_j(\cdot)\|_{\cB_2(\cH_j,\cH)} \in L^2((a,b)), \; \|G_j (\cdot)\|_{\cB_2(\cH,\cH_j)} \in L^2((a,b)), \quad j=1,2, {equation*} with \cH and \cH_j, j=1,2, complex, separable Hilbert spaces. Assuming that K(\cdot, \cdot) generates a trace class operator \bsK in L^2((a,b);\cH), we derive the analog of the Jost-Pais reduction theory that succeeds in proving that the Fredholm determinant {\det}_{L^2((a,b);\cH)}(\bsI - \alpha \bsK), \alpha \in \bbC, naturally reduces to appropriate Fredholm determinants in the Hilbert spaces \cH (and \cH_1 \oplus \cH_2).   Explicit applications of this reduction theory are made to Schr\"odinger operators with suitable bounded operator-valued potentials. In addition, we provide an alternative approach to a fundamental trace formula first established by Pushnitski which leads to a Fredholm index computation of a certain model operator.
