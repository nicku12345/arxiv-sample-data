We study the model operator \mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{A}} = (d/dt) + \mathbf{A} in L^2(\mathbb{R};\mathcal{H}) associated with the operator path \{A(t)\}_{t=-\infty}^{\infty}, where (\mathbf{A} f)(t) = A(t) f(t) for a.e.\ t\in\mathbb{R}, and appropriate f \in L^2(\mathbb{R};\mathcal{H}) (with \mathcal{H} a separable, complex Hilbert space). Denoting by A_{\pm} the norm resolvent limits of A(t) as t \to \pm \infty, our setup permits A(t) in \mathcal{H} to be an unbounded, relatively trace class perturbation of the unbounded self-adjoint operator A_-, and no discrete spectrum assumptions are made on A_{\pm}.   We introduce resolvent and semigroup regularized Witten indices of \mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{A}}, denoted by W_r and W_s, and prove that these regularized indices coincide with the Fredholm index of \mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{A}} whenever the latter is Fredholm.   In situations where \mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{A}} ceases to be a Fredholm operator in L^2(\mathbb{R};\mathcal{H}) we compute its resolvent (resp., semigroup) regularized Witten index in terms of the spectral shift function \xi(\,\cdot\,;A_+,A_-) associated with the pair (A_+, A_-) as follows: Assuming 0 to be a right and a left Lebesgue point of \xi(\,\cdot\,\, ; A_+, A_-), denoted by \xi_L(0_+; A_+,A_-) and \xi_L(0_-; A_+, A_-), we prove that 0 is also a right Lebesgue point of \xi(\,\cdot\,\, ; \mathbf{H_2}, \mathbf{H_1}), denoted by \xi_L(0_+; \mathbf{H_2}, \mathbf{H_1}), and that \begin{align*} W_r(\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{A}}) &= W_s(\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{A}}) \\ & = \xi_L(0_+; \mathbf{H_2}, \mathbf{H_1}) \\ & = [\xi_L(0_+; A_+,A_-) + \xi_L(0_-; A_+, A_-)]/2, \end{align*} the principal result of this paper.   In the special case where \dim(\mathcal{H}) < \infty, we prove that the Witten indices of \mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{A}} are either integer, or half-integer-valued.
