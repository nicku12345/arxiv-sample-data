We investigate the spectral properties of self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators with attractive \delta-interactions of constant strength \alpha > 0 supported on conical surfaces in {\mathbb R}^3. It is shown that the essential spectrum is given by [-\alpha^2/4,+\infty) and that the discrete spectrum is infinite and accumulates to -\alpha^2/4. Furthermore, an asymptotic estimate of these eigenvalues is obtained.
