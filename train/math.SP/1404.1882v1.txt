The exceptional X_{1}-Jacobi differential expression is a second-order ordinary differential expression with rational coefficients; it was discovered by G\'{o}mez-Ullate, Kamran and Milson in 2009. In their work, they showed that there is a sequence of polynomial eigenfunctions \left\{\widehat{P} _{n}^{(\alpha,\beta)}\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty} called the exceptional X_{1}-Jacobi polynomials. There is no exceptional X_{1}-Jacobi polynomial of degree zero. These polynomials form a complete orthogonal set in the weighted Hilbert space L^{2}((-1,1);\widehat{w}_{\alpha,\beta}), where \widehat{w}_{\alpha,\beta} is a positive rational weight function related to the classical Jacobi weight. Among other conditions placed on the parameters \alpha and \beta, it is required that \alpha,\beta>0. In this paper, we develop the spectral theory of this expression in L^{2}((-1,1);\widehat{w}_{\alpha,\beta}). We also consider the spectral analysis of the `extreme' non-exceptional case, namely when \alpha=0. In this case, the polynomial solutions are the non-classical Jacobi polynomials \left\{ P_{n}^{(-2,\beta)}\right\} _{n=2}^{\infty}. We study the corresponding Jacobi differential expression in several Hilbert spaces, including their natural L^{2} setting and a certain Sobolev space S where the full sequence \left\{ P_{n}^{(-2,\beta)}\right\} _{n=0}^{\infty} is studied and a careful spectral analysis of the Jacobi expression is carried out.
