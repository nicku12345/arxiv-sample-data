In this paper we study the asymptotic behaviour as \varepsilon\to 0 of the spectrum of the elliptic operator \mathcal{A}^\varepsilon=-{1\over b^\varepsilon}\mathrm{div}(a^\varepsilon\nabla) posed in a bounded domain \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n (n \geq 2) subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on \partial\Omega. When \varepsilon\to 0 both coefficients a^\varepsilon and b^\varepsilon become high contrast in a small neighborhood of a hyperplane \Gamma intersecting \Omega. We prove that the spectrum of \mathcal{A}^\varepsilon converges to the spectrum of an operator acting in L^2(\Omega)\oplus L^2(\Gamma) and generated by the operation -\Delta in \Omega\setminus\Gamma, the Dirichlet boundary conditions on \partial\Omega and certain interface conditions on \Gamma containing the spectral parameter in a nonlinear manner. The eigenvalues of this operator may accumulate at a finite point. Then we study the same problem, when \Omega is an infinite straight strip ("waveguide") and \Gamma is parallel to its boundary. We show that \mathcal{A}^\varepsilon has at least one gap in the spectrum when \varepsilon is small enough and describe the asymptotic behaviour of this gap as \varepsilon\to 0. The proofs are based on methods of homogenization theory.
