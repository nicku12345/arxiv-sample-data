We consider self-adjoint realizations of a second-order elliptic differential expression on {\mathbb R}^n with singular interactions of \delta and \delta^\prime-type supported on a compact closed smooth hypersurface in {\mathbb R}^n. In our main results we prove spectral asymptotics formulae with refined remainder estimates for the singular values of the resolvent difference between the standard self-adjoint realizations and the operators with a \delta and \delta^\prime-interaction, respectively. Our technique makes use of general pseudodifferential methods, classical results on spectral asymptotics of \psido's on closed manifolds and Krein-type resolvent formulae.
