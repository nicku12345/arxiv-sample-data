We present a class of weight functions  w on the circle  \mathbb{T}, called L\'evy-Khinchin-Schoenberg (LKS) weights, for which we are able to completely characterize (in terms of a capacitary inequality) all Fourier multipliers for the weighted space  L^{2}(\mathbb{T},w). We show that the multiplier algebra is nontrivial if and only if  1/w\in L^{1}(\mathbb{T}), and in this case multipliers satisfy the Spectral Localization Property (no "hidden spectrum"). On the other hand, the Muckenhoupt  (A_{2}) condition responsible for the basis property of exponentials  (e^{ikx}) is more or less independent of the Spectral Localization Property and LKS requirements. Some more complicated compositions of LKS weights are considered as well.
