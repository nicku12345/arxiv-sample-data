We estimate the size of the spectral gap at zero for some Hermitian block matrices. Included are quasi-definite matrices, quasi-semidefinite matrices (the closure of the set of the quasi-definite matrices) and some related block matrices which need not belong to either of these classes. Matrices of such structure arise in quantum models of possibly disordered systems with supersymmetry or graphene like symmetry. Some of the results immediately extend to infinite dimension.
