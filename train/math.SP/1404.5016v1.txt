In this paper, we show that there exists a positive density subsequence of orthonormal spherical harmonics which achieves the maximal Lp norm growth for 2<p<=6, therefore giving an example of a Riemannian surface supporting such subsequence of eigenfunctions. This answers the question proposed by Sogge and Zelditch (arXiv:1011.0215). Furthermore, we provide an explicit lower bound on the density in this example.
