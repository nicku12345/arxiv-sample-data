Let G be a finite connected simple graph. We define the moduli space of conformal structures on G. We propose a definition of conformally covariant operators on graphs, motivated by [25]. We provide examples of conformally covariant operators, which include the edge Laplacian and the adjacency matrix on graphs. In the case where such an operator has a nontrivial kernel, we construct conformal invariants, providing discrete counterparts of several results in [11,12] established for Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we show that the nodal sets and nodal domains of null eigenvectors are conformal invariants.
