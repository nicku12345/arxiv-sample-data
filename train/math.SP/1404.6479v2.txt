The notion of invariant operators, or Fourier multipliers, is discussed for densely defined operators on Hilbert spaces, with respect to a fixed partition of the space into a direct sum of finite dimensional subspaces. As a consequence, given a compact manifold endowed with a positive measure, we introduce a notion of the operator's full symbol adapted to the Fourier analysis relative to a fixed elliptic operator. We give a description of Fourier multipliers, or of operators invariant relative to the elliptic operator. We apply these concepts to study Schatten classes of operators and to obtain a formula for the trace of trace class operators. We also apply it to provide conditions for operators between Lp-spaces to be r-nuclear in the sense of Grothendieck.
