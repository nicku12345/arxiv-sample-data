The Carleman operator is defined as integral operator with kernel (t+s)^{-1} in the space L^2 ({\Bbb R}_{+}) . This is the simplest example of a Hankel operator which can be explicitly diagonalized. Here we study a class of self-adjoint Hankel operators (we call them quasi-Carleman operators) generalizing the Carleman operator in various directions. We find explicit formulas for the total number of negative eigenvalues of quasi-Carleman operators and, in particular, necessary and sufficient conditions for their positivity. Our approach relies on the concepts of the sigma-function and of the quasi-diagonalization of Hankel operators introduced in the preceding paper of the author.
