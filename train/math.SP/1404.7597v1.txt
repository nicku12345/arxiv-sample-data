It is established that every (not necessarily linear) 2-local ^*-homomorphism from a von Neumann algebra into a C^*-algebra is linear and a ^*-homomorphism. In the setting of (not necessarily linear) 2-local ^*-homomorphism from a compact C^*-algebra we prove that the same conclusion remains valid. We also prove that every 2-local Jordan ^*-homomorphism from a JBW^*-algebra into a JB^*-algebra is linear and a Jordan ^*-homomorphism.
