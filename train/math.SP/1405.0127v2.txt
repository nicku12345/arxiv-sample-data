Results are obtained for two minimization problems: I_k(c)=\inf \{\lambda_k(\Omega): \Omega\ \textup{open, convex in}\ \mathbb{R}^m,\ \mathcal{T}(\Omega)= c \}, and J_k(c)=\inf\{\lambda_k(\Omega): \Omega\ \textup{quasi-open in}\ \mathbb{R}^m, |\Omega|\le 1, \mathcal {P}(\Omega)\le c \}, where c>0, \lambda_k(\Omega) is the k'th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian acting in L^2(\Omega), |\Omega| denotes the Lebesgue measure of \Omega, \mathcal{P}(\Omega) denotes the perimeter of \Omega, and where \mathcal{T} is in a suitable class set functions. The latter include for example the perimeter of \Omega, and the moment of inertia of \Omega with respect to its center of mass.
