We generalize the classical Hardy and Faber-Krahn inequalities to arbitrary functions on a convex body \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n, not necessarily vanishing on the boundary \partial \Omega. This reduces the study of the Neumann Poincar\'e constant on \Omega to that of the cone and Lebesgue measures on \partial \Omega; these may be bounded via the curvature of \partial \Omega. A second reduction is obtained to the class of harmonic functions on \Omega. We also study the relation between the Poincar\'e constant of a log-concave measure \mu and its associated K. Ball body K_\mu. In particular, we obtain a simple proof of a conjecture of Kannan--Lov\'asz--Simonovits for unit-balls of \ell^n_p, originally due to Sodin and Lata{\l}a--Wojtaszczyk.
