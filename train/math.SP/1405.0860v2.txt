In a recent work, the authors studied various Borel equivalence relations defined on the Polish space {\rm{SA}}(H) of all (not necessarily bounded) self-adjoint operators on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space H. In this paper we study the domain equivalence relation E_{\rm{dom}}^{{\rm{SA}}(H)} given by AE_{\rm{dom}}^{{\rm{SA}}(H)}B\Leftrightarrow {\rm{dom}}{A}={\rm{dom}}{B} and determine its exact Borel complexity: E_{\rm{dom}}^{{\rm{SA}}(H)} is an F_{\sigma} (but not K_{\sigma}) equivalence relation which is continuously bireducible with the orbit equivalence relation E_{\ell^{\infty}}^{\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}} of the standard Borel group \ell^{\infty}=\ell^{\infty}(\mathbb{N},\mathbb{R}) on \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}. This, by Rosendal's Theorem, shows that E_{\rm{dom}}^{{\rm{SA}}(H)} is universal for K_{\sigma} equivalence relations. Moreover, we show that generic self-adjoint operators have purely singular continuous spectrum equal to \mathbb{R}.
