We revisit and extend known bounds on operator-valued functions of the type  T_1^{-z} S T_2^{-1+z}, \quad z \in \ol \Sigma = \{z\in\bbC\,|\, \Re(z) \in [0,1]\},  under various hypotheses on the linear operators S and T_j, j=1,2. We particularly single out the case of self-adjoint and sectorial operators T_j in some separable complex Hilbert space \cH_j, j=1,2, and suppose that S (resp., S^*) is a densely defined closed operator mapping \dom(S) \subseteq \cH_1 into \cH_2 (resp., \dom(S^*) \subseteq \cH_2 into \cH_1), relatively bounded with respect to T_1 (resp., T_2^*). Using complex interpolation methods, a generalized polar decomposition for S, and Heinz's inequality, the bounds we establish lead to inequalities of the following type, \begin{align*} & \big\|\ol{T_2^{-x}ST_1^{-1+x}}\big\|_{\cB(\cH_1,\cH_2)} \leq N_1 N_2 e^{(\theta_1 + \theta_2) [x(1-x)]^{1/2}} \\ & \quad \times \big\|ST_1^{-1}\big\|_{\cB(\cH_1,\cH_2)}^{1-x} \, \big\|S^*(T_2^*)^{-1}\big\|_{\cB(\cH_2,\cH_1)}^{x}, \quad x \in [0,1], \end{align*} assuming that T_j have bounded imaginary powers, that is, for some N_j\ge 1 and \theta_j \ge 0,  \big\|T_j^{is}\big\|_{\cB(\cH)} \leq N_j e^{\theta_j |s|}, \quad s \in \bbR, \; j=1,2.  We also derive analogous bounds with \cB(\cH_1,\cH_2) replaced by trace ideals, \cB_p(\cH_1, \cH_2), p \in [1,\infty). The methods employed are elementary, predominantly relying on Hadamard's three-lines theorem and Heinz's inequality.
