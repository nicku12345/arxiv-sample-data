We review the quadratic form of the Laplace operator in 3 dimensions in spehrical coordinates which acts on the transverse components of vector functions. Operators, acting on the parametrizing functions of one of the transverse components with angular momentum 1 and 2, appear to be fourth order symmetric differential operators with deficiency indices (1,1). We develop self-adjoint extensions of these operators and propose correspondent extensions for the initial quadratic form. The relevant scalar product for the angular momentum 2 differs from the original product in the space of vector functions, but nevertheless it is still local in radial variable.
