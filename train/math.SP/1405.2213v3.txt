On a closed weighted Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Bakry-\'{E}mery Ricci curvature, it is shown that the ratio of the k-th to first eigenvalues of the weighted Laplacian is dominated by 641k^2, using an argument via the Cheeger constant. While improving the previous exponential upper bound, the order of k here is optimal, and hence answers an open question of Funano. This approach works still on a compact finite-dimensional Alexandrov space of nonnegative curvature and proves affirmatively a conjecture of Funano and Shioya asserting a dimension free upper bound for eigenvalue ratios in that setting.
