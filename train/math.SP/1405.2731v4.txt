Some special Hilbert spaces are introduced to present the class of infinitesimal operators with complete minimal non-basis family of eigenvectors. The discrete Hardy inequality plays an important role in the proposed approach. The construction complement the results of G.Q.~Xu et al.~\cite{Xu} (2005) and H.~Zwart~\cite{Zwart} (2010) on the Riesz basis property of eigenvectors (eigenspaces) of infinitesimal operators. Our results are extended to the case of operators on some Banach spaces.
