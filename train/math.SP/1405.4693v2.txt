We study the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian \Delta_{\mu}=\frac{d}{d\mu}\frac{d}{dx} for a Borel probability measure \mu on the interval [0,1] by a technique that follows the treatment of the classical eigenvalue equation f'' = -\lambda f with homogeneous Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions. For this purpose we introduce generalized trigonometric functions that depend on the measure \mu. In particular, we consider the special case where \mu is a self-similar measure like e.g. the Cantor measure. We develop certain trigonometric identities that generalize the addition theorems for the sine and cosine functions. In certain cases we get information about the growth of the suprema of normalized eigenfunctions. For several special examples of \mu we compute eigenvalues of \Delta_{\mu} and L_{\infty}- and L_2-norms of eigenfunctions numerically by applying the formulas we developed.
