In this paper we prove that a positive commutator between a positive compact operator A and a positive operator B is in the radical of the Banach algebra generated by A and B. Furthermore, on every at least three-dimensional Banach lattice we construct finite rank operators A and B satisfying AB\geq BA\geq 0 such that the commutator AB-BA is not contained in the radical of the Banach algebra generated by A and B. These two results now completely answer to two open questions published in [4]. We also obtain relevant results in the case of the Volterra and the Donoghue operator.
