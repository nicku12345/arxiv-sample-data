We study the Schr\"{o}dinger operator with a constant magnetic field in the exterior of a compact domain in euclidean space. Functions in the domain of the operator are subject to a boundary condition of the third type (a magnetic Robin condition). In addition to the Landau levels, we obtain that the spectrum of this operator consists of clusters of eigenvalues around the Landau levels and that they do accumulate to the Landau levels from below. We give a precise asymptotic formula for the rate of accumulation of eigenvalues in these clusters, which is independent of the boundary condition.
