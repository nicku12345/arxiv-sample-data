We study the connection between the Liv\v{s}ic class of functions s(z) that are the characteristic functions of densely defined symmetric operators \dot A with deficiency indices (1, 1), the characteristic functions S(z) (the M\"obius transform of s(z)) of a maximal dissipative extension T of \dot A (determined by the von Neumann parameter \kappa of the extension relative to an appropriate basis in the deficiency subspaces) and the transfer functions W_\Theta(z) of a conservative L-system \Theta with the main operator T. It is shown that under a natural hypothesis S(z) and W_\Theta(z) are reciprocal to each other. In particular, when \kappa=0, W_\Theta(z)=\frac{1}{S(z)}=-\frac{1}{s(z)}. It is established that the impedance function of a conservative L-system with the main operator T coincides with the function from the Donoghue class if and only if the von Neumann parameter vanishes (\kappa=0). Moreover, we introduce the generalized Donoghue class and obtain the criteria for an impedance function to belong to this class. All results are illustrated by a number of examples.
