Recently Penskoi [J. Geom. Anal. 25 (2015), 2645-2666, arXiv:1308.1628] generalized the well known two-parametric family of Lawson tau-surfaces \tau_{r,m} minimally immersed in spheres to a three-parametric family T_{a,b,c} of tori and Klein bottles minimally immersed in spheres. It was remarked that this family includes surfaces carrying all extremal metrics for the first non-trivial eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the torus and on the Klein bottle: the Clifford torus, the equilateral torus and surprisingly the bipolar Lawson Klein bottle \tilde{\tau}_{3,1}. In the present paper we show in Theorem 1 that this three-parametric family T_{a,b,c} includes in fact all bipolar Lawson tau-surfaces \tilde{\tau}_{r,m}. In Theorem 3 we show that no metric on generalized Lawson surfaces is maximal except for \tilde{\tau}_{3,1} and the equilateral torus.
