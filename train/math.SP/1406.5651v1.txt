We establish the Lifschitz-type singularity around the bottom of the spectrum for the integrated density of states for a class of subordinate Brownian motions in presence of the nonnegative Poissonian random potentials, possibly of infinite range, on the Sierpi\'nski gasket. We also study the long-time behaviour for the corresponding averaged Feynman-Kac functionals.
