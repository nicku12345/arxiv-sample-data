For a semibounded self-adjoint operator  T  and a compact self-adjoint operator  S  acting on a complex separable Hilbert space of infinite dimension, we study the difference  D(\lambda) := E_{(-\infty, \lambda)}(T+S) - E_{(-\infty, \lambda)}(T), \, \lambda \in \mathbb{R} , of the spectral projections associated with the open interval  (-\infty, \lambda) .   In the case when  S  is of rank one, we show that  D(\lambda)  is unitarily equivalent to a block diagonal operator  \Gamma_{\lambda} \oplus 0 , where  \Gamma_{\lambda}  is a bounded self-adjoint Hankel operator, for all  \lambda \in \mathbb{R}  except for at most countably many  \lambda .   If, more generally,  S  is compact, then we obtain that  D(\lambda)  is unitarily equivalent to an essentially Hankel operator (in the sense of Mart\'{\i}nez-Avenda\~no) on  \ell^{2}(\mathbb{N}_{0})  for all  \lambda \in \mathbb{R}  except for at most countably many  \lambda .
