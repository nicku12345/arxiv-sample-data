We derive an optimal eigenvalue ratio estimate for finite weighted graphs satisfying the curvature-dimension inequality CD(0,\infty). This estimate is independent of the size of the graph and provides a general method to obtain higher order spectral estimates. The operation of taking Cartesian products is shown to be an efficient way for constructing new weighted graphs satisfying CD(0,\infty). We also discuss a higher order Cheeger constant ratio estimate and related topics about expanders.
