Recently, Zhao and Yang introduced centrosymmetric tensors. In this paper, we further introduce skew centrosymmetric tensors and centrosymmetric Cauchy tensors, and discuss properties of these three classes of structured tensors. Some sufficient and necessary conditions for a tensor to be centrosymmetric or skew centrosymmetric are given. We show that, a general tensor can always be expressed as the sum of a centrosymmetric tensor and a skew centrosymmetric tensor. Some sufficient and necessary conditions for a Cauchy tensor to be centrosymmetric or skew centrosymmetric are also given. Spectral properties on H-eigenvalues and H-eigenvectors of centrosymmetric, skew centrosymmetric and centrosymmetric Cauchy tensors are discussed. Some further questions on these tensors are raised.
