Let A be a 0-sectorial operator with a bounded H^\infty(\Sigma\_\sigma)-calculus for some \sigma \in (0,\pi), e.g. a Laplace type operator on L^p(\Omega),\: 1 < p < \infty, where \Omega is a manifold or a graph. We show that A has a H{\"o}rmander functional calculus if and only if certain operator families derived from the resolvent (\lambda - A)^{-1}, the semigroup e^{-zA}, the wave operators e^{itA} or the imaginary powers A^{it} of A are R-bounded in an L^2-averaged sense. If X is an L^p(\Omega) space with 1 \leq p < \infty, R-boundedness reduces to well-known estimates of square sums.
