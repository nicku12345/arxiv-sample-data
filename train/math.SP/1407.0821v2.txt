We prove Paley-Littlewood decompositions for the scales of fractional powers of 0-sectorial operators A on a Banach space which correspond to Triebel-Lizorkin spaces and the scale of Besov spaces if A is the classical Laplace operator on L^p(\mathbb{R}^n).We use the H^\infty-calculus, spectral multiplier theorems and generalized square functions on Banach spaces and apply our results to Laplace-type operators on manifolds and graphs, Schr\"odinger operators and Hermite expansion.We also give variants of these results for bisectorial operators and for generators of groups with a bounded H^\infty-calculus on strips.
