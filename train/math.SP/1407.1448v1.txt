The paper is concerned with the doubling estimates and vanishing order of the Steklov eigenfunction on the boundary of a smooth boundary domain \mathbb R^n. The eigenfunction is given by a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We improve the doubling property shown by Lin and Bellova \cite{BL}. Furthermore, we show that the vanishing order of Steklov eigenfunction is everywhere less than C\lambda where \lambda is the Steklov eigenvalue and C depends only on \Omega.
