We consider Sturm-Liouville equation y^{\prime\prime}+(\lambda-q)y=0 where q\in L^{1}[0,a]. We obtain various conditions on the Fourier coefficients of q such that the periodic eigenvalues having the form given by Titchmarsh are asymptotically simple. Under these conditions, we give some asymptotic estimates for the spectral gaps.
