A self-adjoint operator A in a Krein space \bigl({\mathcal K},[\,\cdot\,,\cdot\,]\bigr) is called partially fundamentally reducible if there exist a fundamental decomposition {\mathcal K} = {\mathcal K}_+ [\dot{+}] {\mathcal K}_- (which does not reduce A) and densely defined symmetric operators S_+ and S_- in the Hilbert spaces \bigl({\mathcal K}_+,[\,\cdot\,,\cdot\,]\bigr) and \bigl({\mathcal K}_-,-[\,\cdot\,,\cdot\,]\bigr), respectively, such that each S_+ and S_- has defect numbers (1,1) and the operator A is a self-adjoint extension of S =S_+ \oplus (-S_-) in the Krein space \bigl({\mathcal K},[\,\cdot\,,\cdot\,]\bigr). The operator A is interpreted as a coupling of operators S_+ and -S_- relative to some boundary triples \bigl({\mathbb C},\Gamma_0^+,\Gamma_1^+\bigr) and \bigl({\mathbb C},\Gamma_0^-,\Gamma_1^-\bigr). Sufficient conditions for a nonnegative partially fundamentally reducible operator A to be similar to a self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space are given in terms of the Weyl functions m_+ and m_- of S_+ and S_- relative to the boundary triples \bigl({\mathbb C},\Gamma_0^+,\Gamma_1^+\bigr) and \bigl({\mathbb C},\Gamma_0^-,\Gamma_1^-\bigr). Moreover, it is shown that under some asymptotic assumptions on m_+ and m_- all positive self-adjoint extensions of the operator S are similar to self-adjoint operators in a Hilbert space.
