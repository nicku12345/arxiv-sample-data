Quasiperiodic Jacobi operators arise as mathematical models of quasicrystals and in more general studies of structures exhibiting aperiodic order. The spectra of these self-adjoint operators can be quite exotic, such as Cantor sets, and their fine properties yield insight into associated dynamical systems. Quasiperiodic operators can be approximated by periodic ones, the spectra of which can be computed via two finite dimensional eigenvalue problems. Since long periods are necessary to get detailed approximations, both computational efficiency and numerical accuracy become a concern. We describe a simple method for numerically computing the spectrum of a period-K Jacobi operator in O(K^2) operations, and use it to investigate the spectra of Schr\"odinger operators with Fibonacci, period doubling, and Thue-Morse potentials.
