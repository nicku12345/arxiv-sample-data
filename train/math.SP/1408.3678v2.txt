Let \mathcal{P}_{\Omega,tA} denoted the Pauli operator on a bounded open region \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2 with Dirichlet boundary conditions and magnetic potential A scaled by some t>0. Assume that the corresponding magnetic field B=\mathrm{curl}\,A satisfies B\in L\log L(\Omega)\cap C^\alpha(\Omega_0) where \alpha>0 and \Omega_0 is an open subset of \Omega of full measure (note that, the Orlicz space L\log L(\Omega) contains L^p(\Omega) for any p>1). Let \mathsf{N}_{\Omega,tA}(\lambda) denote the corresponding eigenvalue counting function. We establish the strong field asymptotic formula \[ \mathsf{N}_{\Omega,tA}(\lambda(t))=\frac{t}{2\pi}\int_{\Omega}\lvert B(x)\rvert\,dx\;+o(t) \] as t\to+\infty, whenever \lambda(t)=Ce^{-ct^\sigma} for some \sigma\in(0,1) and c,C>0. The corresponding eigenfunctions can be viewed as a localised version of the Aharonov-Casher zero modes for the Pauli operator on \mathbb{R}^2.
