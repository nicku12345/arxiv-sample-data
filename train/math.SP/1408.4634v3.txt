In this paper, we give a further study on B-tensors and introduce doubly B-tensors that contain B-tensors. We show that they have similar properties, including their decompositions and strong relationship with strictly (doubly) diagonally dominated tensors. As an application, the properties of B-tensors are used to localize real eigenvalues of some tensors, which would be very useful in verifying the positive semi-definiteness of a tensor.
