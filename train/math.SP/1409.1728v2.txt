Let H_0 and H be a pair of self-adjoint operators satisfying some standard assumptions of scattering theory. It is known from previous work that if \lambda belongs to the absolutely continuous spectrum of H_0 and H, then the difference of spectral projections D(\lambda)=1_{(-\infty,0)}(H-\lambda)-1_{(-\infty,0)}(H_0-\lambda) in general is not compact and has non-trivial absolutely continuous spectrum. In this paper we consider the compact approximations D_\varepsilon(\lambda) of D(\lambda), given by D_\varepsilon(\lambda)=\psi_\varepsilon(H-\lambda)-\psi_\varepsilon(H_0-\lambda), where \psi_\varepsilon(x)=\psi(x/\varepsilon) and \psi(x) is a smooth real-valued function which tends to \mp1/2 as x\to\pm\infty. We prove that the eigenvalues of D_\varepsilon(\lambda) concentrate to the absolutely continuous spectrum of D(\lambda) as \varepsilon\to+0. We show that the rate of concentration is proportional to |\log\varepsilon| and give an explicit formula for the asymptotic density of these eigenvalues. It turns out that this density is independent of \psi. The proof relies on the analysis of Hankel operators.
