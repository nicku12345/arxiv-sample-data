Let (M, {g}) be a compact, d-dimensional Riemannian manifold without boundary. Suppose further that (M,g) is either two dimensional and has no conjugate points or (M,g) has non-positive sectional curvature. The goal of this note is to show that the long time parametrix obtained for such manifolds by B\'erard can be used to prove a logarithmic improvement for the remainder term of the Riesz means of the counting function of the Laplace operator.
