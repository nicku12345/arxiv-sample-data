Partial differential equations (PDE) on manifolds arise in many areas, including mathematics and many applied fields. Among all kinds of PDEs, the Poisson-type equations including the standard Poisson equation and the related eigenproblem of the Laplace-Beltrami operator are of the most important. Due to the complicated geometrical structure of the manifold, it is difficult to get efficient numerical method to solve PDE on manifold. In the paper, we propose a method called point integral method (PIM) to solve the Poisson-type equations from point clouds with convergence guarantees. In PIM, the key idea is to derive the integral equations which approximates the Poisson-type equations and contains no derivatives but only the values of the unknown function. The latter makes the integral equation easy to be approximated from point cloud. In the paper, we explain the derivation of the integral equations, describe the point integral method and its implementation, and present the numerical experiments to demonstrate the convergence of PIM.
