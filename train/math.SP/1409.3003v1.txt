In this article we prove the strict monotonicity of the spectral radius of weakly irreducible nonnegative tensors. As an application, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for an interval hull of tensors to be contained in the set of all strong \mathcal{M}-tensors. We also establish some properties of \mathcal{M}-tensors. Finally, we consider some problems related to interval hull of positive (semi)definite tensors and P(P_0)-tensors.
