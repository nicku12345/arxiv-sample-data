We consider a Schr\"odinger Operator with a matrix potential defined in L_2^m(F) by the differential expression\begin{equation*}   L(\phi(x))=(-\Delta+V(x))\phi(x)   \end{equation*}and the Neumann boundary condition, where F is the d dimensional rectangle and V is a martix potential, m\geqslant 2, d\geqslant 2. We obtain the asymptotic formulas of arbitrary order for the single resonance eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger operator in L_2^m(F).
