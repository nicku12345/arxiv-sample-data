Given Banach spaces \mathcal{X} and \mathcal{Y} and Banach space operators A\in L(\mathcal{X}) and B\in L(\mathcal{Y}). The generalized derivation \delta_{A,B} \in L(L(\mathcal{Y},\mathcal{X})) is defined by \delta_{A,B}(X)=(L_{A}-R_{B})(X)=AX-XB. This paper is concerned with the problem of the transferring the left polaroid property, from operators A and B^{*} to the generalized derivation \delta_{A,B}. As a consequence, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for \delta_{A,B} to satisfy generalized a-Browder's theorem and generalized a-Weyl's theorem. As application, we extend some recent results concerning Weyl type theorems.
