This paper analyses the periodic spectrum of Schr\"odinger's equation -f''+qf=\lambda f when the potential is real, periodic, random and subject to the invariant measure \nu_N^\beta of the periodic KdV equation. This \nu_N^\beta is the modified canonical ensemble, as given by Bourgain ({Comm. Math. Phys.} {166} (1994), 1--26), and \nu_N^\beta satisfies a logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Associated concentration inequalities control the fluctuations of the periodic eigenvalues (\lambda_n). For \beta, N>0 small, there exists a set of positive \nu_N^\beta measure such that (\pm \sqrt{2(\lambda_{2n}+\lambda_{2n-1})})_{n=0}^\infty gives a sampling sequence for Paley--Wiener space PW(\pi ) and the reproducing kernels give a Riesz basis. Let (\mu_j)_{j=1}^\infty be the tied spectrum; then (2\sqrt{\mu_j}-j) belongs to a Hilbert cube in \ell^2 and is distributed according to a measure that satisfies Gaussian concentration for Lipschitz functions. The sampling sequence (\sqrt{\mu_j})_{j=1}^\infty arises from a divisor on the spectral curve, which is hyperelliptic of infinite genus. The linear statistics \sum_j g(\sqrt{\lambda_{2j}}) with test function g\in PW(\pi) satisfy Gaussian concentration inequalities.
