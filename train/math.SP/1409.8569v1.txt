Let L_0 be a bounded operator on a Banach space, and consider a perturbation L=L_0+K, where K is compact. This work is concerned with obtaining bounds on the number of eigenvalues of L in subsets of the complement of the essential spectrum of L_0, in terms of the approximation numbers of the perturbing operator K. Our results can be considered as wide generalizations of classical results on the distribution of eigenvalues of compact operators, which correspond to the case L_0=0. They also extend previous results on operators in Hilbert space. Our method employs complex analysis and a new finite-dimensional reduction, allowing us to avoid using the existing theory of determinants in Banach spaces, which would require strong restrictions on K. Several open questions regarding the sharpness of our results are raised, and an example is constructed showing that there are some essential differences in the possible distribution of eigenvalues of operators in general Banach spaces, compared to the Hilbert space case.
