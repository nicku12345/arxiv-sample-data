We study the lower bounds for the principal frequency of the p-Laplacian on N-dimensional Euclidean domains. For p>N, we obtain a lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the p-Laplacian in terms of its inradius, without any assumptions on the topology of the domain. Moreover, we show that a similar lower bound can be obtained if p > N-1 assuming the boundary is connected. This result can be viewed as a generalization of the classical bounds for the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator on simply connected planar domains.
