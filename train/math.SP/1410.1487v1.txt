We consider self-adjoint extensions of differential operators of the type  (-\frac{d^2}{dr^2} + \frac{l(l+1)}{r^2})^3  on the real semi-axis for l=1,2 with two kinds of boundary conditions: first that nullify the value of a function and its first derivative and second that nullify the 4th (l=1) or the 3rd (l=2) derivative. We calculate the expressions for the correponding resolvents and derive spectral decompositions. These types of boundary conditions are interesting from the physical point of view, especially the second ones, which give an example of emergence of long-range action in exchange for a singularity at the origin.
