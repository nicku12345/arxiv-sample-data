In this article, we get the spectral solution \mathcal{P}_{\mu}^{m} of operators m(\mathcal{L}, -\Delta_\mathfrak{z}), the joint functional calculus of the sub-Laplacian and Laplacian on the centre of M\'etivier group. Then, we give some group-analogues of the Thomas-Stein-type restriction theorem, asserting the mix-norm boundness of the restriction operators \mathcal{P}_{\mu}^{m} for two classes of functions m=(a^\alpha+b^\beta)^\gamma and m=(1+a^\alpha+b^\beta)^\gamma with \alpha, \beta>0, \gamma\neq0.
