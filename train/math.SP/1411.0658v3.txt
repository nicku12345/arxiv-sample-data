Let (M, g) be a compact smooth Riemannian manifold. We obtain new off-diagonal estimates as {\lambda} tend to infinity for the remainder in the pointwise Weyl Law for the kernel of the spectral projector of the Laplacian onto functions with frequency at most {\lambda}. A corollary is that, when rescaled around a non self-focal point, the kernel of the spectral projector onto the frequency interval (\lambda, \lambda + 1] has a universal scaling limit as {\lambda} goes to infinity (depending only on the dimension of M). Our results also imply that if M has no conjugate points, then immersions of M into Euclidean space by an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions with frequencies in (\lambda, \lambda + 1] are embeddings for all {\lambda} sufficiently large.
