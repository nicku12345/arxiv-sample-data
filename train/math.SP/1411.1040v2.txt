We consider products of random matrices that are small, independent identically distributed perturbations of a fixed matrix T_0. Focusing on the eigenvalues of T_0 of a particular size we obtain a limit to a SDE in a critical scaling. Previous results required T_0 to be a (conjugated) unitary matrix so it could not have eigenvalues of different modulus. From the result we can also obtain a limit SDE for the Markov process given by the action of the random products on the flag manifold. Applying the result to random Schr\"odinger operators we can improve some result by Valko and Virag showing GOE statistics for the rescaled eigenvalue process of a sequence of Anderson models on long boxes. In particular we solve a problem posed in their work.
