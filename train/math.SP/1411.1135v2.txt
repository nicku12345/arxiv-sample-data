In this paper, we study lower bounds for higher eigenvalues of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian on a bounded domain \Omega in \mathbb{R}^n. It is well known that the k-th Dirichlet eigenvalue \lambda_k obeys the Weyl asymptotic formula, that is, \[ \lambda_k\sim\frac{4\pi^2}{(\omega_n\mathrm{vol}\Omega)^\frac{2}{n}}k^\frac{2}{n}\qquad\hbox{as}\quad k\rightarrow\infty, \] where \mathrm{vol}\Omega is the volume of \Omega. In view of the above formula, P\'{o}lya conjectured that \[ \lambda_k\gs\frac{4\pi^2}{(\omega_n\mathrm{vol}\Omega)^\frac{2}{n}}k^\frac{2}{n}\qquad\hbox{for}\quad k\in\mathbb{N}. \] This is the well-known conjecture of P\'{o}lya. Studies on this topic have a long history with much work.In particular, one of the more remarkable achievements in recent tens years has been achieved by Li and Yau [Comm. Math. Phys. 88 (1983), 309--318]. They solved partially the conjecture of P\'{o}lya with a slight difference by a factor n/(n+2). Here, following the argument of Li and Yau on the whole, we shall thoroughly solve the above conjecture.
