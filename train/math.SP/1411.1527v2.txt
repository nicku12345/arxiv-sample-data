We consider the generalized Anderson Model \Delta+\sum_{n\in\mathcal{N}}\omega_n P_n, where \mathcal{N} is a countable set, \{\omega_n\}_{n\in\mathcal{N}} are i.i.d random variables and P_n are rank N<\infty projections. For these models we prove theorem analogous to that of Jak\v{s}i\'{c}-Last on the equivalence of the trace measure \sigma_n(\cdot)=tr(P_nE_{H^\omega}(\cdot)P_n) for n\in\mathcal{N} a.e \omega. Our model covers the dimer and polymer models.
