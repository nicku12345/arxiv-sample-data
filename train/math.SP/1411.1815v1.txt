We consider functions f(A,B) of noncommuting self-adjoint operators A and B that can be defined in terms of double operator integrals. We prove that if f belongs to the Besov class B_{\be,1}^1(\R^2), then we have the following Lipschitz type estimate in the trace norm: \|f(A_1,B_1)-f(A_2,B_2)\|_{\bS_1}\le\const(\|A_1-A_2\|_{\bS_1}+\|B_1-B_2\|_{\bS_1}). However, the condition f\in B_{\be,1}^1(\R^2) does not imply the Lipschitz type estimate in the operator norm.
