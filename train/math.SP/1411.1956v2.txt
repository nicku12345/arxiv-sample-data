Let \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2 be the exterior of a convex polygon whose side lengths are \ell_1,...,\ell_M. For \alpha>0, let H^\Omega_\alpha denote the Laplacian in \Omega, u\mapsto -\Delta u, with the Robin boundary conditions \partial u/\partial\nu =\alpha u, where \nu is the exterior unit normal at the boundary of \Omega. We show that, for any fixed m\in\mathbb{N}, the mth eigenvalue E^\Omega_m(\alpha) of H^\Omega_\alpha behaves as \[ E^\Omega_m(\alpha)=-\alpha^2+\mu^D_m +\mathcal{O}\Big(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt\alpha}\Big) \quad {as \alpha tends to +\infty}, \] where \mu^D_m stands for the mth eigenvalue of the operator D_1\oplus...\oplus D_M and D_n denotes the one-dimensional Laplacian f\mapsto -f" on (0,\ell_n) with the Dirichlet boundary conditions.
