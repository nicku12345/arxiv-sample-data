We study the asymptotic behavior of the counting function of tensor products of operators, in the cases where the factors are either pseudodifferential operators on closed manifolds, or pseudodifferential operators of Shubin type on \mathbb{R}^n, respectively. We obtain, in particular, the sharpness of the remainder term in the corresponding Weyl formulae, which we prove by means of the analysis of some explicit examples.
