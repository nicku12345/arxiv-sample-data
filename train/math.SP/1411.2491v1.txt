We consider the measure-geometric Laplacians \Delta^{\mu} with respect to atomless compactly supported Borel probability measures \mu as introduced by Freiberg and Z\"ahle in 2002 and show that the harmonic calculus of \Delta^{\mu} can be deduced from the classical (weak) Laplacian. We explicitly calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of \Delta^{\mu}. Further, it is shown that there exists a measure-geometric Laplacian whose eigenfunctions are the Chebyshev polynomials and illustrate our results through specific examples of fractal measures, namely Salem and inhomogeneous self-similar Cantor measures.
