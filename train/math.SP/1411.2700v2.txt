We determine accurate asymptotics for the low-lying eigenvalues of the Robin Laplacian when the Robin parameter goes to -\infty. The two first terms in the expansion have been obtained by K. Pankrashkin in the 2D-case and by K. Pankrashkin and N. Popoff in higher dimensions. The asymptotics display the influence of the scalar curvature and the splitting between every two consecutive eigenvalues. The analysis is based on the approach developed by Fournais-Helffer for the semi-classical magnetic Laplacian. We also propose a WKB construction as a candidate for the ground state energy.
