We consider second order elliptic systems of partial differential equations subject to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. We prove analyticity of the elementary symmetric functions of the eigenvalues, and compute Hadamard-type formulas for such functions. Then we provide a characterization of criticality of the domain under volume constraint, and prove that if the system is rotation invariant, then balls are critical domains for all those functions.
