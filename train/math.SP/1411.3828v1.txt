For non-Hermitian equilateral q-pointed star-shaped quantum graphs of paper I [Can. J. Phys. 90, 1287 (2012), arXiv 1205.5211] we show that due to certain dynamical aspects of the model as controlled by the external, rotation-symmetric complex Robin boundary conditions, the spectrum is obtainable in a closed asymptotic-expansion form, in principle at least. Explicit formulae up to the second order are derived for illustration, and a few comments on their consequences are added.
