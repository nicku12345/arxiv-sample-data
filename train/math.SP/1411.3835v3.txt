We study the question to what extent spectral information of a Schr\"odinger operator on a finite, compact metric graph subject to standard or \delta-type matching conditions can be recovered from a corresponding Titchmarsh-Weyl function on the boundary of the graph. In contrast to the case of ordinary or partial differential operators, the knowledge of the Titchmarsh-Weyl function is in general not sufficient for recovering the complete spectrum of the operator (or the potentials on the edges). However, it is shown that those eigenvalues with sufficiently high (depending on the cyclomatic number of the graph) multiplicities can be recovered. Moreover, we prove that under certain additional conditions the Titchmarsh-Weyl function contains even the full spectral information.
