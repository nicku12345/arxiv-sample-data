Let (X,g) be a compact manifold with conic singularities. Taking \Delta_g to be the Friedrichs extension of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, we examine the singularities of the trace of the half-wave group e^{- i t \sqrt{ \smash[b]{\Delta_g}}} arising from strictly diffractive closed geodesics. Under a generic nonconjugacy assumption, we compute the principal amplitude of these singularities in terms of invariants associated to the geodesic and data from the cone point. This generalizes the classical theorem of Duistermaat-Guillemin on smooth manifolds and a theorem of Hillairet on flat surfaces with cone points.
