Let G be a graph of order n \geq 3 with sequence degree given as d_{1}(G) \geq ... \geq d_{n}(G) and let \mu_1(G),..., \mu_n(G) and q_1(G), ..., q_{n}(G) be the Laplacian and signless Laplacian eigenvalues of G arranged in non increasing order, respectively. Here, we consider the Grone's inequality [R. Grone, Eigenvalues and degree sequences of graphs, Lin. Multilin. Alg. 39 (1995) 133--136]  \sum_{i=1}^{k} \mu_{i}(G) \geq \sum_{i=1}^{k} d_{i}(G)+1 and prove that for k=2, the equality holds if and only if G is the star graph S_{n}. The signless Laplacian version of Grone's inequality is known to be true when k=1. In this paper, we prove that it is also true for k=2, that is, q_{1}(G)+q_{2}(G) \geq d_1(G)+d_2(G)+1 with equality if and only if G is the star S_{n} or the complete graph K_{3}. When k \geq 3, we show a counterexample.
