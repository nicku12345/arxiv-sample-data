We consider a non-selfadjoint h-differential model operator P_h in the semiclassical limit (h\rightarrow 0) subject to random perturbations with a small coupling constant \delta. Assume that \exp(-\frac{1}{Ch}) < \delta \ll h^{\kappa} for constants C,\kappa>0 suitably large. Let \Sigma be the closure of the range of the principal symbol. We study the 2-point intensity measure of the random point process of eigenvalues of the randomly perturbed operator P_h^{\delta} and prove an h-asymptotic formula for the average 2-point density of eigenvalues. With this we show that two eigenvalues of P_h^{\delta} in the interior of \Sigma exhibit close range repulsion and long range decoupling.
