We consider compact Hankel operators realized in \ell^2(\mathbb Z_+) as infinite matrices \Gamma with matrix elements h(j+k). Roughly speaking, we show that, for all \alpha>0, the singular values s_{n} of \Gamma satisfy the bound s_{n}= O(n^{-\alpha}) as n\to \infty provided h(j)= O(j^{-1}(\log j)^{-\alpha}) as j\to \infty. These estimates on s_{n} are sharp in the power scale of \alpha. Similar results are obtained for Hankel operators \mathbf\Gamma realized in L^2(\mathbb R_+) as integral operators with kernels \mathbf h(t+s). In this case the estimates of singular values of \mathbf\Gamma are determined by the behavior of \mathbf h(t) as t\to 0 and as t\to\infty.
