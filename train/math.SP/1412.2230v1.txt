We study the eigenvalue distribution of a large Jordan block subject to a small random Gaussian perturbation. A result by E.B. Davies and M. Hager shows that as the dimension of the matrix gets large, with probability close to 1, most of the eigenvalues are close to a circle. We study the expected eigenvalue density of the perturbed Jordan block in the interior of that circle and give a precise asymptotic description.
