We consider compact Hankel operators realized in  \ell^2(\mathbb Z_+) as infinite matrices \Gamma with matrix elements h(j+k). Roughly speaking, we show that if h(j)\sim (b_{1}+ (-1)^j b_{-1}) j^{-1}(\log j)^{-\alpha} as j\to \infty for some \alpha>0, then the eigenvalues of \Gamma satisfy \lambda_{n}^{\pm} (\Gamma)\sim c^{\pm} n^{-\alpha} as n\to \infty. The asymptotic coefficients c^{\pm} are explicitly expressed in terms of the asymptotic coefficients b_{1}  and b_{-1}. Similar results are obtained for Hankel operators \mathbf \Gamma realized in  L^2(\mathbb R_+) as integral operators with kernels \mathbf h(t+s). In this case the asymptotics of eigenvalues \lambda_{n}^{\pm} (\mathbf \Gamma) are determined by the behaviour of \mathbf h(t) as t\to 0 and as t\to \infty.
