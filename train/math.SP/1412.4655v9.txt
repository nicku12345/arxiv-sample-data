Let J_\sigma be the Dunkl harmonic oscillator on {\mathbb{R}} (\sigma>-\frac{1}{2}). For 0<u<1 and \xi>0, it is proved that, if \sigma>u-\frac{1}{2}, then the operator U=J_\sigma+\xi|x|^{-2u}, with appropriate domain, is essentially self-adjoint in L^2({\mathbb{R}},|x|^{2\sigma} dx), the Schwartz space {\mathcal{S}} is a core of \overline U^{1/2}, and \overline U has a discrete spectrum, which is estimated in terms of the spectrum of \overline{J_\sigma}. A generalization J_{\sigma,\tau} of J_\sigma is also considered by taking dif\/ferent parameters \sigma and \tau on even and odd functions. Then extensions of the above result are proved for J_{\sigma,\tau}, where the perturbation has an additional term involving, either the factor x^{-1} on odd functions, or the factor x on even functions. Versions of these results on {\mathbb{R}}_+ are derived.
