Let \Gamma be a finitely generated group acting by probability measure preserving maps on the standard Borel space (X,\mu). We show that if H\leq\Gamma is a subgroup with relative spectral radius greater than the global spectral radius of the action, then H acts with finitely many ergodic components and spectral gap on (X,\mu). This answers a question of Shalom who proved this for normal subgroups.
