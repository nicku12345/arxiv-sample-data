The paper deals with the Dirac operator generated on the finite interval [0,\pi] by the differential expression -B\mathbf{y}'+Q(x)\mathbf{y}, where  B=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\-1&0\end{pmatrix},\qquad Q(x)=\begin{pmatrix}q_1(x)&q_2(x)\\q_3(x)&q_4(x)\end{pmatrix},  and the entries q_j(x) belong to~L_p[0,\pi] for some p\geqslant 1. The classes of regular and strongly regular operators of this form are defined, depending on the boundary conditions. The asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of such operators are obtained with remainders depending on~p. It it is proved that the system of eigen and associated functions of a regular operator forms a Riesz basis with parentheses in the space~(L_2[0,\pi])^2 and the usual Riesz basis, provided that the operator is strongly regular.
