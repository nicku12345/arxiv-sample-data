For operators generated by a certain class of infinite band matrices with matrix elements we establish a characterization of the resolvent set in terms of polynomial solutions of the underlying higher order finite difference equations. This enables us to describe some asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding systems of vector orthogonal polynomials on the resolvent set.
