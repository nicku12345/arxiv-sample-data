Let \mathcal{A} be an order t dimension m\times n\times \cdots \times n tensor over complex field. In this paper, we study some {generalized inverses} of \mathcal{A}, the {k-T-idempotent tensors} and the idempotent tensors based on the general tensor product. Using the tensor generalized inverse, some solutions of the equation \mathcal{A}\cdot x^{t-1}=b are given, where x and b are dimension n and m vectors, respectively. The {generalized inverses} of some block tensors, the eigenvalues of {k-T-idempotent tensors} and idempotent tensors are given. And the relation between the generalized inverses of tensors and the k-T-idempotent tensors is also showed.
