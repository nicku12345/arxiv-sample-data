It is constructively proved that for class A_{r,\gamma}=\{q\in L_{1,loc}(0,1): q\leq 0, \int_0^1 rq^\gamma\,dx\leqslant 1\}, where r\in C[0,1] is uniformly positive weight and \gamma>1, there exists a unique potential \hat q\in A_{r,\gamma} such that minimal eigenvalue \lambda_0(\hat q) of boundary problem -y"+\hat qy=\lambda y, y(0)=y(1)=0  is equal to M_{r,\gamma}=\sup_{q\in A_{r,\gamma}}\lambda_0(q). For case \gamma=1 we obtain that there exists a unique potential \hat q\in\Gamma_{r,\gamma} with analogous property. Here \Gamma_{r,\gamma} is a closure of A_{r,\gamma} in the space W_{2,loc}^{-1}(0,1) of generalized functions.
