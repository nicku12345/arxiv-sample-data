The paper studies the Hill--Schr\"odinger operators with potentials in the space H^\omega \subset H^{-1}\left(\mathbb{T}, \mathbb{R}\right). The main results completely describe the sequences arising as the lengths of spectral gaps of these operators. The space H^\omega coincides with the H\"ormander space H^{\omega}_2\left(\mathbb{T}, \mathbb{R}\right) with the weight function \omega(\sqrt{1+\xi^{2}}) if \omega belongs to Avakumovich's class \mathrm{OR}. In particular, if the functions \omega are power, then these spaces coincide with the Sobolev spaces. The functions \omega may be nonmonotonic.
