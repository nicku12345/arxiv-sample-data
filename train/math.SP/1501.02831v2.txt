We introduce a notion of (S+N)-triangular operators in the Hilbert space using some basic ideas from triangular representation theory. Our notion generalizes the well-known notion of the spectral operators so that many properties of the (S+N)-triangular operators coincide with those of spectral operators. At the same time we show that wide classes of operators are (S+N)-triangular.
