We consider a bounded linear operator T on a complex Banach space X and show that its spectral radius r(T) satisfies r(T) < 1 if all sequences (< x',T^nx>)_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0} (x \in X, x' \in X') are, up to a certain rearrangement, contained in a principal ideal of the space c_0 of sequences which converge to 0. From this result we obtain generalizations of theorems of G. Weiss and J. van Neerven. We also prove a related result on C_0-semigroups.
