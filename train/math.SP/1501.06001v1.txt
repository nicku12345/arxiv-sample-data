The almost Mathieu operator is the discrete Schr\"odinger operator H_{\alpha,\beta,\theta} on \ell^2(\mathbb{Z}) defined via (H_{\alpha,\beta,\theta}f)(k) = f(k + 1) + f(k - 1) + \beta \cos(2\pi \alpha k + \theta) f(k). We derive explicit estimates for the eigenvalues at the edge of the spectrum of the finite-dimensional almost Mathieu operator. We furthermore show that the (properly rescaled) m-th Hermite function \phi_m is an approximate eigenvector of this operator, and that it satisfies the same properties that characterize the true eigenvector associated to the m-th largest eigenvalue. Moreover, a properly translated and modulated version of \phi_m is also an approximate eigenvector of this operator, and it satisfies the properties that characterize the true eigenvector associated to the m-th largest (in modulus) negative eigenvalue. The results hold at the edge of the spectrum, for any choice of \theta and under very mild conditions on \alpha and \beta. We also give precise estimates for the size of the "edge", and extend some of our results to the infinite dimensional case. The ingredients for our proofs comprise Taylor expansions, basic time-frequency analysis, Sturm sequences, and perturbation theory for eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Numerical simulations demonstrate the tight fit of the theoretical estimates.
