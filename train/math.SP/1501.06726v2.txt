In this article, we present various new results on Cauchy tensors and Hankel tensors. { We first introduce the concept of generalized Cauchy tensors which extends Cauchy tensors in the current literature, and provide several conditions characterizing positive semi-definiteness of generalized Cauchy tensors with nonzero entries.} As a consequence, we show that Cauchy tensors are positive semi-definite if and only if they are SOS (Sum-of-squares) tensors.} Furthermore, we prove that all positive semi-definite Cauchy tensors are completely positive tensors, which means every positive semi-definite Cauchy tensor can be decomposed { as} the sum of nonnegative rank-1 tensors. We also establish that all the H-eigenvalues of nonnegative Cauchy tensors are nonnegative. Secondly, we present new mathematical properties of Hankel tensors. { We prove that an even order Hankel tensor is Vandermonde positive semi-definite if and only if its associated plane tensor is positive semi-definite. We also show that, if the Vandermonde rank of a Hankel tensor \mathcal{A} is less than the dimension of the underlying space, then positive semi-definiteness of \mathcal{A} is equivalent to the fact that \mathcal{A} is a complete Hankel tensor, and so, is further equivalent to the SOS property of \mathcal{A}. Lastly, we introduce a new structured tensor called Cauchy-Hankel tensors, which is a special case of Cauchy tensors and Hankel tensors simultaneously.} Sufficient and necessary conditions are established for an even order Cauchy-Hankel tensor to be positive definite. Final remarks are listed at the end of the paper.
