Given a general symmetric elliptic operator  L\_{a} := \sum\_{k,,j=1}^d \p\_k (a\_{kj} \p\_j) + \sum\_{k=1}^d a\_k \p\_k - \p\_k(\overline{a\_k} .) + a\_0we define the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann (D-t-N) operator with partial data, i.e., data supported in a part of the boundary. We prove positivity, L^p-estimates and domination properties for the semigroup associated with this D-t-N operator. Given L\_a  and L\_b of the previous type with bounded measurable coefficients a = \{a\_{kj}, \ a\_k, a\_0 \} and b = \{b\_{kj}, \ b\_k, b\_0 \}, we prove that if their partial D-t-N operators (with a\_0 and b\_0 replaced by a\_0 -\la and b\_0 -\la) coincide for all \la, then the operators L\_a and L\_b, endowed with Dirichlet, mixed or Robin boundary conditions are unitary equivalent. In the case of the Dirichlet boundary conditions, this result was proved recently by Behrndt and Rohleder \cite{BR12} for Lipschitz continuous coefficients. We provide a different proof which works for bounded measurable coefficients and other boundary conditions.
