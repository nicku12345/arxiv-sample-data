We order lowest mixed Dirichlet-Neumann eigenvalues of right triangles according to which sides we apply the Dirichlet conditions. It is generally true that Dirichlet condition on a superset leads to larger eigenvalues, but it is nontrivial to compare e.g. the mixed cases on triangles with just one Dirichlet side. As a consequence of that order we also classify the lowest Neumann and Dirichlet eigenvalues of rhombi according to their symmetry/antisymmetry with respect to the diagonal.   We also give an order for the mixed Dirichlet-Neumann eigenvalues on arbitrary triangle, assuming two Dirichlet sides. The single Dirichlet side case is conjectured to also have appropriate order, following right triangular case.
