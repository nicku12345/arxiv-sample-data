In this paper we study the analytic torsion for a complete oriented hyperbolic manifold of finite volume. This requires the definition of a regularized trace of heat operators. We use the Selberg trace formula to study the asymptotic behavior of the regularized trace for small time. The main result of the paper is a new approach to deal with the weighted orbital integrals on the geometric side of the trace formula.
