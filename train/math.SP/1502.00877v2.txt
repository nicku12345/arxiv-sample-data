We consider the Laplacian on a class of smooth domains \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{\nu}, \nu\ge 2, with attractive Robin boundary conditions: \[ Q^\Omega_\alpha u=-\Delta u, \quad \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\alpha u \text{ on } \partial\Omega, \ \alpha>0, \] where n is the outer unit normal, and study the asymptotics of its eigenvalues E_{j}(Q^\Omega_\alpha) as well as some other spectral properties for \alpha\to+\infty We work with both compact domains and non-compact ones with a suitable behavior at infinity. For domains with compact C^2 boundaries and fixed j, we show that \[ E_{j}(Q^\Omega_\alpha)=-\alpha^2+\mu_j(\alpha)+{\mathcal O}(\log \alpha), \] where \mu_j(\alpha) is the j^{\mbox{th}} eigenvalue, as soon as it exists, of -\Delta_{S}-(\nu-1)\alpha H with (-\Delta_{S}) and H being respectively the positive Laplace-Beltrami operator and the mean curvature on \partial\Omega. Analogous results are obtained for a class of domains with non-compact boundaries. In particular, we discuss the existence of eigenvalues in non-compact domains and the existence of spectral gaps for periodic domains. We also show that the remainder estimate can be improved under stronger regularity assumptions.   The effective Hamiltonian -\Delta_{S}-(\nu-1)\alpha H enters the framework of semi-classical Schr\"odinger operators on manifolds, and we provide the asymptotics of its eigenvalues in the limit \alpha\to+\infty under various   geometrical assumptions. In particular, we describe several cases for which our asymptotics provides gaps between the eigenvalues of Q^\Omega_\alpha for large \alpha.
