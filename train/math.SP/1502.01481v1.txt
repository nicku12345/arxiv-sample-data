We deal with the Dirac operator \mathcal L_{P,U} generated in the space \mathbb H=(L_2[0,\pi])^2 by differential expression \begin{gather*} \ell_P(\mathbf y)=B\mathbf y'+P\mathbf y,\quad   B = \begin{pmatrix} -i & 0 \\ 0 & i   \end{pmatrix},   \qquad   P(x) = \begin{pmatrix} p_1(x) & p_2(x) \\ p_3(x) & p_4(x)   \end{pmatrix},   \qquad   \mathbf y(x)=\begin{pmatrix}y_1(x)\\ y_2(x)\end{pmatrix}, \end{gather*} and regular boundary conditions  U(\mathbf y)=\begin{pmatrix}u_{11} & u_{12}\\ u_{21} & u_{22}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}y_1(0)\\ y_2(0)\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}u_{13} & u_{14}\\ u_{23} & u_{24}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}y_1(\pi)\\ y_2(\pi)\end{pmatrix}=0.  The entries of a matrix P suppose to be summable on the segment [0,\pi] complex-valued functions. It is proved, that the operator \mathcal L_{P,U} has purely discrete spectrum \{\lambda_n\}_{n\in\mathbb Z} and \lambda_n=\lambda_n^0+o(1) as |n|\to\infty. Here \{\lambda_n^0\}_{n\in\mathbb Z} be the spectrum of operator \mathcal L_{0,U} with zero potential and the same boundary conditions. In case this boundary conditions are strictly regular the spectrum of \mathcal L_{P,U} is asymptotically simple. In this case the system of eigen and associated functions of operator \mathcal L_{P,U} forms Riesz basis in \mathbb H. In case of regular but not strictly regular boundary conditions all eigenvalues of the operator \mathcal L_{0,U} have multiplicity equal to 2. In this case we give full proof of Riesz basicity of corresponding two-dimensional root subspaces of the operator \mathcal L_{0,U}.
