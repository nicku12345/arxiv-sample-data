We show that the measure of the spectrum of Schr\"odinger operator with potential defined by non-constant function over any minimal aperiodic finite subshift tends to zero, as the coupling constant tends to infinity. We also obtained a quantitative upper bound for the measure of the spectrum. This follows from a result we proved for ergodic Schr\"odinger operators with finitely valued potentials under two conditions on the recurrence property of the shift. We also show that one of these conditions is necessary for such result.
