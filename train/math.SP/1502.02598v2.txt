The weighted Kohn Laplacian \Box_\varphi is a natural second order elliptic operator associated to a weight \varphi:\mathbb{C}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R} and acting on (0,1)-forms, which plays a key role in several questions of complex analysis. We consider here the case of model monomial weights in \mathbb{C}^2, i.e.,  \varphi(z,w):=\sum_{(\alpha,\beta)\in\Gamma}|z^\alpha w^\beta|^2,  where \Gamma\subseteq \mathbb{N}^2 is finite. Our goal is to prove coercivity estimates of the form \Box_\varphi\geq \mu^2, where \mu:\mathbb{C}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R} acts by pointwise multiplication on (0,1)-forms, and the inequality is in the sense of self-adjoint operators. We recently proved (arxiv.org:1502.00865) how to derive from \mu-coercivity estimates for \Box_\varphi pointwise bounds for the weighted Bergman kernel associated to \varphi. Here we introduce a technique to establish \mu-coercivity with  \mu(z,w)=c(1+|z|^a+|w|^b) \qquad(a,b\geq0), where a,b\geq0 depend (and are easily computable from) \Gamma. As a corollary we also prove that, for a wide class of model monomial weights, the spectrum of \Box_\varphi is discrete if and only if the weight is not decoupled, i.e. \Gamma contains at least a point (\alpha,\beta) with \alpha\neq0\neq\beta. Our methods comprise a new holomorphic uncertainty principle and linear optimization arguments.
