The analogue of the Riesz-Dunford functional calculus has been introduced and studied recently as well as the theory of semigroups and groups of linear quaternionic operators. In this paper we suppose that T is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous group of operators (\mathcal{Z}_T(t))_{t \in \mathbb{R}} and we show how we can define bounded operators f(T), where f belongs to a class of functions which is larger than the class of slice regular functions, using the quaternionic Laplace-Stieltjes transform. This class will include functions that are slice regular on the S-spectrum of T but not necessarily at infinity. Moreover, we establish the relation of f(T) with the quaternionic functional calculus and we study the problem of finding the inverse of f(T).
