A positive semi-definite (PSD) tensor which is not a sum-of-squares (SOS) tensor is called a PSD non-SOS (PNS) tensor. Is there a fourth order four dimensional PNS Hankel tensor? Until now, this question is still an open problem. Its answer has both theoretical and practical meanings. We assume that the generating vector v of the Hankel tensor A is symmetric. Under this assumption, we may fix the fifth element v_4 of v at 1. We show that there are two surfaces M_0 and N_0 with the elements v_2, v_6, v_1, v_3, v_5 of v as variables, such that M_0 \ge N_0, A is SOS if and only if v_0 \ge M_0, and A is PSD if and only if v_0 \ge N_0, where v_0 is the first element of v. If M_0 = N_0 for a point P = (v_2, v_6, v_1, v_3, v_5)^\top, then there are no fourth order four dimensional PNS Hankel tensors with symmetric generating vectors for such v_2, v_6, v_1, v_3, v_5. Then, we call such a point P PNS-free. We show that a 45-degree planar closed convex cone, a segment, a ray and an additional point are PNS-free. Numerical tests check various grid points, and find that they are also PNS-free.
