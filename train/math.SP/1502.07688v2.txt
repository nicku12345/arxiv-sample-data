We consider functions on a graph G whose evolution in time -\infty<t<\infty is governed by a Schr\"{o}dinger type equation with a combinatorial Laplace operator on the right side. For a given subset S of vertices of G we compute a cut-off frequency \omega>0 such that solutions to a Cauchy problem with initial data in PW_{\omega}(G) are completely determined by their samples on S\times \{k\pi/\omega\}, where k\in \mathbf{N}. It is shown that in the case of a bipartite graph our results are sharp.
