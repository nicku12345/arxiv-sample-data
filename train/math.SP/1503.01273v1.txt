We study the l^{p_1,...,p_m} singular value problem for non-negative tensors. We prove a general Perron-Frobenius theorem for weakly irreducible and irreducible nonnegative tensors and provide a Collatz-Wielandt characterization of the maximal singular value. Additionally, we propose a higher order power method for the computation of the maximal singular vectors and show that it has an asymptotic linear convergence rate.
