This paper contributes to the analysis of the peripheral (point) spectrum of positive linear operators on Banach lattices. We show that, under appropriate growth and regularity conditions, the peripheral point spectrum of a positive operator is cyclic and that the corresponding eigenspaces fulfil a certain dimension estimate. A couple of examples demonstrates that some of our theorems are optimal. Our results on the peripheral point spectrum are then used to prove a sufficient condition for the peripheral spectrum of a positive operator to be cyclic; this generalizes theorems of Lotz and Scheffold.
