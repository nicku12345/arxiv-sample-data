We study the (generalized) semi-Weyl commutation relations  U_gAU_g^*=g(A) \quad \text{ on }\quad \Dom(A),  where A is a densely defined operator and G\ni g\mapsto U_g is a unitary representation of the subgroup G of the affine group \cG, the group of affine transformations of the real axis preserving the orientation. If A is a symmetric operator, the group G induces an action/flow on the operator unit ball of contractive transformations from \Ker (A^*-iI) to \Ker (A^*+iI). We establish several fixed point theorems for this flow. In the case of one-parameter continuous subgroups of linear transformations, self-adjoint (maximal dissipative) operators associated with the fixed points of the flow give rise to solutions of the (restricted) generalized Weyl commutation relations. We show that in the dissipative setting, the restricted Weyl relations admit a variety of non-unitarily equivalent representations. In the case of deficiency indices (1,1), our general results can be strengthened to the level of an alternative.
