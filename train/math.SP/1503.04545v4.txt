We study partitions of the rectangular two-dimensional flat torus of length 1 and width b into k domains, with b a parameter in (0, 1] and k an integer. We look for partitions which minimize the energy, definedas the largest first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian on the domains of the partition. We are inparticular interested in the way these minimal partitions change when b is varied. We present herean improvement, when k is odd, of the results on transition values of b established by B. Helffer andT. Hoffmann-Ostenhof (2014) and state a conjecture on those transition values. We establishan improved upper bound of the minimal energy by explicitly constructing hexagonal tilings of thetorus. These tilings are close to the partitions obtained from a systematic numerical study based on an optimization algorithm adapted from B. Bourdin, D. Bucur, and {\'E}. Oudet (2009). These numerical results also support our conjecture concerning the transition values and give betterestimates near those transition values.
