For a particular family of long-range potentials V, we prove that the eigenvalues of the indefinite Sturm--Liouville operator A = \mathrm{sign}(x)(-\Delta + V(x)) accumulate to zero asymptotically along specific curves in the complex plane. Additionally, we relate the asymptotics of complex eigenvalues to the two-term asymptotics of the eigenvalues of associated self-adjoint operators.
