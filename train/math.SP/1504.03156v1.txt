In this paper, we consider the streaming memory-limited matrix completion problem when the observed entries are noisy versions of a small random fraction of the original entries. We are interested in scenarios where the matrix size is very large so the matrix is very hard to store and manipulate. Here, columns of the observed matrix are presented sequentially and the goal is to complete the missing entries after one pass on the data with limited memory space and limited computational complexity. We propose a streaming algorithm which produces an estimate of the original matrix with a vanishing mean square error, uses memory space scaling linearly with the ambient dimension of the matrix, i.e. the memory required to store the output alone, and spends computations as much as the number of non-zero entries of the input matrix.
