In this note, we discuss a question posed by T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof concerning the parity of the number of nodal domains for a non-constant eigenfunction of the Laplacian on flat tori. We present two results. We first show that on the torus (\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z})^{2}, a non-constant eigenfunction has an even number of nodal domains. We then consider the torus (\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z})\times(\mathbb{R}/2\rho\pi\mathbb{Z})\,, with \rho=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\,, and construct on it an eigenfunction with three nodal domains.
