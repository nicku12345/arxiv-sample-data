Let M be a Riemannian manifold, \tau: G \times M \to M an isometric action on M of an n-torus G and V: M \to \mathbb R a bounded G-invariant smooth function. By G-invariance the Schr\"odinger operator, P=-\hbar^2 \Delta_M+V, restricts to a self-adjoint operator on L^2(M)_{\alpha/\hbar}, \alpha being a weight of G and 1/\hbar a large positive integer. Let [c_\alpha, \infty) be the asymptotic support of the spectrum of this operator. We will show that c_\alpha extend to a function, W: \mathfrak g^* \to \mathbb R and that, modulo assumptions on \tau and V one can recover V from W, i.e. prove that V is spectrally determined. The main ingredient in the proof of this result is the existence of a "generalized Legendre transform" mapping the graph of dW onto the graph of dV.
