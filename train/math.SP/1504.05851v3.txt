We provide a refinement of the Poincar\'{e} inequality on the torus \mathbb{T}^d: there exists a Lebesgue-null set \mathcal{B} \subset \mathbb{T}^d of directions such that for every \alpha \in \mathcal{B} there is a c_{\alpha} > 0 with  \|\nabla f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{T}^d)}^{d-1} \| \left\langle \nabla f, \alpha \right\rangle\|_{L^2(\mathbb{T}^d)} \geq c_{\alpha}\|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{T}^d)}^{d} \qquad\mbox{for all}~f\in H^1(\mathbb{T}^d)~\mbox{with mean 0.} The derivative \left\langle \nabla f, \alpha \right\rangle does not detect any oscillation in directions orthogonal to \alpha, however, for certain \alpha the geodesic flow in direction \alpha is sufficiently ergodic to compensate for that defect. On the two-dimensional torus \mathbb{T}^2 the inequality holds for \alpha = (1, \sqrt{2}) but fails for \alpha = (1,e). Similar results should hold at a great level of generality on very general domains.
