Let l_{n} be the length of the n-th instability interval of the Hill operator Ly=-y^{\prime\prime}+q(x)y. We obtain that if l_{n}=o(n^{-2}) then c_{n}=o(n^{-2}), where c_{n} are the Fourier coefficients of q. Using this inverse result, we prove: Let l_{n}=o(n^{-2}). If \{(n\pi)^{2}: \textrm{n even and n>n_{0}}\} is a subset of the periodic spectrum of Hill operator then q=0 a.e., where n_{0} is a positive large number such that l_{n}<\varepsilon n^{-2} for all n>n_{0}(\varepsilon) with some \varepsilon>0. A similar result holds for the anti-periodic case.
