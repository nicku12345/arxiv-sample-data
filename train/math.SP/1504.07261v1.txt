For self-adjoint operators A, B, a bounded operator J, and a function f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb C we obtain bounds in quasi-normed ideals of compact operators for the difference f(A)J-Jf(B) in terms of the operator AJ-JB. The focus is on functions f that are smooth everywhere except for finitely many points. A typical example is the function f(t) = |t|^\gamma with \gamma \in (0, 1). The obtained results are applied to derive a two-term quasi-classical asymptotic formula for the trace tr f(S) with S being a Wiener-Hopf operator with a discontinuous symbol.
