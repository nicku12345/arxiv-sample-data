The aim of this paper is the study of q^{-1}-Fibonacci polynomials with 0<q<1. First, the q^{-1}-Fibonacci polynomials are related to a q-exponential function which allows an asymptotic analysis to be worked out. Second, related basic orthogonal polynomials are investigated with the emphasis on their orthogonality properties. In particular, a compact formula for the reproducing kernel is obtained that allows to describe all the N-extremal measures of orthogonality in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and their zeros. Two special cases involving q-sine and q-cosine are discussed in more detail.
