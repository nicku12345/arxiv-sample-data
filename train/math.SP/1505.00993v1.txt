Finding the sparsest solutions to a tensor complementarity problem is generally NP-hard due to the nonconvexity and noncontinuity of the involved \ell_0 norm. In this paper, a special type of tensor complementarity problems with Z-tensors has been considered. Under some mild conditions, we show that to pursuit the sparsest solutions is equivalent to solving polynomial programming with a linear objective function. The involved conditions guarantee the desired exact relaxation and also allow to achieve a global optimal solution to the relaxed nonconvex polynomial programming problem. Particularly, in comparison to existing exact relaxation conditions, such as RIP-type ones, our proposed conditions are easy to verify.
