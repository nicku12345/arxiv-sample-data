The Laplace-Beltrami operator on cusp manifolds has continuous spectrum. The resonances are complex numbers that replace the discrete spectrum of the compact case. They are the poles of a meromorphic function \varphi(s), s\in \mathbb{C}, the \emph{scattering determinant}. We construct a semi-classical parametrix for this function in a half plane of \mathbb{C} when the curvature of the manifold is negative. We deduce that for manifolds with one cusp, there is a zone without resonances at high frequency. This is true more generally for manifolds with several cusps and generic metrics.   We also study some exceptional examples with almost explicit sequences of resonances away from the spectrum.
