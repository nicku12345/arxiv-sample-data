In this paper, the geometry properties of Hankel form are studied, including their positive semi-definite (PSD) cone and sum-of-squares (SOS) cone. We denote them by HPSD(m,n) and HSOS(m,n), respectively. We show that both HPSD(m,n) and HSOS(m,n) are closed convex cones. The dual cone of HPSD(m,n) is the convex hull of all m-times convolutions of real vectors. Besides, we derive the dual cone of SOS tensors. By reformulation, it follows that the dual cone of HSOS(m,n) can also be written explicitly. These results may lead further research on the Hilbert-Hankel problem.
