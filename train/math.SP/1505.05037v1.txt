We will discuss the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues of Schr\"{o}dinger operator with a matrix potential defined by Neumann boundary condition in L_2^m(F), where F is d-dimensional rectangle and the potential is a m \times m matrix with m\geq 2, d\geq 2 , when the eigenvalues belong to the resonance domain, roughly speaking they lie near planes of diffraction.   \textbf{Keywords:} Schr\"{o}dinger operator, Neumann condition, Resonance eigenvalue, Perturbation theory.   \textbf{AMS Subject Classifications:} 47F05, 35P15
