We study the \epsilon-pseudospectra \sigma_\epsilon(A) of square matrices A \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times N}. We give a complete characterization of the \epsilon-pseudospectrum of any 2 \times 2 matrix and describe the asymptotic behavior (as \epsilon \to 0) of \sigma_\epsilon(A) for any square matrix A. We also present explicit upper and lower bounds for the \epsilon-pseudospectra of bidiagonal matrices, as well as for finite rank operators.
