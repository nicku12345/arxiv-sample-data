A three-parameter family B=B(a,b,c) of weighted Hankel matrices is introduced with the entries \[ B_{j,k}=\frac{\Gamma(j+k+a)}{\Gamma(j+k+b+c)}\,\sqrt{\frac{\Gamma(j+b)\Gamma(j+c)\Gamma(k+b)\Gamma(k+c)}{\Gamma(j+a)\, j!\,\Gamma(k+a)\, k!}}\,, \] j,k\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}, supposing a, b, c are positive and a<b+c, b<a+c, c\leq a+b. The famous Hilbert matrix is included as a particular case. The direct sum B(a,b,c)\oplus B(a+1,b+1,c) is shown to commute with a discrete analog of the dilatation operator. It follows that there exists a three-parameter family of real symmetric Jacobi matrices, T(a,b,c), commuting with B(a,b,c). The orthogonal polynomials associated with T(a,b,c) turn out to be the continuous dual Hahn polynomials. Consequently, a unitary mapping U diagonalizing T(a,b,c) can be constructed explicitly. At the same time, U diagonalizes B(a,b,c) and the spectrum of this matrix operator is shown to be purely absolutely continuous and filling the interval [0,M(a,b,c)] where M(a,b,c) is known explicitly. If the assumption c\leq a+b is relaxed while the remaining inequalities on a, b, c are all supposed to be valid, the spectrum contains also a finite discrete part lying above the threshold M(a,b,c). Again, all eigenvalues and eigenvectors are described explicitly.
