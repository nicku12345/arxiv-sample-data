We study resonance for the Helmholz equation with a finite frequency in a plasmonic material of negative dielectric constant in two and three dimensions. We show that the quasi-static approximation is valid for diametrically small inclusions. In fact, we quantitatively prove that if the diameter of a inclusion is small compared to the loss parameter, then resonance occurs exactly at eigenvalues of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator associated with the inclusion.
