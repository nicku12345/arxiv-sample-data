Given a complex, separable Hilbert space \mathcal{H}, we consider self-adjoint L^2-realizations of differential expressions \tau = - (d^2/dx^2) I_{\mathcal{H}} + V(x), on half-lines and on the real line (assuming the limit-point property of \tau at \pm \infty). Here V denotes a bounded operator-valued potential V(\cdot) \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}) such that V(\cdot) is weakly measurable, the operator norm \|V(\cdot)\|_{\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})} is locally integrable, and V(\cdot) = V(\cdot)^* a.e.   In a nutshell, a Donoghue-type m-function M_{A,\mathcal{N}_i}^{Do}(\cdot) associated with self-adjoint extensions A of a closed, symmetric operator \dot A in \mathcal{H} with deficiency spaces \mathcal{N}_z = \ker \big({\dot A}^* - z I_{\mathcal{H}}\big) and corresponding orthogonal projections P_{\mathcal{N}_z} onto \mathcal{N}_z is given by  M_{A,\mathcal{N}_i}^{Do}(z) = zI_{\mathcal{N}_i} + (z^2+1) P_{\mathcal{N}_i} (A - z I_{\mathcal{H}})^{-1} P_{\mathcal{N}_i}\big\vert_{\mathcal{N}_i} \,, \quad {\rm Im}(z)\neq 0.  For half-line and full-line Schr\"odinger operators, the role of \dot A is played by a suitably defined minimal Schr\"odinger operator which will be shown to be completely non-self-adjoint. The latter property is used to prove that the corresponding operator-valued measures in the Herglotz--Nevanlinna representations of the Donoghue-type m-functions corresponding to self-adjoint half-line and full-line Schr\"odinger operators encode the entire spectral information of the latter.
