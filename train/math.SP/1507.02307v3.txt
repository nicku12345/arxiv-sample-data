We prove uniform L^p resolvent estimates for the stationary damped wave operator. The uniform L^p resolvent estimates for the Laplace operator on a compact smooth Riemannian manifold without boundary were first established by Dos Santos Ferreira-Kenig-Salo and advanced further by Bourgain-Shao-Sogge-Yao. Here we provide an alternative proof relying on the techniques of semiclassical Strichartz estimates. This approach allows us also to handle non-self-adjoint perturbations of the Laplacian and embeds very naturally in the semiclassical spectral analysis framework.
