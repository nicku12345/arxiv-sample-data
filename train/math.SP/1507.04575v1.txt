In this article, we define new classes of tensors called double \overline{B}-tensors, quasi-double \overline{B}-tensors and establish some of their properties. Using these properties, we construct new regions viz., double \overline{B}-intervals and quasi-double \overline{B}-intervals, which contain all the H-eigenvalues of real even order symmetric tensors. We prove that the double \overline{B}-intervals is contained in the quasi-double \overline{B}-intervals and quasi-double {\overline{B}}-intervals provide supplement information on the Brauer-type eigenvalues inclusion set of tensors. These are analogous to the double \overline{B}-intervals of matrices established by J. M. Pe\~na~[On an alternative to Gerschgorin circles and ovals of Cassini, Numer. Math. 95 (2003), no. 2, 337-345.]
