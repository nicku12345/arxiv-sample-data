Let M be a closed Riemannian manifold carrying an effective and isometric action of a compact connected Lie group G. We derive a refined remainder estimate in the stationary phase approximation of certain oscillatory integrals on T^\ast M \times G with singular critical sets that were examined previously in order to determine the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of an invariant elliptic operator on M. As an immediate consequence, we deduce from this an asymptotic multiplicity formula for families of irreducible representations in L^2(M). In forthcoming papers, the improved remainder will be used to prove an equivariant semiclassical Weyl law and a corresponding equivariant quantum ergodicity theorem.
