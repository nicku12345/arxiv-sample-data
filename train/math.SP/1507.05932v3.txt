In this paper, we consider the dynamical zeta functions of Ruelle and Selberg associated with the geodesic flow of a compact hyperbolic odd dimensional manifold X. These functions are initially defined on one complex variable s in some right half-plane of \mathbb{C}. Our goal is the continue meromorphically the dynamical zeta functions to the whole complex plane, using the Selberg trace formula for arbitrary, not necessarily unitary, representations \chi of the fundamental group. First, we prove a trace formula for the integral operator D^{\sharp}_{\chi}(\sigma)e^{-t(D^{\sharp}_{\chi}(\sigma))^{2}}, induced by the twisted Dirac operator D^{\sharp}_{\chi}(\sigma) on X. Then we use these results to establish the meromorphic continuation of the dynamical zeta functions to \mathbb{C}.
