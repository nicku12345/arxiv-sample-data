We consider the dynamical zeta functions of Selberg and Ruelle associated with the geodesic flow on a compact odd-dimensional hyperbolic manifold. These dynamical zeta functions are defined for a complex variable s in some right-half plane of \mathbb{C}. In [Spi18], it was proved that they admit a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane. In this paper, we establish functional equations for them, relating their values at s with those at -s. We prove also a determinant representation of the zeta functions, using the regularized determinants of certain twisted differential operators.
