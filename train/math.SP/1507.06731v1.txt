The concepts of P- and P_0-matrices are generalized to P- and P_0-tensors of even and odd orders via homogeneous formulae. Analog to the matrix case, our P-tensor definition encompasses many important classes of tensors such as the positive definite tensors, the nonsingular M-tensors, the nonsingular H-tensors with positive diagonal entries, the strictly diagonally dominant tensors with positive diagonal entries, etc. As even-order symmetric PSD tensors are exactly even-order symmetric P_0-tensors, our definition of P_0-tensors, to some extent, can be regarded as an extension of PSD tensors for the odd-order case. Along with the basic properties of P- and P_0-tensors, the relationship among P_0-tensors and other extensions of PSD tensors are then discussed for comparison. Many structured tensors are also shown to be P- and P_0-tensors. As a theoretical application, the P-tensor complementarity problem is discussed and shown to possess a nonempty and compact solution set.
