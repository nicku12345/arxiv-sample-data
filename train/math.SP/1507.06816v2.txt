In the first part of this paper we provide a self-contained introduction to (regularized) perturbation determinants for operators in Banach spaces. In the second part, we use these determinants to derive new bounds on the discrete eigenvalues of compactly perturbed operators, broadly extending some recent results by Demuth et al. In addition, we also establish new bounds on the discrete eigenvalues of generators of C_0-semigroups.
