We estimate the ground state energy for the magnetic Laplacian with a Robin condition. In a special asymptotic limit, we find that the magnetic field does not contribute to the two-term expansion of the ground state energy, thereby proving that the Robin condition weakens diamagnetism. We discuss a semi-classical version of the operator and prove that the ground states concentrate near the boundary points of maximal curvature.
