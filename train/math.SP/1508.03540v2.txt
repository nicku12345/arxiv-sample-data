We study the spectral properties of Schr\"odinger operators on a compact connected Riemannian manifold M without boundary in case that the underlying Hamiltonian system possesses certain symmetries. More precisely, if M carries an isometric and effective action of a compact connected Lie group G, we prove a generalized equivariant version of the semiclassical Weyl law with an estimate for the remainder, using a semiclassical functional calculus for h-dependent functions and relying on recent results on singular equivariant asymptotics. These results will be used to derive an equivariant quantum ergodicity theorem in Part II of this work. When G is trivial, one recovers the classical results.
