In the power scale, the asymptotic behavior of the singular values of a compact Hankel operator is determined by the behavior of the symbol in a neighborhood of its singular support. In this paper, we discuss the localization principle which says that the contributions of disjoint parts of the singular support of the symbol to the asymptotic behavior of the singular values are independent of each other. We apply this principle to Hankel integral operators and to infinite Hankel matrices. In both cases, we describe a wide class of Hankel operators with power-like asymptotics of singular values. The leading term of this asymptotics is found explicitly.
