We study the ergodic properties of Schr\"odinger operators on a compact connected Riemannian manifold M without boundary in case that the underlying Hamiltonian system possesses certain symmetries. More precisely, let M carry an isometric and effective action of a compact connected Lie group G. Relying on an equivariant semiclassical Weyl law proved in Part I of this work, we deduce an equivariant quantum ergodicity theorem under the assumption that the symmetry-reduced Hamiltonian flow on the principal stratum of the singular symplectic reduction of M is ergodic. In particular, we obtain an equivariant version of the Shnirelman-Zelditch-Colin-de-Verdi\`ere theorem, as well as a representation theoretic equidistribution theorem. If M/G is an orbifold, similar results were recently obtained by Kordyukov. When G is trivial, one recovers the classical results.
