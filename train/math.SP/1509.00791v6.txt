In this paper we study the spectrum \Sigma of the infinite Feinberg-Zee random hopping matrix, a tridiagonal matrix with zeros on the main diagonal and random \pm 1's on the first sub- and super-diagonals; the study of this non-selfadjoint random matrix was initiated in Feinberg and Zee (Phys. Rev. E 59 (1999), 6433--6443). Recently Hagger (arXiv:1412.1937, Random Matrices: Theory Appl.}, {\bf 4} 1550016 (2015)) has shown that the so-called periodic part \Sigma_\pi of \Sigma, conjectured to be the whole of \Sigma and known to include the unit disk, satisfies p^{-1}(\Sigma_\pi) \subset \Sigma_\pi for an infinite class S of monic polynomials p. In this paper we make very explicit the membership of S, in particular showing that it includes P_m(\lambda) = \lambda U_{m-1}(\lambda/2), for m\geq 2, where U_n(x) is the Chebychev polynomial of the second kind of degree n. We also explore implications of these inverse polynomial mappings, for example showing that \Sigma_\pi is the closure of its interior, and contains the filled Julia sets of infinitely many p\in S, including those of P_m, this partially answering a conjecture of the second author.
