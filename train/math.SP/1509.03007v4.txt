In this article, we prove the following spectral theorem for right linear normal operators (need not to be bounded) in quaternionic Hilbert spaces: Let T be an unbounded right quaternionic linear normal operator in a quaternionic Hilbert space H with domain \mathcal{D}(T), a right linear subspace of H and fix a unit imaginary quaternion, say m. Then there exists a Hilbert basis \mathcal{N} of H and a unique quaternionic spectral measure F on the \sigma- algebra of \mathbb C_m^{+} (upper half plane of the slice complex plane \mathbb C_m) associated to T such that \begin{equation*}   \left\langle x | Ty \right\rangle = \int\limits_{\sigma_{S}(T) \cap \mathbb{C}_{m}^{+}}\lambda \ dF_{x,y}(\lambda),\; \text{ for all}\; y \in \mathcal{D}(T),\ x \in H, \end{equation*} where F_{x,y} is a quaternion valued measure on the \sigma- algebra of \mathbb{C}_{m}^{+}, for any x,y\in H and \sigma_{S}(T) is the spherical spectrum of T. Here the representation of T is established with respect to the Hilbert basis \mathcal{N}.   To prove this result, we reduce the problem to the complex case and obtain the result by using the classical result.
