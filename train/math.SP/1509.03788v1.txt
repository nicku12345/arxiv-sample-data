The present paper addresses questions on resonances for a 1D Schr\"{o}dinger operator with truncated periodic potential. Precisely, we consider the half-line operator H^{\mathbb N}=-\Delta +V and H^{\mathbb N}_L = -\Delta + V 1_{[0,L]} acting on \ell^{2}(\mathbb N) with Dirichlet boundary condition at 0 with L \in \mathbb N. We describe the resonances of H^{\mathbb N}_{L} near the boundary of the essential spectrum of H^{\mathbb N} as L \rightarrow +\infty in the generic case.
