The eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian of a graph provide information on its topological and structural characteristics and also on some relevant dynamical aspects, specifically in relation to random walks. In this paper we determine the spectra of the normalized Laplacian of iterated triangulations of a generic simple connected graph. As an application, we also find closed-forms for their multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff index, Kemeny's constant and number of spanning trees.
