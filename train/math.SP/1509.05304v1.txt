Given a bounded open set \Omega in  \mathbb R^n (or in a Riemannian manifold) and a partition of \Omega by k open sets D_j, we consider the quantity \max_j \lambda(D_j) where \lambda(D_j) is the ground state energy of the Dirichlet realization of the Laplacian in D_j. If we denote by  \mathfrak L_k(\Omega) the infimum over all the k-partitions of  \max_j \lambda(D_j), a minimal k-partition is then a partition which realizes the infimum. When k=2, we find the two nodal domains of a second eigenfunction, but the analysis of higher k's is non trivial and quite interesting. In this paper, we give the proof of one conjecture formulated previously by V. Bonnaillie-Noel and B. Helffer about a magnetic characterization of the minimal partitions when n=2.
