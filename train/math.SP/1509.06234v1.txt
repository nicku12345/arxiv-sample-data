We consider a pencil of matrix Sturm-Liouville operators on a finite interval. We study properties of its spectral characteristics and inverse problems that consist in recovering of the pencil by the spectral data: eigenvalues and so--called weight matrices. This inverse problem is reduced to a linear equation in a Banach space by the method of spectral mappings. Constructive algorithm for the solution of the inverse problem is provided.
