Let \mu be a probability measure with an infinite compact support on \mathbb{R}. Let us further assume that (F_n)_{n=1}^\infty is a sequence of orthogonal polynomials for \mu where (f_n)_{n=1}^\infty is a sequence of nonlinear polynomials and F_n:=f_n\circ\dots\circ f_1 for all n\in\mathbb{N}. We prove that if there is an s_0\in\mathbb{N} such that 0 is a root of f_n^\prime for each n>s_0 then the distance between any two zeros of an orthogonal polynomial for \mu of a given degree greater than 1 has a lower bound in terms of the distance between the set of critical points and the set of zeros of some F_k. Using this, we find sharp bounds from below and above for the infimum of distances between the consecutive zeros of orthogonal polynomials for singular continuous measures.
