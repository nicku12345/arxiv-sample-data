We consider a class of tridiagonal operators induced by not necessary pseudoergodic biinfinite sequences. Using only elementary techniques we prove that the numerical range of such operators is contained in the convex hull of the union of the numerical ranges of the operators corresponding to the constant biinfinite sequences; whilst the other inclusion is shown to hold when the constant sequences belong to the subshift generated by the given biinfinite sequence. Applying recent results by S. N. Chandler-Wilde et al. and R. Hagger, which rely on limit operator techniques, we are able to provide more general results although the closure of the numerical range needs to be taken.
