In this paper we discuss the problem of decomposition for unbounded 2\times 2 operator matrices by a pair of complementary invariant graph subspaces. Under mild additional assumptions, we show that such a pair of subspaces decomposes the operator matrix if and only if its domain is invariant for the angular operators associated with the graphs. As a byproduct of our considerations, we suggest a new block diagonalization procedure that resolves related domain issues. In the case when only a single invariant graph subspace is available, we obtain block triangular representations for the operator matrices.
