Let X be a symmetric, pure jump, unimodal Levy process in \mathbb{R} with an infinite Levy measure. We prove that for any fixed t > 0 the survival probability P^x(\tau_{(-a,a)} > t) is nondecreasing on (-a,0], nonincreasing on [0,a) and concave on (-a/2,a/2), where a > 0 and \tau_{(-a,a)} is the first exit time of the process X from (-a,a). We also show a similar statement for sets (-a,a) \times F \subset \mathbb{R}^d.
