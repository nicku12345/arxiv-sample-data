We give a short review of results on inverse spectral problems for ordinary differential operators on a spatial networks (geometrical graphs). We pay the main attention to the most important nonlinear inverse problems of recovering coefficients of differential equations from spectral characteristics provided that the structure of the graph is known a priori. In the first half of the review we provide results related to inverse Sturm-Liouville problems on arbitrary compact graphs. Further, results on inverse problems for arbitrary order differential operators on compact graphs are presented. At the end we provide the main results on inverse problems on noncompact graphs.
