Let A be a self-adjoint operator in a separable Hilbert space. Suppose that the spectrum of A is formed of two isolated components \sigma_0 and \sigma_1 such that the set \sigma_0 lies in a finite gap of the set \sigma_1. Assume that V is a bounded additive self-adjoint perturbation of A, off-diagonal with respect to the partition {\rm spec}(A)=\sigma_0 \cup \sigma_1. It is known that if \|V\|<\sqrt{2}{\rm dist}(\sigma_0,\sigma_1), then the spectrum of the perturbed operator L=A+V consists of two disjoint parts \omega_0 and \omega_1 which originate from the corresponding initial spectral subsets \sigma_0 and \sigma_1. Moreover, for the difference of the spectral projections E_A(\sigma_0) and E_{L}(\omega_0) of A and L associated with the spectral sets \sigma_0 and \omega_0, respectively, the following sharp norm bound holds: \|E_A(\sigma_0)-E_{L}(\omega_0)\|\leq\sin\left(\arctan\frac{\|V\|}{{\rm dist}(\sigma_0,\sigma_1)}\right). In the present note, we give a new proof of this bound for \|V\|<{\rm dist}(\sigma_0,\sigma_1).
