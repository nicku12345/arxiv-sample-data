In a recent paper, we exhibit a link between the average local growth of Laplace eigenfunctions on surfaces and the size of their nodal set. In that paper, the average local growth is computed using the uniform - or L^\infty - growth exponents on disks of wavelength radius. The purpose of this note is to prove similar results for a broader class of L^q growth exponents with q \in (1, \infty). More precisely, we show that the size of the nodal set is bounded above and below by the product of the average local L^q growth with the frequency. We briefly discuss the relation between this new result and Yau's conjecture on the size of nodal sets.
