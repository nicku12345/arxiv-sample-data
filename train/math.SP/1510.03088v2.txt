We show that spectral problems for periodic operators on lattices with embedded defects of lower dimensions can be solved with the help of matrix-valued integral continued fractions. While these continued fractions are usual in the approximation theory, they are less known in the context of spectral problems. We show that the spectral points can be expressed as zeroes of determinants of the continued fractions. They are also useful in the study of inverse problems (one-to-one correspondence between spectral data and defects). Finally, the explicit formula for the resolvent in terms of the continued fractions is also provided. We apply some of our results to the Schr\"odinger operator acting on the graphene with line and point defects.
