We prove that the number of nodal domains of a density one subsequence of eigenfunctions grows at least logarithmically with the eigenvalue on negatively curved `real Riemann surfaces'. The geometric model is the same as in prior joint work with Junehyuk Jung (arXiv:1310.2919, to appear in J. Diff. Geom), where the number of nodal domains was shown to tend to infinity, but without a specified rate. The proof of the logarithmic rate uses the new logarithmic scale quantum ergodicity results of Hezari-Riviere (arXiv:1411.4078) and X. Han (arXiv:1410.3911).
