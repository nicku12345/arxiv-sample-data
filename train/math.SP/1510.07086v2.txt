We introduce a notion of \beta-almost periodicity and prove quantitative lower spectral/quantum dynamical bounds for general bounded \beta-almost periodic potentials. Applications include a sharp arithmetic criterion of full spectral dimensionality for analytic quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators in the positive Lyapunov exponent regime and arithmetic criteria for families with zero Lyapunov exponents, with applications to Sturmian potentials and the critical almost Mathieu operator.
