We study the asymptotic complexity constant of the sequence of approximating graphs to a fully symmetric self-similar structure on a finitely ramified fractal K. We show how full symmetry implies existence of the asymptotic complexity constant and obtain a sharp lower bound thereby answering two conjectures by Anema.
