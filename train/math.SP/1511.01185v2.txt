The search for optimal configurations of pointsets, the most notable examples being the problems of Kepler and Thompson, have an extremely rich history with diverse applications in physics, chemistry, communication theory, and scientific computing. In this paper, we introduce and study a new optimality criteria for pointset configurations. Namely, we consider a certain weighted graph associated with a pointset configuration and seek configurations which minimize certain spectral properties of the adjacency matrix or graph Laplacian defined on this graph, subject to geometric constraints on the pointset configuration. This problem can be motivated by solar cell design and swarming models, and we consider several spectral functions with interesting interpretations such as spectral radius, algebraic connectivity, effective resistance, and condition number. We prove that the regular simplex extremizes several spectral invariants on the sphere. We also consider pointset configurations on flat tori via (i) the analogous problem on lattices and (ii) through a variety of computational experiments. For many of the objectives considered (but not all), the triangular lattice is extremal.
