We study the analytic torsion of odd-dimensional hyperbolic orbifolds \Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}^{2n+1}, depending on a representation of \Gamma. Our main goal is to understand the asymptotic behavior of the analytic torsion with respect to sequences of representations associated to rays of highest weights.
