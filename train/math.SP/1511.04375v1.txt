In this article, we study the zeta function \zeta_q associated to the Laplace operator \Delta_q acting on the space of the smooth (0,q)-forms with q=0,\ldots,n on the complex projective space \mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{C}) endowed with its Fubini-Study metric. In particular, we show that the values of \zeta_q at non-positive integers are rational. Moreover, we give a formula for  \sum_{q\geq 0}(-1)^{q+1}q\zeta_q'(0), the associated holomorphic analytic torsion.
