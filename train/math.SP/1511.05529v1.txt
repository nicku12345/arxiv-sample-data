In the present article we will give a new proof of the ground state asymptotics of the Dirichlet Laplacian with a Neumann window acting on functions which are defined on a two-dimensional infinite strip or a three-dimensional infinite layer. The proof is based on the analysis of the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator as a first order classical pseudo-differential operator. Using the explicit representation of its symbol we prove an asymptotic expansion as the window length decreases.
