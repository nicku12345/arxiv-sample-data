We compute the limiting statistical distribution of the eigenvalues of sequences of matrices whose entries satisfy what we call a vanishing mean variation condition and are \mu-distributed for some probability measure. As an application of our results, we extend the well-known class of Kac-Murdock-Szeg\H{o} generalized Toeplitz matrices to sequences of matrices whose diagonal entries are modeled by Riemann integrable functions.
