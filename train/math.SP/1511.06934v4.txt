We obtain asymptotic representations as \lambda \to \infty in the upper and lower half-planes for the solutions of the Sturm--Liouville equation  -y"+p(x)y'+q(x)y= \lambda ^2 \rho(x)y, \qquad x\in [a,b] \subset \mathbb{R},  under the condition that q is a distribution of the first-order singularity, \rho is a positive absolutely continuous function, and p belongs to the space L_2[a,b].   In supplementary part, the results are generilized on equation of the following type -(r^2y')'+py'+qy=\lambda ^2 \rho^2 y, \qquad x\in [a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}, where \lambda^2 is the large parameter, r and \rho are positive functions, while p and q are complex valued ones. It is assumed that p\in L_1[a,b],\quad q\in W_2^{-1}[a,b], \quad \rho ,r \in AC[a,b] =W_1^1[a,b], moreover, \begin{equation*} \rho'u, r'u, pu \in L_1[a,b], \quad \text{where }\, u=\int q \, dx, \end{equation*} and the antiderivative is understood in the sense of distributions.
