For a bounded corner domain \Omega, we consider the Robin Laplacian in \Omega with large Robin parameter. Exploiting multiscale analysis and a recursive procedure, we have a precise description of the mechanism giving the ground state of the spectrum. It allows also the study of the bottom of the essential spectrum on the associated tangent structures given by cones. Then we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenvalue for this singular limit in any dimension, with remainder estimates. The same method works for the Schr\"odinger operator in \mathbb{R}^n with a strong attractive delta-interaction supported on \partial\Omega. Applications to some Erhling's type estimates and the analysis of the critical temperature of some superconductors are also provided.
