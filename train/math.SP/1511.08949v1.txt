Let R_+: = [ 0 , +\infty) . Assume that  n \times n ( n \in \mathcal{N} ) matrix functions P, Q  and  R  are defined on the set R_+ , P(x) is non-degenerate, P(x) and Q(x) are Hermitian matrices when x \in R_+ and the elements of the matrix functions P^{-1},  Q  and  R  are measurable on R_+ and integrable on each closed subinterval of this set. In this paper we study operators generated by formal expressions \begin{equation*} \label{trivial} l[f]=-(P(f^{\prime}-Rf))^{\prime}-R^*P(f^{\prime}-Rf)+Qf, \end{equation*} in the space  \mathcal {L}^2_n(R_+) and, as a special case, operators generated by expressions of the form \begin{equation*} \label{2} l[f]=-(P_0f^{\prime})^{\prime}+i((Q_0f)^{\prime}+Q_0f^{\prime})+P^{\prime}_1f, \end{equation*} where derivatives are understood in the sense of distributions and  P_0, Q_0  and  P_1  are n \times n Hermitian matrix functions with Lebesgue measurable elements, such that P^{- 1}_0  exists and \|P_0 \|, \|P^{-1 }_0 \|, \| P^{-1}_0\| \|P_1\|^2, \|P^{-1}_0\| \| Q_0\|^2 \in L^1_ {loc} (R_+) . The main aim of this paper is the study of the deficiency index of the minimal operator  L_0  generated by the expression  l[f]  in  \mathcal{L}^2_n(R_+)  in terms of matrix-valued functions P, \, Q  and  R  ( P_0, \, Q_0  and  P_1 ). The obtained results are applied to the differential operators generated by \begin{equation*} \label{p2} l[f]=-f^{\prime\prime}+ \sum\limits_{k=1}^{+\infty} {\mathcal H}_k\delta(x-x_{k})f, \end{equation*} where  x_k  ( k = 1,2, \ldots ) is an increasing sequence of positive numbers and  \lim\limits_ {k \to +\infty} x_k = +\infty ,  \mathcal{H}_k  is a n \times n numerical Hermitian matrix and  \delta(x)  is Dirac \delta  - function.
