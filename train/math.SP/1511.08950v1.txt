Let A_j,B_j (j=0,1,\ldots) be m \times m matrices, whose elements are complex numbers, A_j are selfadjoint matrices and B_j^{-1} exist. We study the deficiency index problem for minimal closed symmetric operator L with domain D_L, generated by the Jacobi matrix \textbf{J} with entries A_j,B_j in the Hilbert space l_m^2 of sequences  u=(u_0,u_1, \ldots), u_j \in C^m by mapping u \rightarrow \textbf{J}u, i.e. by the formula Lu=lu for u \in D_L, where lu=((lu)_0,(lu)_1, \ldots) and  (lu)_0:=A_0u_0+B_0u_1, \quad (lu)_j:=B^*_{j-1}u_{j-1}+A_ju_j+B_ju_{j+1}, \;\; j=1,2, \ldots  It is well known that the case of the minimal deficiency numbers of the operator L corresponds to the determinate case, and the case of the maximal deficiency numbers of this operator corresponds to the completely indeterminate case of the matrix power moment problem. In this paper we obtain new conditions of the minimal, maximal and not maximal deficiency numbers of the operator L in terms of the entries of the matrix \textbf{J}. The special attention is paid to the case m=1, i.e. we present some conditions on the elements of the numerical tridiagonal Jacobi matrix, which ensure the realization of the determinate case of the classical power moment problem.
