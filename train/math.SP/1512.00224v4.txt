We obtain results for the spectral optimisation of Neumann eigenvalues on rectangles in \mathbb{R}^2 with a measure or perimeter constraint. We show that the rectangle with measure 1 which maximises the k'th Neumann eigenvalue converges to the unit square in the Hausdorff metric as k\rightarrow \infty. Furthermore, we determine the unique maximiser of the k'th Neumann eigenvalue on a rectangle with given perimeter.
