The stated paper is dedicated to one of the inverse problems of spectral theory. It is necessary to define matrix (constant) coefficients of some quadratic pencil, if the eigenvalues of this pencil are known. Furthermore, it is known that these eigenvalues are complex valued and besides that they contain their conjugate ones. As is known, it is a problem of one company. We shall approach this problem on some restrictions.
