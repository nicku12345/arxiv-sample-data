It is well known that a potential q of the Sturm-Liouville operator Ly= -y" +q(x)y on the finite interval [0, \pi] can be uniquely recovered by the spectrum \{\lambda_k\}_1^\infty and norming constants \{\alpha_k\}_1^\infty of this operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Given potential q belonging to Sobolev space W^\theta_2[0, \pi] with \theta > -1 we associate its 2N-approximation q_N constructed by the final sets \{\lambda_k\}_1^N and \{\alpha_k\}_1^N. The main result claims that for -1\leqslant\tau <\theta the estimate \|q -q_N\|_\tau \leqslant CN^{\theta-\tau} holds, where \|\cdot\|_\tau is the norm in W^\tau_2 and the constant C depends on R but does not depend on q if \|q\|_\theta \leqslant R.
