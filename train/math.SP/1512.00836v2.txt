We give a new fractal Weyl upper bound for resonances of convex co-compact hyperbolic manifolds in terms of the dimension n of the manifold and the dimension \delta of its limit set. More precisely, we show that as R\to\infty, the number of resonances in the box [R,R+1]+i[-\beta,0] is O(R^{m(\beta,\delta)+}), where the exponent m(\beta,\delta)=\min(2\delta+2\beta+1-n,\delta) changes its behavior at \beta=(n-1-\delta)/2. In the case \delta<(n-1)/2, we also give an improved resolvent upper bound in the standard resonance free strip \{\mathrm{Im}\ \lambda\ > \delta-(n-1)/2\}. Both results use the fractal uncertainty principle point of view recently introduced in [arXiv:1504.06589]. The appendix presents numerical evidence for the Weyl upper bound.
