We consider the Lieb-Thirring inequalities on the d-dimensional torus with arbitrary periods. In the space of functions with zero average with respect to the shortest coordinate we prove the Lieb-Thirring inequalities for the \gamma-moments of the negative eigenvalues with constants independent of ratio of the periods. Applications to the attractors of the damped Navier-Stokes system are given.
