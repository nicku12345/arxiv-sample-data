We prove the existence of two-and three-particle bound states of the Schr\"odinger operators h_\mu(k),k\in \T^d and H_\mu(K),K\in \T^d associated to Hamiltonians \mathrm{h}_{\mu} and \mathrm{H}_{\mu} of a system of two and three identical bosons on the lattice \Z^d, d=1,2 interacting via pairwise zero-range attractive \mu<0 or repulsive \mu>0 potentials. As a consequence we show the existence of an isolated band in the two and three bosonic systems in an optical lattice.
