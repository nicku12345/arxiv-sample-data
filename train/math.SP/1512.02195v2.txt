For the solution u(t) to the discrete Schr\"odinger equation {\rm i}\frac{d}{dt}u_n(t)=-(u_{n+1}(t)+u_{n-1}(t))+V(\theta + n\alpha)u_n(t), \quad n\in\Z, with \alpha\in\R\setminus\Q and V\in C^\omega(\T,\R), we consider the growth rate with t of its diffusion norm \langle u(t)\rangle_{p}:=\left(\sum_{n\in\Z}(n^{p}+1) |u_n(t)|^2\right)^\frac12, and the (non-averaged) transport exponents \beta_u^{+}(p) := \limsup_{t \to \infty} \frac{2\log \langle u(t)\rangle_{p}}{p\log t}, \quad \beta_u^{-}(p):= \liminf_{t \to \infty} \frac{2\log \langle u(t)\rangle_{p}}{p\log t}. We will show that, if the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator has purely absolutely continuous spectrum, then \beta_{u}^{\pm}(p)=1, provided that u(0) is well localized.
