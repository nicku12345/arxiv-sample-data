The purpose of the paper is to present quantitative estimates for the principal eigenvalue of discrete p-Laplacian on the set of rooted trees. Alternatively, it is studying the optimal constant of a class of weighted Hardy inequality. Three kinds of variational formulas in different formulation for the mixed principal eigenvalue of p-Laplacian on the set of trees with unique root as Dirichlet boundary are presented. As their applications, we obtain a basic estimate of the eigenvalue on trees.
