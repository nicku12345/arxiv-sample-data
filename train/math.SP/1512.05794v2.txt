We give Weyl-type estimates on the natural spectral counting function for manifolds with exact hyperbolic cusps. We treat three different cases: without assumption on the compact part, assuming that periodic geodesics form a measure-zero set, and assuming the curvature is negative. In each case, we obtain the same type of remainder as in the corresponding case in the context of compact manifolds. We also investigate the counting of resonances. In particular, we extend results of Selberg to the case of non-constant, negative curvature metrics, under a genericity assumption.
