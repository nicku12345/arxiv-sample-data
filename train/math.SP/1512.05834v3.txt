It is shown that for a given infinite graph G on countably many vertices, and a compact, infinite set of real numbers \Lambda there is a real symmetric matrix A whose graph is G and its spectrum is \Lambda. Moreover, the set of limit points of \Lambda equals the essential spectrum of A, and the isolated points of \Lambda are eigenvalues of A with multiplicity one. It is also shown that any two such matrices constructed by our method are approximately unitarily equivalent.
