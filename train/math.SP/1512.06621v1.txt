In this article we prove the existence of the polar decomposition for densely defined closed right linear operators in quaternionic Hilbert spaces: If T is a densely defined closed right linear operator in a quaternionic Hilbert space H, then there exists a partial isometry U_{0} such that T = U_{0}|T|. In fact U_{0} is unique if N(U_{0}) = N(T). In particular, if H is separable and U is a partial isometry with T = U|T|, then we prove that U = U_{0} if and only if either N(T) = \{0\} or R(T)^{\bot} = \{0\}.
