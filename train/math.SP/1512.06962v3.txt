We revisit and connect several notions of algebraic multiplicities of zeros of analytic operator-valued functions and discuss the concept of the index of meromorphic operator-valued functions in complex, separable Hilbert spaces. Applications to abstract perturbation theory and associated Birman-Schwinger-type operators and to the operator-valued Weyl-Titchmarsh functions associated to closed extensions of dual pairs of closed operators are provided.
