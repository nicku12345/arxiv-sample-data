Let X be a manifold equipped with a complete Riemannian metric of constant negative curvature and finite volume. We demonstrate the finiteness of the collection of totally geodesic immersed hypersurfaces in X that lie in the zero-level set of some Laplace eigenfunction. For surfaces, we show that the number can be bounded just in terms of the area of the surface. We also provide constructions of geodesics in hyperbolic surfaces that lie in a nodal set but that do not lie in the fixed point set of a reflection symmetry.
