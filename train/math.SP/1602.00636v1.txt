In this paper, we define and study the pseudo upper and lower semi B-Fredholm of bounded operators in a Banach space. In particular, we prove equality up to S(T) between the left generalized Drazin spectrum and the pseudo upper semi B-Fredholm spectrum, S(T ) is the set where T fails to have the SVEP. Also, we prove that both of the left and the right generalized Drazin operators are invariant under additive commuting power finite rank perturbations and some perturbations for the pseudo upper and lower semi B-Fredholm operators are given. As applications, we investigate some classes of operators as the supercyclic and multiplier operators. Furthermore, we investigate the left and the right generalized Drazin invertibility of upper triangular operator matrices by giving sufficient conditions which assure that the left and the right generalized Drazin spectrum or the pseudo upper and lower semi B-Fredholm of an upper triangular operator matrices is the union of its diagonal entries spectra.
