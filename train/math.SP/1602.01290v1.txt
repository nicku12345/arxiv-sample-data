The one-dimensional Dirac operator with periodic potential V=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \mathcal{P}(x) \\ \mathcal{Q}(x) & 0 \end{pmatrix}, where \mathcal{P},\mathcal{Q}\in L^2([0,\pi]) subject to periodic, antiperiodic or a general strictly regular boundary condition (bc) has discrete spectrums. It is known that, for large enough |n| in the disc centered at n of radius 1/4, the operator has exactly two (periodic if n is even or antiperiodic if n is odd) eigenvalues \lambda_n^+ and \lambda_n^- (counted according to multiplicity) and one eigenvalue \mu_n^{bc} corresponding to the boundary condition (bc). We prove that the smoothness of the potential could be characterized by the decay rate of the sequence |\delta_n^{bc}|+|\gamma_n|, where \delta_n^{bc}=\mu_n^{bc}-\lambda_n^+ and \gamma_n=\lambda_n^+-\lambda_n^-. Furthermore, it is shown that the Dirac operator with periodic or antiperiodic boundary condition has the Riesz basis property if and only if \sup\limits_{\gamma_n\neq0} \frac{|\delta_n^{bc}|}{|\gamma_n|} is finite.
