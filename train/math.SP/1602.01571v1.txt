We consider the hamiltonian \mathrm{H}_{\mu},\mu\in \R of a system of three-particles (two identical fermions and one different particle) moving on the lattice {\Z}^d ,\, d=1,2  interacting through repulsive (\mu>0) or attractive (\mu<0) zero-range pairwise potential \mu V. We prove for any \mu\ne0 the existence of bound state of the discrete three-particle Schr\"odinger operator H_{\mu}(K),\,K\in \T^d being the three-particle quasi-momentum, associated to the hamiltonian \mathrm{H}_{\mu}.
