In this work, we study the spectral statistics for Anderson model on \ell^2(\mathbb{N}) with decaying randomness whose single site distribution has unbounded support. Here we consider the operator H^\omega given by (H^\omega u)_n=u_{n+1}+u_{n-1}+a_n\omega_n u_n, a_n\sim n^{-\alpha} and \{\omega_n\} are real i.i.d random variables following symmetric distribution \mu with fat tail, i.e \mu((-R,R)^c)<\frac{C}{R^\delta} for R\gg 1, for some constant C. In case of \alpha-\frac{1}{\delta}>\frac{1}{2}, we are able to show that the eigenvalue process in (-2,2) is the clock process.
