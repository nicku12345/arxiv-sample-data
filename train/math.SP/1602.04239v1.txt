Inverse spectral problems for Sturm-Liouville operators on a finite interval with non-separated boundary conditions are studied in the central symmetric case, when the potential is symmetric with respect to the middle of the interval. We discuss statements of the problems, provide algorithms for their solutions along with necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the inverse problems considered.
