In this article, associated with each lattice T\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^n the concept of a harmonic-counting measure \nu_T on a sphere S^{n-1} is introduced and it is applied to determine the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a lens space. In fact, the asymptotic behavior of the cardinality of the set of independent eigenfunctions associated with the elements of T which lie in a cone is determined when T is the lattice of a lens space.
