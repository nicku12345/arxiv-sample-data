Let H_V=-\Delta +V be a Schr\"odinger operator on an arbitrary open set \Omega of \mathbb R^d, where d \geq 3, and \Delta is the Dirichlet Laplacian and the potential V belongs to the Kato class on \Omega. The purpose of this paper is to show L^p-boundedness of an operator \varphi(H_V) for any rapidly decreasing function \varphi on \mathbb R. \varphi(H_V) is defined by the spectral theorem. As a by-product, L^p-L^q-estimates for \varphi(H_V) are also obtained.
