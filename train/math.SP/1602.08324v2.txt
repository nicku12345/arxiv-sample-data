Let (\Sigma, g) be a closed connected surface equipped with a riemannian metric. Let (\lambda n) n\inN and (\psi n) n\inN be the increasing sequence of eigenvalues and the sequence of corresponding L 2-normalized eigenfunctions of the laplacian on \Sigma. For each L \textgreater{} 0, we consider \phi L = 0\textless{}\lambdan\leL \xin \sqrt \lambdan \psi n where the \xi n are i.i.d centered gaussians with variance 1. As L \rightarrow \infty, \phi L converges a.s. to the Gaussian Free Field on \Sigma in the sense of distributions. We first compute the asymptotic behavior of the covariance function for this family of fields as L \rightarrow \infty. We then use this result to obtain the asymptotics of the probability that \phi L is positive on a given open proper subset with smooth boundary. In doing so, we also prove the concentration of the supremum of \phi L around 1 \sqrt 2\pi ln L.
