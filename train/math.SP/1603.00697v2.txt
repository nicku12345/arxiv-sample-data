Let \mathcal{H} be a right quaternionic Hilbert space and let T be a quaternionic normal operator with the domain \mathcal{D}(T) \subset \mathcal{H}. Then for a fixed unit imaginary quaternion m, there exists a Hilbert basis \mathcal{N}_{m} of \mathcal{H}, a measure space (\Omega, \mu), a unitary operator U \colon \mathcal{H} \to L^{2}(\Omega; \mathbb{H}; \mu) and a \mu - measurable function \phi \colon \Omega \to \mathbb{C}_m (here \mathbb{C}_{m} = \{\alpha + m \beta; \;\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}\}) such that \[ Tx = U^{*}M_{\phi}Ux, \; \mbox{for all}\; x\in \mathcal{D}(T), \] where M_{\phi} is the multiplication operator on L^{2}(\Omega; \mathbb{H}; \mu) induced by \phi with  U(\mathcal{D}(T)) \subseteq \mathcal{D}(M_{\phi}). In the process, we prove that every complex Hilbert space is a slice Hilbert space.   We establish these results by reducing it to the complex case then lift it to the quaternionic case.
