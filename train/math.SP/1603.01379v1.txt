We prove geometric L^p versions of Hardy's inequality for the sub-elliptic Laplacian on convex domains \Omega in the Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}^n, where convex is meant in the Euclidean sense. When p=2 and \Omega is the half-space given by \langle \xi, \nu\rangle > d this generalizes an inequality previously obtained by Luan and Yang. For such p and \Omega the inequality is sharp and takes the form \begin{equation}   \int_\Omega |\nabla_{\mathbb{H}^n}u|^2 \, d\xi \geq \frac{1}{4}\int_{\Omega} \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\langle X_i(\xi), \nu\rangle^2+\langle Y_i(\xi), \nu\rangle^2}{\textrm{dist}(\xi, \partial \Omega)^2}|u|^2\, d\xi, \end{equation} where \textrm{dist}(\, \cdot\,, \partial \Omega) denotes the Euclidean distance from \partial \Omega.
