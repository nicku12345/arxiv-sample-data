A symmetric tensor is called copositive if it generates a multivariate form taking nonnegative values over the nonnegative orthant. Copositive tensors have found important applications in polynomial optimization and tensor complementarity problems. In this paper, we consider copositivity detection of tensors both from theoretical and computational points of view. After giving several necessary conditions for copositive tensors, we propose several new criteria for copositive tensors based on the representation of the multivariate form in barycentric coordinates with respect to the standard simplex and simplicial partitions. It is verified that, as the partition gets finer and finer, the concerned conditions eventually capture all strictly copositive tensors. Based on the obtained theoretical results with the help of simplicial partitions, we propose a numerical method to judge whether a tensor is copositive or not. The preliminary numerical results confirm our theoretical findings.
