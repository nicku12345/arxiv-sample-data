In this article we consider fractional Laplacians which seem to be of interest to probability theory. This is a rather new class of operators for us but our methods works (with a twist, as usual). Our main goal is to derive a two-term asymptotics as one-term asymptotics is easily obtained by R.~Seeley's method.
