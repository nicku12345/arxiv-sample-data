In this note we prove an analogue of the Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality, that is, that the geodesic ball is a maximiser of the first eigenvalue of some convolution type integral operators, on the sphere \mathbb{S}^{n} and on the real hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^{n}. It completes the study of such question for complete, connected, simply connected Riemannian manifolds of constant sectional curvature. We also discuss an extremum problem for the second eigenvalue on \mathbb{H}^{n} and prove the Hong-Krahn-Szeg\"{o} type inequality. The main examples of the considered convolution type operators are the Riesz transforms with respect to the geodesic distance of the space.
