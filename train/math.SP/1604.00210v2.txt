For the solution q(t) to the one-dimensional continuous Schr\"odinger equation {\rm i}\partial_t{q}(x,t)=-\partial_x^2 q(x,t) + V(\omega x) q(x,t), \quad x\in{\Bbb R}, with \omega\in{\Bbb R}^d satisfying a Diophantine condition, and V a real-analytic function on {\Bbb T}^d, we consider the growth rate of the diffusion norm \|q(t)\|_{D}:=\left(\int_{\Bbb R}x^2|q(x,t)|^2dx\right)^{\frac12} for any non-zero initial condition q(0)\in H^{1}({\Bbb R}) with \|q(0)\|_D<\infty. We prove that \|q(t)\|_{D} grows {\it linearly} with t if V is sufficiently small.
