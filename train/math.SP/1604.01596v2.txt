We derive various pinching results for small Dirac eigenvalues using the classification of \text{spin}^c and spin manifolds admitting nontrivial Killing spinors. For this, we introduce a notion of convergence for \text{spin}^c manifolds which involves a general study on convergence of Riemannian manifolds with a principal \mathbb{S}^1-bundle. We also analyze the relation between the regularity of the Riemannian metric and the regularity of the curvature of the associated principal \mathbb{S}^1-bundle on \text{spin}^c manifolds with Killing spinors.
