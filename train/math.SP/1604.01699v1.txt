Let M be a compact manifold with or without boundary and H\subset M be a smooth, interior hypersurface. We study the restriction of Laplace eigenfunctions solving (-h^2\Delta_g-1)u=0 to H. In particular, we study the degeneration of u|_H as one microlocally approaches the glancing set by finding the optimal power s_0 so that (1+h^2\Delta_H)_+^{s_0}u|_H remains uniformly bounded in L^2(H) as h\to 0. Moreover, we show that this bound is saturated at every h-dependent scale near glancing using examples on the disk and sphere. We give an application of our estimates to quantum ergodic restriction theorems.
