The columns of a m\times n ACI-matrix over a field \mathbb{F} are independent affine subspaces of \mathbb{F}^m. An ACI-matrix has constant rank \rho if all its completions have rank \rho. Huang and Zhan (2011) characterized the m\times n ACI-matrices of constant rank when |\mathbb{F}|\geq \min\{m,n+1\}. We complete their result characterizing the m\times n ACI-matrices of constant rank over arbitrary fields. Quinlan and McTigue (2014) proved that every partial matrix of constant rank \rho has a \rho\times \rho submatrix of constant rank \rho if and only |\mathbb{F}|\geq \rho. We obtain an analogous result for ACI-matrices over arbitrary fields by introducing the concept of complete irreducibility.
