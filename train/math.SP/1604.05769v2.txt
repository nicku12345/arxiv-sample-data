We study L^p bounds on spectral projections for the Laplace operator on compact Riemannian manifolds, restricted to small frequency dependent neighborhoods of submanifolds. In particular, if \lambda is a frequency and the size of the neigborhood is \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{-\delta}), then new sharp estimates are established when \delta\ge 1, while for 0\le \delta\le 1/2, Sogge's estimates turn out to be optimal. In the intermediate region 1/2<\delta<1, we sometimes get sharp estimates as well. Our arguments follow closely a recent work by Burq and Zuily.
