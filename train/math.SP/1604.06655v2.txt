This article is concerned with asymptotics of equivariant Bergman kernels and partial Bergman kernels for polarized projective Kahler manifolds invariant under a Hamiltonian holomorphic S^1 action. Asymptotics of partial Bergman kernel are obtained in the allowed region \mathcal{A} resp. forbidden region \mathcal{F}, generalizing results of Shiffman-Zelditch, Shiffman-Tate-Zelditch and Pokorny-Singer for toric Kahler manifolds. The main result gives scaling asymptotics of equivariant Bergman kernels and partial Bergman kernels in the transition region around the interface \partial \mathcal{A}, generalizing recent work of Ross-Singer on partial Bergman kernels, and refining the Ross-Singer transition asymptotics to apply to equivariant Bergman kernels.
