We provide a complete spectral analysis of all self-adjoint operators acting on \ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z}) which are associated with two doubly infinite Jacobi matrices with entries given by  q^{-n+1}\delta_{m,n-1}+q^{-n}\delta_{m,n+1}  and  \delta_{m,n-1}+\alpha q^{-n}\delta_{m,n}+\delta_{m,n+1},  respectively, where q\in(0,1) and \alpha\in\mathbb{R}. As an application, we derive orthogonality relations for the Ramanujan entire function and the third Jackson q-Bessel function.
