We prove that the harmonic extension matrices for the level-k Sierpinski Gasket are invertible for every k>2. This has been previously conjectured to be true by Hino in [6] and [7] and tested numerically for k<50. We also give a necessary condition for the non-degeneracy of the harmonic structure for general finitely ramified self-similar sets based on the vertex connectivity of their first graph approximation.
