Based on the need of studying the fractional boundary value problems by using variational methods, in this paper, we introduce a fundamental theory framework of fractional Sobolev space in one dimension, study the regularity of weak solutions for a fractional boundary value problem with variational structure, give out the spectral structure of operator {_t}D_T^\alpha {_0}D_t^\alpha with Dirichlet boundary value conditions. Especially, when \alpha=1, the operator {_t}D_T^\alpha {_0}D_t^\alpha=-D^2. So, the results of this paper are the generalization of corresponding conclusions for integer differential operator to some extent.
