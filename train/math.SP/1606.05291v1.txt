We consider the Laplace operator in a planar waveguide, i.e., an infinite two-dimensional straight strip of constant width, with particular types of Robin boundary conditions. We study the essential spectrum of the corresponding Laplacian when the boundary coupling function has a limit at infinity. Furthermore, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of discrete spectrum.
