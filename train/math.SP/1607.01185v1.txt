We investigate the dynamical systems modeling conflict processes between a pair of opponents. We assume that opponents are given on a common space by distributions (probability measures) having the similar or self-similar structure. Our main result states the existence of the controlled conflict in which one of the opponents occupies almost whole conflicting space. Besides, we compare conflicting effects stipulated by the rough structural approximation under controlled redistributions of starting measures.
