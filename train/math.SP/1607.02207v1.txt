We present asymptotically sharp inequalities for the eigenvalues \mu_k of the Laplacian on a domain with Neumann boundary conditions, using the averaged variational principle introduced in \cite{HaSt14}. For the Riesz mean R_1(z) of the eigenvalues we improve the known sharp semiclassical bound in terms of the volume of the domain with a second term with the best possible expected power of z.   In addition, we obtain two-sided bounds for individual \mu_k, which are semiclassically sharp. In a final section, we remark upon the Dirichlet case with the same methods.
