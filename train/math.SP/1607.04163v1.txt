We provide a quantitative version of the isoperimetric inequality for the fundamental tone of a biharmonic Neumann problem. Such an inequality has been recently established by Chasman adapting Weinberger's argument for the corresponding second order problem. Following a scheme introduced by Brasco and Pratelli for the second order case, we prove that a similar quantitative inequality holds also for the biharmonic operator. We also prove the sharpness of both such an inequality and the corresponding one for the biharmonic Steklov problem.
