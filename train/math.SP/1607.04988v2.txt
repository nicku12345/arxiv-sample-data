We find a relation guaranteeing that Hankel operators realized in the space of sequences \ell^2 ({\Bbb Z}_{+})  and in the space of functions L^2 ({\Bbb R}_{+})  are unitarily equivalent. This allows us to obtain exhaustive spectral results for two classes of unbounded Hankel operators in the space \ell^2 ({\Bbb Z}_{+})  generalizing in different directions the classical Hilbert matrix. We also discuss a link between representations of Toeplitz operators in the spaces \ell^2 ({\Bbb Z}_{+})  and L^2 ({\Bbb R}_{+}) .
