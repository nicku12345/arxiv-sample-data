We consider the G-invariant spectrum of the Laplacian on an orbit space M/G where M is a compact Riemannian manifold and G acts by isometries. We generalize the Sunada-Pesce-Sutton technique to the G-invariant setting to produce pairs of isospectral non-isometric orbit spaces. One of these spaces is isometric to an orbifold with constant sectional curvature whereas the other admits non-orbifold singularities and therefore has unbounded sectional curvature. We therefore show that constant sectional curvature and the presence of non-orbifold singularities are inaudible to the G-invariant spectrum.
