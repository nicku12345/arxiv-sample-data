For \alpha\in(0,\pi), let U_\alpha denote the infinite planar sector of opening 2\alpha, \[ U_\alpha=\big\{ (x_1,x_2)\in\mathbb R^2: \big|\arg(x_1+ix_2) \big|<\alpha \big\}, \] and T^\gamma_\alpha be the Laplacian in L^2(U_\alpha), T^\gamma_\alpha u= -\Delta u, with the Robin boundary condition \partial_\nu u=\gamma u, where \partial_\nu stands for the outer normal derivative and \gamma>0. The essential spectrum of T^\gamma_\alpha does not depend on the angle \alpha and equals [-\gamma^2,+\infty), and the discrete spectrum is non-empty iff \alpha<\frac\pi 2. In this case we show that the discrete spectrum is always finite and that each individual eigenvalue is a continous strictly increasing function of the angle \alpha. In particular, there is just one discrete eigenvalue for \alpha \ge \frac{\pi}{6}. As \alpha approaches 0, the number of discrete eigenvalues becomes arbitrary large and is minorated by \kappa/\alpha with a suitable \kappa>0, and the nth eigenvalue E_n(T^\gamma_\alpha) of T^\gamma_\alpha behaves as \[ E_n(T^\gamma_\alpha)=-\dfrac{\gamma^2}{(2n-1)^2 \alpha^2}+O(1) \] and admits a full asymptotic expansion in powers of \alpha^2. The eigenfunctions are exponentially localized near the origin. The results are also applied to \delta-interactions on star graphs.
