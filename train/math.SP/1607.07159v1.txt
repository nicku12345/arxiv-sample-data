The principal aim of this paper is to derive an abstract form of the third Green identity associated with a proper extension T of a symmetric operator S in a Hilbert space \mathfrak H, employing the technique of quasi boundary triples for T. The general results are illustrated with couplings of Schr\"{o}dinger operators on Lipschitz domains on smooth, boundaryless Riemannian manifolds.
