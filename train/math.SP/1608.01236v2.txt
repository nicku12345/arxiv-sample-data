Let \gamma be a smooth, non-closed, simple curve whose image is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, and let D be a planar domain consisting of the points on one side of \gamma, within a suitable distance \delta of \gamma. Denote by \mu_1^{odd}(D) the smallest nontrivial Neumann eigenvalue having a corresponding eigenfunction that is odd with respect to the y-axis. If \gamma satisfies some simple geometric conditions, then \mu_1^{odd}(D) can be sharply estimated from below in terms of the length of \gamma, its curvature, and \delta. Moreover, we give explicit conditions on \delta that ensure \mu_1^{odd}(D)=\mu_1(D). Finally, we can extend our bound on \mu_1^{odd}(D) to a certain class of three-dimensional domains. In both the two- and three-dimensional settings, our domains are generically non-convex.
