A classical question in spectral geometry is, for each pair of nonnegative integers (p,n) such that p\leq 2n, if the eigenvalues of Laplacian on p-forms of a compact K\"{a}hler manifold are the same as those of \mathbb{C}P^n equipped with the Fubini-Study metric, then whether or not this K\"{a}hler manifold is holomorphically isometric to \mathbb{C}P^n. For every positive even number p, we affirmatively solve this problem in all dimensions n with at most two possible exceptions. We also clarify in this paper some gaps in previous literature concerned with this question, among which one is related to the volume estimate of Fano K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifolds.
