A version of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in operator theory is the following: for any two symmetric, positive definite matrices A,B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} and arbitrary X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}  \|AXB\| \leq \|A^2 X\|^{\frac{1}{2}} \|X B^2\|^{\frac{1}{2}}. This inequality is classical and equivalent to the celebrated Heinz-L\"owner, Heinz-Kato and Cordes inequalities. We characterize cases of equality: in particular, after factoring out the symmetry coming from multiplication with scalars  \|A^2 X\| = 1 = \|X B^2\|, the case of equality requires that A and B have a common eigenvalue \lambda_i = \mu_j. We also derive improved estimates and show that if either \lambda_i \lambda_j = \mu_k^2 or \lambda_i^2 = \mu_j \mu_k does not have a solution, i.e. if d > 0 where \begin{align*} d &= \min_{1 \leq i,j,k \leq n} \{ | \log{ \lambda_i} + \log{ \lambda_j} - 2\log{ \mu_k}|:\lambda_i, \lambda_j \in \sigma(A), \mu_k \in \sigma(B) \} &+\min_{1 \leq i,j,k \leq n}\{ | 2\log{\lambda_i} - \log{ \mu_j} - \log{\mu_k } |:\lambda_i \in \sigma(A), \mu_j, \mu_k \in \sigma(B) \}, \end{align*} then there is an improved inequality  \|AXB\| \leq (1 - c_{n,d})\|A^2 X\|^{\frac{1}{2}} \|X B^2\|^{\frac{1}{2}} for some c_{n,d} > 0 that only depends only on n and d. We obtain similar results for the McIntosh inequality and the Cordes inequality and expect the method to have many further applications.
