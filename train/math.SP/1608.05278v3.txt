In this note we explicitly compute the resonances on hyperbolic cones. These are hyperbolic manifolds with a conic singularity equipped with a warped product metric. The calculation is based on separation of variables and Kummer's connection formulae for hypergeometric functions. To our knowledge this is the one of the few explicit calculations of resonances that does not rely on the resolvent being a two-point function.
