We study the spectrum of a self-adjoint Dirac-Krein operator with potential on a compact star graph \mathcal G with a finite number n of edges. This operator is defined by a Dirac-Krein differential expression with summable matrix potentials on each edge, by self-adjoint boundary conditions at the outer vertices, and by a self-adjoint matching condition at the common central vertex of \mathcal G. Special attention is paid to Robin matching conditions with parameter \tau \in\mathbb R\cup\{\infty\}. Choosing the decoupled operator with Dirichlet condition at the central vertex as a reference operator, we derive Krein's resolvent formula, introduce corresponding Weyl-Titchmarsh functions, study the multiplicities, dependence on \tau, and interlacing properties of the eigenvalues, and prove a trace formula. Moreover, we show that, asymptotically for R\to \infty, the difference of the number of eigenvalues in the intervals [0,R) and [-R,0) deviates from some integer \kappa_0, which we call dislocation index, at most by n+2.
