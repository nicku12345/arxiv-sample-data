We consider nonsymmetric rank one singular perturbations of a selfadjoint operator, i.e., an expression of the form \tilde A = A + \alpha\left\langle\cdot, \omega_1\right\rangle\omega_2, \omega_1\not = \omega_2, \alpha\in{\mathbb C}, in a general case \omega_1,\omega_2\in{\mathcal H}_{-2}. Using a constructive description of the perturbed operator \tilde A, we investigate some spectral and approximations properties of \tilde A. The wave operators corresponding to the couple A, \tilde A and a series of examples are also presented.
