In this paper we characterize the definiteness of the discrete symplectic system, study a nonhomogeneous discrete symplectic system, and introduce the minimal and maximal linear relations associated with these systems. Fundamental properties of the corresponding deficiency indices, including a relationship between the number of square summable solutions and the dimension of the defect subspace, are also derived. Moreover, a sufficient condition for the existence of a densely defined operator associated with the symplectic system is provided.
