We study unimodular transformations of conservative L-systems. Classes \sM^Q, \sM^Q_\kappa, \sM^{-1,Q}_\kappa that are impedance functions of the corresponding L-systems are introduced. A unique unimodular transformation of a given L-system with impedance function from the mentioned above classes is found such that the impedance function of a new L-system belongs to \sM^{(-Q)}, \sM^{(-Q)}_\kappa, \sM^{-1,(-Q)}_\kappa, respectively. As a result we get that considered classes (that are perturbations of the Donoghue classes of Herglotz-Nevanlinna functions with an arbitrary real constant Q) are invariant under the corresponding unimodular transformations of L-systems. We define a coupling of an L-system and a so called F-system and on its basis obtain a multiplication theorem for their transfer functions. In particular, it is shown that any unimodular transformation of a given L-system is equivalent to a coupling of this system and the corresponding controller, an F-system with a constant unimodular transfer function. In addition, we derive an explicit form of a controller responsible for a corresponding unimodular transformation of an L-system. Examples that illustrate the developed approach are presented.
