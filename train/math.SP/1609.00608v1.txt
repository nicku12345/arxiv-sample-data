In this paper the spectral properties of Dirac operators A_\eta with electrostatic \delta-shell interactions of constant strength \eta supported on compact smooth surfaces in \mathbb{R}^3 are studied. Making use of boundary triple techniques a Krein type resolvent formula and a Birman-Schwinger principle are obtained. With the help of these tools some spectral, scattering, and asymptotic properties of A_\eta are investigated. In particular, it turns out that the discrete spectrum of A_\eta inside the gap of the essential spectrum is finite, the difference of the third powers of the resolvents of A_\eta and the free Dirac operator A_0 is trace class, and in the nonrelativistic limit A_\eta converges in the norm resolvent sense to a Schr\"odinger operator with an electric \delta-potential of strength \eta.
