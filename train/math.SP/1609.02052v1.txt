We study the family of compact operators B_{\alpha} = V A_{\alpha} V, \alpha>0 in L^2(\mathbb R^d), d\ge 1, where A_{\alpha} is the pseudo-differential operator with symbol a_{\alpha}(\boldsymbol\xi) = a(\alpha\boldsymbol\xi), and both functions a and V are real-valued and decay at infinity. We assume that a and V attain their maximal values A_0>0, V_0>0, only at \boldsymbol\xi = \mathbf 0 and \mathbf x = \mathbf 0. We also assume that a(\boldsymbol\xi) = &\ A_0 - \Psi_{\gamma}(\boldsymbol\xi) + o(|\boldsymbol\xi|^{\gamma}),\ |\boldsymbol\xi|\to 0, V(\mathbf x) = &\ V_0 - \Phi_{\beta}(\mathbf x) + o(|\mathbf x|^{\beta}),\ |\mathbf x|\to 0, with some functions \Psi_{\gamma}(\boldsymbol\xi)>0, \boldsymbol\xi\not =\mathbf 0 and \Phi_{\beta}(\mathbf x) >0, \mathbf x\not = \mathbf 0 that are homogeneous of degree \gamma>0 and \beta >0 respectively. The main result is the following asymptotic formula for the eigenvalues \lambda_{\alpha}^{(n)} of the operator B_{\alpha} (arranged in descending order counting multiplicity) for fixed n and \alpha\to 0: \lambda_{\alpha}^{(n)} = A_0V_0^2 - \mu^{(n)} \alpha^{\sigma} + o(\alpha^{\sigma}), \alpha\to 0, where \sigma^{-1} = \gamma^{-1}+ \beta^{-1}, and \mu^{(n)} are the eigenvalues (arranged in ascending order counting multiplicity) of the model operator T with symbol V_0^2\Psi_{\gamma}(\boldsymbol\xi) + 2A_0 V_0 \Phi_{\beta}(\mathbf x).
