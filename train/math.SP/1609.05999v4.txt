We give a construction of a class of magnetic Laplacian operators on finite directed graphs. We study some general combinatorial and algebraic properties of operators in this class before applying the Harrell-Stubbe Averaged Variational Principle to derive several sharp bounds on sums of eigenvalues of such operators. In particular, among other inequalities, we show that if G is a directed graph on n vertices arising from orienting a connected subgraph of d-regular loopless graph on n vertices, then if \Delta_\theta is any magnetic Laplacian on G, of which the standard combinatorial Laplacian is a special case, and \lambda_0\leq \lambda_1\leq ...\leq\lambda_{n-1} are the eigenvalues of \Delta_{\theta}, then for k\leq \frac{n}{2}, we have \[\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\lambda_j \leq d-1.\]
