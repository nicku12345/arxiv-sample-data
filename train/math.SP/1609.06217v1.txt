It is shown that max-preserving maps (or join-morphisms) on the positive orthant in Euclidean n-space endowed with the component-wise partial order give rise to a semiring. This semiring admits a closure operation for maps that generate stable dynamical systems. For these monotone maps, the closure is used to define suitable notions of left and right eigenvectors that are characterized by inequalities. Some explicit examples are given and applications in the construction of Lyapunov functions are described.
