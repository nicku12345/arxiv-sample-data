We study Lam\'e operators of the form L = -\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + m(m+1)\omega^2\wp(\omega x+z_0), with m\in\mathbb{N} and \omega a half-period of \wp(z). For rectangular period lattices, we can choose \omega and z_0 such that the potential is real, periodic and regular. It is known after Ince that the spectrum of the corresponding Lam\'e operator has a band structure with not more than m gaps. In the first part of the paper, we prove that the opened gaps are precisely the first m ones. In the second part, we study the Lam\'e spectrum for a generic period lattice when the potential is complex-valued. We concentrate on the m=1 case, when the spectrum consists of two regular analytic arcs, one of which extends to infinity, and briefly discuss the m=2 case, paying particular attention to the rhombic lattices.
