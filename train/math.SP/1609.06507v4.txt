In this paper, we give Lieb-Thirring type inequalities for isolated eigenvalues of d-dimensional non-selfadjoint Schr\"{o}dinger operators with complex-valued and dilation analytic potentials. In order to derive them, we prove that isolated eigenvalues and their multiplicities are invariant under complex dilation.
