We consider the problem of geometric optimization for the lowest eigenvalue of the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with an attractive \delta-interaction supported on an open arc with two free endpoints. Under a constraint of fixed length of the arc, we prove that the maximizer is a line segment, the respective spectral isoperimetric inequality being strict. We also show that in the optimization problem for the same spectral quantity, but with the constraint of fixed endpoints, the optimizer is the line segment connecting them. As a consequence of the result for \delta-interaction, we obtain that a line segment is also the maximizer in the optimization problem for the lowest eigenvalue of the Robin Laplacian on a plane with a slit along an open arc of fixed length.
