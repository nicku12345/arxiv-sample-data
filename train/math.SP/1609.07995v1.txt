In this paper, we study B-Fredholm elements in rings and algebras. After characterising these elements in terms of generalized Fredholm elements, we will give a condition on the socle of a unital primitive Banach algebra A, under which we prove that an element of A is a B-Fredholm element of index 0 if and only if it is the sum of a Drazin invertible element of A and an element of the socle of A.
