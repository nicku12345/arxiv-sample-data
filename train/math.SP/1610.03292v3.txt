Let (X,d) be a proper ultrametric space. Given a measure m on X and a function B \mapsto C(B) defined on the collection of all non-singleton balls B of X, we consider the associated hierarchical Laplacian L=L_{C}\,. The operator L acts in \mathcal{L}^{2}(X,m), is essentially self-adjoint and has a pure point spectrum. It admits a continuous heat kernel \mathfrak{p}(t,x,y) with respect to m. We consider the case when X has a transitive group of isometries under which the operator L is invariant and study the asymptotic behaviour of the function t\mapsto \mathfrak{p}(t,x,x)=\mathfrak{p}(t). It is completely monotone, but does not vary regularly. When X=\mathbb{Q}_{p}\,, the ring of p-adic numbers, and L=\mathcal{D}^{\alpha} , the operator of \ fractional derivative of order \alpha, we show that \mathfrak{p}(t)=t^{-1/\alpha}\mathcal{A}% (\log_{p}t), where \mathcal{A}(\tau) is a continuous non-constant \alpha-periodic function. We also study asymptotic behaviour of \min\mathcal{A} and \max\mathcal{A} as the space parameter p tends to \infty. When X=S_{\infty}\,, the infinite symmetric group, and L is a hierarchical Laplacian with metric structure analogous to \mathcal{D}^{\alpha}, we show that, contrary to the previous case, the completely monotone function \mathfrak{p}(t) oscillates between two functions \psi(t) and \Psi(t) such that \psi(t)/\Psi(t)\to 0 as t \to \infty\,.
