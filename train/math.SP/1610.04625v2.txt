Let X be a two-dimensional smooth manifold with boundary S^{1} and Y=[1,\infty)\times S^{1}. We consider a family of complete surfaces arising by endowing X\cup_{S^{1}}Y with a parameter dependent Riemannian metric, such that the restriction of the metric to Y converges to the hyperbolic metric as a limit with respect to the parameter. We describe the associated spectral and scattering theory of the Laplacian for such a surface. We further show that on Y the zero S^{1}-Fourier coefficient of the generalized eigenfunction of this Laplacian, as a family with respect to the parameter, approximates in a certain sense, for large values of the spectral parameter, the zero S^{1}-Fourier coefficient of the generalized eigenfunction of the Laplacian for the case of a surface with hyperbolic cusp.
