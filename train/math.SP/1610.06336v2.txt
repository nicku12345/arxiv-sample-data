What is the optimal way to cut a convex bounded domain K in Euclidean space (\mathbb{R}^n,|\cdot|) into two halves of equal volume, so that the interface between the two halves has least surface area? A conjecture of Kannan, Lov\'asz and Simonovits asserts that, if one does not mind gaining a universal numerical factor (independent of n) in the surface area, one might as well dissect K using a hyperplane. This conjectured essential equivalence between the former non-linear isoperimetric inequality and its latter linear relaxation, has been shown over the last two decades to be of fundamental importance to the understanding of volumetric and spectral properties of convex domains. In this work, we address the conjecture for the subclass of generalized Orlicz balls \[ K = \left \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \; ; \; \sum_{i=1}^n V_i(x_i) \leq E \right \} , \] confirming its validity for certain levels E \in \mathbb{R} under a mild technical assumption on the growth of the convex functions V_i at infinity (without which we confirm the conjecture up to a \log(1+n) factor). In sharp contrast to previous approaches for tackling the KLS conjecture, we emphasize that no symmetry is required from K. This significantly enlarges the subclass of convex bodies for which the conjecture is confirmed.
