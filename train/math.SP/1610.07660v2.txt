In this survey article, we review some results and conjectures related to orthogonal polynomials on Cantor sets. The main purpose of this paper is to emphasize the role of equilibrium measures in order to have a general theory of sufficiently good measures (measures that behave similarly to measures which are in the Szeg\H{o} class and the isospectral torus in the finite gap case) supported on totally disconnected subsets of \mathbb{R}. We present some open problems a number of which can be studied numerically.
