Let G be a M\'etivier group and let N be any homogeneous norm on G. For \alpha>0 denote by w_\alpha the function e^{-N^\alpha} and consider the weighted sub-Laplacian \mathcal{L}^{w_\alpha} associated with the Dirichlet form \phi \mapsto \int_{G} |\nabla_\mathcal{H}\phi(y)|^2 w_\alpha(y)\, dy, where \nabla_\mathcal{H} is the horizontal gradient on G. Consider \mathcal{L}^{w_\alpha} with domain C_c^\infty. We prove that \mathcal{L}^{w_\alpha} is essentially self-adjoint when \alpha \geq 1. For a particular N, which is the norm appearing in \mathcal{L}'s fundamental solution when G is an H-type group, we prove that \mathcal{L}^{w_\alpha} has purely discrete spectrum if and only if \alpha>2, thus proving a conjecture of J. Inglis.
