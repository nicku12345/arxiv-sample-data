We present upper and lower bounds for Steklov eigenvalues for domains in \mathbb{R}^{N+1} with C^2 boundary compatible with the Weyl asymptotics. In particular, we obtain sharp upper bounds on Riesz-means and the trace of corresponding Steklov heat kernel. The key result is a comparison of Steklov eigenvalues and Laplacian eigenvalues on the boundary of the domain by applying Pohozaev-type identities on an appropriate tubular neigborhood of the boundary and the min-max principle. Asymptotically sharp bounds then follow from bounds for Riesz-means of Laplacian eigenvalues.
