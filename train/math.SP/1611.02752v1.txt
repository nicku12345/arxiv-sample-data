In further pursuit of the diagonalizable \emph{real nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem} (RNIEP), we study the relationship between the \emph{row cone} \mathcal{C}_r(S) and the \emph{spectracone} \mathcal{C}(S) of a Perron similarity S. In the process, a new kind of matrix, \emph{row Hadamard conic} (RHC), is defined and related to the D-RNIEP. Characterizations are given when \mathcal{C}_r(S) = \mathcal{C}(S), and explicit examples are given for all possible set-theoretic relationships between the two cones. The symmetric NIEP is the special case of the D-RNIEP in which the Perron similarity S is also orthogonal.
