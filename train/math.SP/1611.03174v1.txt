The main object of the paper is a symmetric system J y'-B(t)y=\l\D(t) y defined on an interval \cI=[a,b)  with the regular endpoint a. Let \f(\cd,\l) be a matrix solution of this system of an arbitrary dimension and let (Vf)(s)=\int\limits_\cI \f^*(t,s)\D(t)f(t)\,dt be the Fourier transform of the function f(\cd)\in L_\D^2(\cI). We define a pseudospectral function of the system as a matrix-valued distribution function \s(\cd) of the dimension n_\s such that V is a partial isometry from L_\D^2(\cI) to L^2(\s;\bC^{n_\s}) with the minimally possible kernel. Moreover, we find the minimally possible value of n_\s and parameterize all spectral and pseudospectral functions of every possible dimensions n_\s by means of a Nevanlinna boundary parameter. The obtained results develop the results by Arov and Dym; A.~Sakhnovich, L.~Sakhnovich and Roitberg; Langer and Textorius.
