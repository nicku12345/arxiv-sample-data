In this paper, we introduce the concept of an m-order n-dimensional generalized Hilbert tensor \mathcal{H}_{n}=(\mathcal{H}_{i_{1}i_{2}\cdots i_{m}}),  \mathcal{H}_{i_{1}i_{2}\cdots i_{m}}=\frac{1}{i_{1}+i_{2}+\cdots i_{m}-m+a},\ a\in \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Z}^-;\ i_{1},i_{2},\cdots,i_{m}=1,2,\cdots,n,  and show that its H-spectral radius and its Z-spectral radius are smaller than or equal to M(a)n^{m-1} and M(a)n^{\frac{m}{2}}, respectively, here M(a) is a constant only dependent on a. Moreover, both infinite and finite dimensional generalized Hilbert tensors are positive definite for a\geq1. For an m-order infinite dimensional generalized Hilbert tensor \mathcal{H}_{\infty} with a>0, we prove that \mathcal{H}_{\infty} defines a bounded and positively (m-1)-homogeneous operator from l^{1} into l^{p}\ (1<p<\infty). The upper bounds of norm of corresponding positively homogeneous operators are obtained.
