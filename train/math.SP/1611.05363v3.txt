Let (\Omega,g) be a compact, real-analytic Riemannian manifold with real-analytic boundary \partial \Omega. The harmonic extensions of the boundary Dirchlet-to-Neumann eigenfunctions are called Steklov eigenfunctions. We show that the Steklov eigenfuntions decay exponentially into the interior in terms of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann eigenvalues and give a sharp rate of decay to first order at the boundary. The proof uses the Poisson representation for the Steklov eigenfunctions combined with sharp h-microlocal concentration estimates for the boundary Dirichlet-to-Neumann eigenfunctions near the cosphere bundle S^*\partial \Omega. These estimates follow from sharp estimates on the concentration of the FBI transforms of solutions to analytic pseudodifferential equations Pu=0 near the characteristic set \{\sigma(P)=0\}.
