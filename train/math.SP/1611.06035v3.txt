In this paper, a new class of positive semi-definite tensors, the MO tensor, is introduced. It is inspired by the structure of Moler matrix, a class of test matrices. Then we focus on two special cases in the MO-tensors: Sup-MO tensor and essential MO tensor. They are proved to be positive definite tensors. Especially, the smallest H-eigenvalue of a Sup-MO tensor is positive and tends to zero as the dimension tends to infinity, and an essential MO tensor is also a completely positive tensor.
