Let \mathcal{A}(H) and \mathcal{Q}(H) be the adjacency tensor and signless Laplacian tensor of an r-uniform hypergraph H. Denote by \rho(H) and \rho(\mathcal{Q}(H)) the spectral radii of \mathcal{A}(H) and \mathcal{Q}(H), respectively. In this paper we present a lower bound on \rho(H) in terms of vertex degrees and we characterize the extremal hypergraphs attaining the bound, which solves a problem posed by Nikiforov [V. Nikiforov, Analytic methods for uniform hypergraphs, Linear Algebra Appl. 457 (2014) 455-535]. Also, we prove a lower bound on \rho(\mathcal{Q}(H)) concerning degrees and give a characterization of the extremal hypergraphs attaining the bound.
