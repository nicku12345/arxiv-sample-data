We investigate the ratio asymptotic behavior of the sequence (Q_{n})_{n=0}^{\infty} of multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with a Nikishin system of p\geq 1 measures that are compactly supported on the star-like set of p+1 rays S_{+}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}: z^{p+1}\geq 0\}. The main algebraic property of these polynomials is that they satisfy a three-term recurrence relation of the form zQ_{n}(z)=Q_{n+1}(z)+a_{n} Q_{n-p}(z) with a_{n}>0 for all n\geq p. Under a Rakhmanov-type condition on the measures generating the Nikishin system, we prove that the sequence of ratios Q_{n+1}(z)/Q_{n}(z) and the sequence a_{n} of recurrence coefficients are limit periodic with period p(p+1). Our results complement some results obtained by the first author and Mi\~{n}a-D\'{i}az in a recent paper in which algebraic properties and weak asymptotics of these polynomials were investigated. Our results also extend some results obtained by the first author in the case p=2.
