In this paper we prove that the Dirac operator A_\eta with an electrostatic \delta-shell interaction of critical strength \eta = \pm 2 supported on a C^2-smooth compact surface \Sigma is self-adjoint in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3;\mathbb{C}^4), we describe the domain explicitly in terms of traces and jump conditions in H^{-1/2}(\Sigma; \mathbb{C}^4), and we investigate the spectral properties of A_\eta. While the non-critical interaction strengths \eta \not= \pm 2 have received a lot of attention in the recent past, the critical case \eta = \pm 2 remained open. Our approach is based on abstract techniques in extension theory of symmetric operators, in particular, boundary triples and their Weyl functions.
