In this note, we exhibit a three dimensional structure that permits to guide waves. This structure is obtained by a geometrical perturbation of a 3D periodic domain that consists of a three dimensional grating of equi-spaced thin pipes oriented along three orthogonal directions. Homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are imposed on the boundary of the domain. The diameter of the section of the pipes, of order \epsilon \textgreater{} 0, is supposed to be small. We prove that, for \epsilon small enough, shrinking the section of one line of the grating by a factor of \sqrt \mu (0 \textless{} \mu \textless{} 1) creates guided modes that propagate along the perturbed line. Our result relies on the asymptotic analysis (with respect to \epsilon) of the spectrum of the Laplace-Neumann operator in this structure. Indeed, as \epsilon tends to 0, the domain tends to a periodic graph, and the spectrum of the associated limit operator can be computed explicitly.
