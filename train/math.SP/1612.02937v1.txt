We prove that the Dirichlet eigenvalues and Neumann boundary data of the corresponding eigenfunctions of the operator -\Delta + q, determine the potential q, when q \in L^{n/2}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}) and n \geq 3. We also consider the case of incomplete spectral data, in the sense that the above spectral data is unknown for some finite number of eigenvalues. In this case we prove that the potential q is uniquely determined for q \in L^p(\Omega,\mathbb{R}) with p=n/2, for n\geq4 and p>n/2, for n=3.
