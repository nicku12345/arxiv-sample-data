In the context of an infinite locally finite weighted graph, we give a necessary and sufficientcondition for semi-Fredholmness of the Gauss-Bonnet operator. This result is a discrete version of thetheorem of Gilles Carron in the continuous case [5]. In addition, using a criterion of Anghel [2], we givea sufficient condition to have an operator of Gauss-Bonnet with closed range. Finally, this work can beconsidered as an extension of the work of Colette Ann\'e and Nabila Torki-Hamza [3].
