Let \sigma_n denote the largest mode-n multilinear singular value of an I_1\times\dots \times I_N tensor \mathcal T. We prove that      \sigma_1^2+\dots+\sigma_{n-1}^2+\sigma_{n+1}^2+\dots+\sigma_{N}^2\leq (N-2)\|\mathcal T\|^2 + \sigma_n^2,\quad n=1,\dots,N, \qquad\qquad (1)    where \|\cdot\| denotes the Frobenius norm. We also show that at least for the cubic tensors the inverse problem always has a solution. Namely, for each \sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_N that satisfy (1) and the trivial inequalities \sigma_1\geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{I}}\|\mathcal T\|,\dots, \sigma_N\geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{I}}\|\mathcal T\|, there always exists an I\times \dots\times I tensor whose largest multilinear singular values are equal to \sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_N.   For N=3 we show that if the equality \sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2= \|\mathcal T\|^2 + \sigma_3^2 in (1) holds, then \mathcal T is necessarily equal to a sum of multilinear rank-(L_1,1,L_1) and multilinear rank-(1,L_2,L_2) tensors and we give a complete description of all its multilinear singular values. We establish a connection with honeycombs and eigenvalues of the sum of two Hermitian matrices. This seems to give at least a partial explanation of why results on the joint distribution of multilinear singular values are scarce.
