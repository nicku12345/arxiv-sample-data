The first terms of the small volume asymptotic expansion for the splitting of Neumann boundary condition Laplacian eigenvalues due to a grounded inclusion of size {\epsilon} are derived. An explicit formula to compute the first term from the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the unperturbed domain, the inclusion size and position is given. As a consequence, when an eigenvalue of double multiplicity splits in two distinct eigenvalues, one decays like O(1/log({\epsilon})), the other like O({\epsilon}^2).
