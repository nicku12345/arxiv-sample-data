Let \Omega be an open set in Euclidean space \R^m,\, m=2,3,..., and let v_{\Omega} denote the torsion function for \Omega. It is known that v_{\Omega} is bounded if and only if the bottom of the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian acting in \Leb^2(\Omega), denoted by \lambda(\Omega), is bounded away from 0. It is shown that the previously obtained bound \|v_{\Omega}\|_{\Leb^{\infty}(\Omega)}\lambda(\Omega)\ge 1 is sharp: for m\in\{2,3,...\}, and any \epsilon>0 we construct an open, bounded and connected set \Omega_{\epsilon}\subset \R^m such that \|v_{\Omega_{\epsilon}}\|_{\Leb^{\infty}(\Omega_{\epsilon})} \lambda(\Omega_{\epsilon})<1+\epsilon. An upper bound for v_{\Omega} is obtained for planar, convex sets in Euclidean space M=\R^2, which is sharp in the limit of elongation. For a complete, non-compact, m-dimensional Riemannian manifold M with non-negative Ricci curvature, and without boundary it is shown that v_{\Omega} is bounded if and only if the bottom of the spectrum of the Dirichlet-Laplace-Beltrami operator acting in \Leb^2(\Omega) is bounded away from 0.
