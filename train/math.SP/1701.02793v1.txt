In this paper we study the behaviour of the Neumann data of Dirichlet eigenfunctions on triangles. We prove that the L^2 norm of the (semi-classical) Neumann data on each side is equal to the length of the side divided by the area of the triangle. The novel feature of this result is that it is {\it not} an asymptotic, but an exact formula. The proof is by simple integrations by parts.
