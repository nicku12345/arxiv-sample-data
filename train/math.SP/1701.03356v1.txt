Consideration is given to the continuous-time supercritical branching random walk over a multidimensional lattice with a finite number of particle generation sources of the same intensity both with and without constraint on the variance of jumps of random walk underlying the process. Asymptotic behavior of the Green function and eigenvalue of the evolution operator of the mean number of particles under source intensity close to the critical one was established.
