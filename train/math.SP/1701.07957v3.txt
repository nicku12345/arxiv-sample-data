Let \Omega be a bounded domain in \mathbb{R}^n, n\geq 2, and V\in L^\infty(\Omega) be a potential function. Consider the following transmission eigenvalue problem for nontrivial v, w\in L^2(\Omega) and k\in\mathbb{R}_+, \[(\Delta+k^2)v= 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega,\] \[(\Delta+k^2(1+V))w= 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega,\] \[w-v \in H^2_0(\Omega), \quad \lVert v \rVert_{L^2(\Omega)}=1. \] We show that the transmission eigenfunctions v and w carry the geometric information of \mathrm{supp}(V). Indeed, it is proved that v and w vanish near a corner point on \partial \Omega in a generic situation where the corner possesses an interior angle less than \pi and the potential function V does not vanish at the corner point. This is the first quantitative result concerning the intrinsic property of transmission eigenfunctions and enriches the classical spectral theory for Dirichlet/Neumann Laplacian. We also discuss its implications to inverse scattering theory and invisibility.
