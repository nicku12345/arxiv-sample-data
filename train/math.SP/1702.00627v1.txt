We prove the theorem on the completeness of the root functions of the Schroedinger operator L=-d^2/dx^2+p(x) on the semi-axis \mathbb R_+ with a complex--valued potential p(x). It is assumed that the potential p = q \pm ir is such that the real functions q and r are subject the conditions  q(x) \geqslant c r(x), \quad r(x) \geqslant c_0+ c_1 x^\alpha, \quad \alpha >0,  where the constants c, \ c_0\in \mathbb R, c_1>0 and \arg(\pm i+c) < 2\alpha\pi/(2+\alpha). For the case of the Airy operator L_c=-d^2/dx^2+cx, c=const, this theorem imply the completeness of the system of the eigenfunctions of this operator if |\arg c|<2\pi/3. Using another technique based on the asymptotic behavior of the Airy functions we prove that the completeness theorem for the operator L_c remains valid, provided that |\arg c|<5\pi/6.
