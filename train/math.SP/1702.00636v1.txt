Using the Kato-Rosenblum theorem, we describe the absolutely continuous spectrum of a class of weighted integral Hankel operators in L^2(\mathbb R_+). These self-adjoint operators generalise the explicitly diagonalisable operator with the integral kernel s^\alpha t^\alpha(s+t)^{-1-2\alpha}, where \alpha>-1/2. Our analysis can be considered as an extension of J.Howland's 1992 paper which dealt with the unweighted case, corresponding to \alpha=0.
