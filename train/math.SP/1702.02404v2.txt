We consider the Dirichlet Pauli operator in bounded connected domains in the plane, with a semi-classical parameter. We show, in particular, that the ground state energy of this Pauli operator will be exponentially small as the semi-classical parameter tends to zero and estimate this decay rate. This extends our results, discussing the results of a recent paper by Ekholm--Kova\v{r}\'ik--Portmann, to include also non-simply connected domains.
