We introduce a notion being a k-fold Lebesgue function for measure preserving transformations, where any 2-fold Lebesgue function is just ordinary Lebesgue. We discuss how this new metrical isomorphisms invariant of dynamical systems is related to others classical notions in ergodic theory, mostly focusing on its spectral aspects. In particular, for transformations with sufficiently many multiple Lebesgue functions we treat the corresponding multiple analogs of very well-known problems of Banach and Rokhlin.
