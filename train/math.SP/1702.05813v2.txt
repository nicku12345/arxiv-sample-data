We study the Strichartz estimates for Schr\"odinger equation on a metric cone X, where the metric cone X=C(Y)=(0,\infty)_r\times Y and the cross section Y is a (n-1)-dimensional closed Riemannian manifold (Y,h). The equipped metric on X is given by g=dr^2+r^2h, and let \Delta_g be the Friedrich extension positive Laplacian on X and V=V_0 r^{-2} where V_0\in\CC^\infty(Y) is a real function such that the operator \Delta_h+V_0+(n-2)^2/4 is a strictly positive operator on L^2(Y). We establish the full range of the global-in-time Strichartz estimate without loss for the Sch\"odinger equation associated with the operator \LL_V=\Delta_g+V_0 r^{-2} including the endpoint estimate both in homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases. As an application, we study the well-posed theory and scattering theory for the Sch\"odinger equation with cubic nonlinearity on this setting.
