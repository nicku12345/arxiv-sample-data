The notion of the wave spectrum of a semi-bounded symmetric operator was introduced by one of the authors in 2013. The wave spectrum is a topological space determined by the operator in a canonical way. The definition uses a dynamical system associated with the operator: the wave spectrum is constructed from its reachable sets. In the paper we give a description of the wave spectrum of the operator L_0=-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+q which acts in the space L_2(0,\infty) and has defect indices (1,1). We construct a functional (wave) model of the operator L_0^* in which the elements of the original L_2(0,\infty) are realized as functions on the wave spectrum. It turns out to be identical to the original L_0^*. The latter is fundamental in solving inverse problems: the wave model is determined by their data, which allows for reconstruction of the original.
