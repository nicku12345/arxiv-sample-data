A famous theorem due to Weyl and von Neumann asserts that two bounded self-adjoint operators are unitarily equivalent modulo the compacts, if and only if their essential spectrum agree. The above theorem does not hold for unbounded operators. Nevertheless, there exist closed subsets M of \mathbb{R} on which the Weyl--von Neumann Theorem hold: all (not necessarily bounded) self-adjoint operators with essential spectrum M are unitarily equivalent modulo the compacts. In this paper, we determine exactly which M satisfies this property.
