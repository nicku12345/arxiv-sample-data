This work deals with the interior transmission eigenvalue problem: y'' + {k^2}\eta \left( r \right)y = 0 with boundary conditions {y\left( 0 \right) = 0 = y'\left( 1 \right)\frac{{\sin k}}{k} - y\left( 1 \right)\cos k}, where the function \eta(r) is positive. We obtain the asymptotic distribution of non-real transmission eigenvalues under the suitable assumption for the square of the index of refraction \eta(r). Moreover, we provide a uniqueness theorem for the case \int_0^1\sqrt{\eta(r)}dr>1, by using all transmission eigenvalues (including their multiplicities) along with a partial information of \eta(r) on the subinterval. The relationship between the proportion of the needed transmission eigenvalues and the length of the subinterval on the given \eta(r) is also obtained.
