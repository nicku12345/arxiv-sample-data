In this paper, we consider an interior transmission eigenvalue problem on two compact Riemannian manifolds with common smooth boundary.   We suppose that a couple of these manifolds is equipped with locally anisotropic type Riemannian metric tensors, i.e., these two tensors are not equivalent in a neighborhood of common boundary.   Here we note that we do not assume that these manifolds are diffeomorphic.   In addition, we impose some conditions of the refractive indices in a neighborhood of common boundary.   Then we prove that the set of ITEs form infinite discrete set and the existence of ITE-free region.   In order to prove our results, we employ so-called the T-coercivity method.
