In this paper we prove the optimal upper bound \frac{\lambda_{n}}{\lambda_{m}}\leq\frac{n^{2}}{m^{2}} \Big(\lambda_{n}>\lambda_{m}\geq 11\sup\limits_{x\in[0,1]}q(x)\Big) for one-dimensional Schrodinger operators with a nonnegative differentiable and single-barrier potential q(x), such that \mid q'(x) \mid\leq q^{*}, where q^{*}=\frac{2}{15}\min\{q(0) , q(1)\}. In particular, if q(x) satisfies the additional condition \sup\limits_{x\in[0,1]}q(x)\leq \frac{\pi^{2}}{11}, then \frac{\lambda_{n}}{\lambda_{m}}\leq \frac{n^{2}% }{m^{2}} for n>m\geq 1. For this result, we develop a new approach to study the monotonicity of the modified Pr\"{u}fer angle function.
