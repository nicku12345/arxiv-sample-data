In this paper, we consider an interior transmission eigenvalue (ITE) problem on some compact C^{\infty }-Riemannian manifolds with a common smooth boundary. In particular, these manifolds may have different topologies, but we impose some conditions of Riemannian metrics, indices of refraction and boundary conductivity parameters on the boundary. Then we prove the discreteness of the set of ITEs, the existence of infinitely many ITEs, and its Weyl type lower bound. For our settings, we can adopt the argument by Lakshtanov and Vainberg, considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. As an application, we derive the existence of non-scattering energies for time-harmonic acoustic equations. For the sake of simplicity, we consider the scattering theory on the Euclidean space. However, the argument is applicable for certain kinds of non-compact manifolds with ends on which we can define the scattering matrix.
