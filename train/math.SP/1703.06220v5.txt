On the basis of the explicit formulae for the action of the unitary group of exponentials corresponding to almost solvable extensions of a given closed symmetric operator with equal deficiency indices, we derive a new representation for the scattering matrix for pairs of such extensions. We use this representation to explicitly recover the coupling constants in the inverse scattering problem for a finite non-compact quantum graph with \delta-type vertex conditions.
