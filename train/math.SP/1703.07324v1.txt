For every non-autonomous system, there is the related family of Koopman operators \mathcal{K}^{(t,t_0)}, parameterized by the time pair (t,t_0). In this paper we are investigating the time dependency of the spectral properties of the Koopman operator family in the linear non-autonomous case and we propose an algorithm for computation of its spectrum from observed data only. To build this algorithm we use the concept of the fundamental matrix of linear non-autonomous systems and some specific aspects of Arnoldi-like methods. In particular, we use Arnoldi-like methods on local data stencils, we exploit the information contained in the Krylov subspace projection error, and discover limitations in the application of Arnoldi-like methods to cases with continous time dependency. We present results of this data-driven algorithm on various linear non-autonomous systems, hybrid as well as continuous in time. In all the examples comparison with exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions shows excellent performance of the proposed algorithm.
