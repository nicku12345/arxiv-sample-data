The Baran metric \delta_E is a Finsler metric on the interior of E\subset \R^n arising from Pluripotential Theory. We consider the few instances, namely E being the ball, the simplex, or the sphere, where \delta_E is known to be Riemaniann and we prove that the eigenfunctions of the associated Laplace Beltrami operator (with no boundary conditions) are the orthogonal polynomials with respect to the pluripotential equilibrium measure \mu_E of E. We conjecture that this may hold in a wider generality.   The considered differential operators have been already introduced in the framework of orthogonal polynomials and studied in connection with certain symmetry groups. In this work instead we highlight the relationships between orthogonal polynomials with respect to \mu_E and the Riemaniann structure naturally arising from Pluripotential Theory
