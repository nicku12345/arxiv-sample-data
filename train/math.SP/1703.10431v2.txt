In this work, we introduce a new difference equation which is discrete analogue of Diffusion differential equation and analyze some essential spectral properties, Diffusion difference operator is self-adjoint, eigenvalues of this problem are simple and real, eigenfunctions corresponding to distinct eigenvalues, of this problem are orthogonal. Also, some useful sum representation for the linearly independent solutions of Diffusion difference equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions has been acquired and by means of this result, asymptotic formula for eigenfunction is analyzed and these results are proved.
