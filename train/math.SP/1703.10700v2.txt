In this paper, we present a new approachment for Sturm-Liouville problem having special potentials. We acquire the representations of solutions and asymptotic formulas for solutions with regard to initial conditions. Also, a few applications are given to show the requirement of Sturm-Liouville difference equations having potential function in view of suitability to the spectral theory. The approximate numerical outcomes for the eigenfunctions are compared with each other.
