We consider the Stark operator perturbed by a compactly supported potential (of a certain class) on the real line. We prove the following results: (a) upper and lower bounds on the number of resonances in complex discs with large radii,   (b) the trace formula in terms of resonances only, (c) all resonances determine the potential uniquely.
