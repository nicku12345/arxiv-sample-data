We consider the inverse dynamical problem for the dynamical system with discrete time associated with the semi-infinite Jacobi matrix. We solve the inverse problem for such a system and answer a question on the characterization of the inverse data. As a by-product we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the measure on the real line line to be the spectral measure of semi-infinite discrete Schrodinger operator.
