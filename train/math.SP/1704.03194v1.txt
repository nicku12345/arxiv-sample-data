We investigate multiplicity and symmetry properties of higher eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the p-Laplacian under homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on certain symmetric domains \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N. By means of topological arguments, we show how symmetries of \Omega help to construct subsets of W_0^{1,p}(\Omega) with suitably high Krasnosel'ski\u{\i} genus. In particular, if \Omega is a ball B \subset \mathbb{R}^N, we obtain the following chain of inequalities:  \lambda_2(p;B) \leq \dots \leq \lambda_{N+1}(p;B) \leq \lambda_\ominus(p;B).  Here \lambda_i(p;B) are variational eigenvalues of the p-Laplacian on B, and \lambda_\ominus(p;B) is the eigenvalue which has an associated eigenfunction whose nodal set is an equatorial section of B. If \lambda_2(p;B)=\lambda_\ominus(p;B), as it holds true for p=2, the result implies that the multiplicity of the second eigenvalue is at least N. In the case N=2, we can deduce that any third eigenfunction of the p-Laplacian on a disc is nonradial. The case of other symmetric domains and the limit cases p=1, p=\infty are also considered.
