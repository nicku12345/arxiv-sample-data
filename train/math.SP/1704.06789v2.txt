We consider Jacobi matrices J whose parameters have the power asymptotics \rho_n=n^{\beta_1} \left( x_0 + \frac{x_1}{n} + {\rm O}(n^{-1-\epsilon})\right) and q_n=n^{\beta_2} \left( y_0 + \frac{y_1}{n} + {\rm O}(n^{-1-\epsilon})\right) for the off-diagonal and diagonal, respectively. We show that for \beta_1 > \beta_2, or \beta_1=\beta_2 and 2x_0 > |y_0|, the matrix J is in the limit circle case and the convergence exponent of its spectrum is 1/\beta_1. Moreover, we obtain upper and lower bounds for the upper density of the spectrum. When the parameters of the matrix J have a power asymptotic with one more term, we characterise the occurrence of the limit circle case completely (including the exceptional case \lim_{n\to \infty} |q_n|\big/ \rho_n = 2) and determine the convergence exponent in almost all cases.
