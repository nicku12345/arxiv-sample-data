We consider \mathbb{R}^3 as a homogeneous manifold for the action of the motion group given by rotations and translations. For an arbitrary \tau\in \widehat{SO(3)}, let E_\tau be the homogeneous vector bundle over \mathbb{R}^3 associated with \tau. An interesting problem consists in studying the set of bounded linear operators over the sections of E_\tau that are invariant under the action of SO(3)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^3. Such operators are in correspondence with the End(V_\tau)-valued, bi-\tau-equivariant, integrable functions on \mathbb{R}^3 and they form a commutative algebra with the convolution product. We develop the spherical analysis on that algebra, explicitly computing the \tau-spherical functions. We first present a set of generators of the algebra of SO(3)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^3-invariant differential operators on E_\tau. We also give an explicit form for the \tau-spherical Fourier transform, we deduce an inversion formula and we use it to give a characterization of End(V_\tau)-valued, bi-\tau-equivariant, functions on \mathbb{R}^3.
