For convex co-compact subgroups of SL2(Z) we consider the "congruence subgroups" for p prime. We prove a factorization formula for the Selberg zeta function in term of L-functions related to irreducible representations of the Galois group SL2(Fp) of the covering, together with a priori bounds and analytic continuation. We use this factorization property combined with an averaging technique over representations to prove a new existence result of non-trivial resonances in an effective low frequency strip.
