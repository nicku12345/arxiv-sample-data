We answer Mark Kac's famous question, "can one hear the shape of a drum?" in the positive for orbifolds that are 3-dimensional and 4-dimensional lens spaces; we thus complete the answer to this question for orbifold lens spaces in all dimensions. We also show that the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of the trace of the heat kernel are not sufficient to determine the above results.
