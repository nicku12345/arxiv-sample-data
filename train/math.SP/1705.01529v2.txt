Fix positive numbers \alpha and \beta. For the family of doubly cyclic matrices of the form diag(a_1, a_2, ... ,a_n) - diag(b_1, b_2, ... ,b_n) \Sigma_*, where \Sigma_* is a permutation matrix for the n-cycle 1 \to 2, 2 \to 3, ... ,n-1 \to n, n \to 1 [cycle notation (1, 2, ... , n-1, n)], and with fixed geometric mean \alpha for the a_k's and \beta for the b_k's, the maximum number of eigenvalues in the left half-plane is attained by diag(\alpha, \alpha, ... , \alpha) - diag(\beta, \beta, ... , \beta) \Sigma_*. This confirms a conjecture of C. Johnson, Z. Price, and I. Spitkovsky.'   Moreover, the complete range of possibilities for the number of eigenvalues in the left half-plane is demonstrated: if \alpha < \beta, then any odd number between 1 and the maximum, inclusive, is attainable, and these are the only possibiliites.
