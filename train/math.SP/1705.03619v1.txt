We establish spherical variants of the Gleason-Kahane-Zelazko and Kowalski-S{\l}odkowski theorems, and we apply them to prove that every weak-2-local isometry between two uniform algebras is a linear map. Among the consequences, we solve a couple of problems posed by O. Hatori, T. Miura, H. Oka and H. Takagi in 2007.   Another application is given in the setting of weak-2-local isometries between Lipschitz algebras by showing that given two metric spaces E and F such that the set Iso((\hbox{Lip}(E),\|.\|),(\hbox{Lip}(F),\|.\|)) is canonical, then every\hyphenation{every} weak-2-local Iso((\hbox{Lip}(E),\|.\|),(\hbox{Lip}(F),\|.\|))-map \Delta from \hbox{Lip}(E) to \hbox{Lip}(F) is a linear map, where \|.\| can indistinctly stand for \|f\|_{_L} := \max\{L(f), \|f\|_{\infty} \} or  \|f\|_{_s} := L(f) + \|f\|_{\infty}.
