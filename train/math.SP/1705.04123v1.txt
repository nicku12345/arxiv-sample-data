In this study, we define discrete fractional Sturm-Liouville (DFSL) operators within Riemann-Liouville and Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional operators with both delta and nabla operators. We show selfadjointness of the DFSL operator for the first time and prove some spectral properties, like orthogonality of distinct eigenfunctions, reality of eigenvalues, paralelly in integer and fractional order differential operator counterparts.
