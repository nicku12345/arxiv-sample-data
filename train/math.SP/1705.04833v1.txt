We analyze eigenvalues emerging from thresholds of the essential spectrum of one-dimensional Dirac operators perturbed by complex and non-symmetric potentials. In the general non-self-adjoint setting we establish the existence and asymptotics of weakly coupled eigenvalues and Lieb-Thirring inequalities. As physical applications we investigate the damped wave equation and armchair graphene nanoribbons.
