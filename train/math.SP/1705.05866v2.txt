In this note, for any two orthogonal projection P,Q on a Hilbert space, the characterization of spectrum of anticommutator PQ+QP has been obtained. As a corollary, the norm formula \parallel PQ+QP\parallel=\parallel PQ\parallel+\parallel PQ\parallel^2 has been got an alternative proof (see Sam Waltrs, Anticommutator norm formula for projection operators, arXiv:1604.00699vl [math.FA] 3 Apr 2016)
