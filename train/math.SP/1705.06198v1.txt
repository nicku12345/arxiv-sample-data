We consider the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem on a simple polytope. We use the Rellich identity to obtain an explicit formula expressing the Dirichlet eigenvalue in terms of the Neumann data on the faces of the polytope of the corresponding eigenfunction. The formula is particular simple for polytopes admitting an inscribed ball tangent to all the faces. Our result could be viewed as a generalization of similar identities for simplices recently found by Christianson [1][2].
