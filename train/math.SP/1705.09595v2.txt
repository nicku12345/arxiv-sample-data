Let (M,g) be a compact, smooth, Riemannian manifold and \{ \phi_h \} an L^2-normalized sequence of Laplace eigenfunctions with defect measure \mu. Let H be a smooth hypersurface. Our main result says that when \mu is \textit{not} concentrated conormally to H, the eigenfunction restrictions to H and the restrictions of their normal derivatives to H have integrals converging to 0 as h \to 0^+.
