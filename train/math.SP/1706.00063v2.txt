A square matrix of order n with n\geq 2 is called a \textit{permutative matrix} or permutative when all its rows (up to the first one) are permutations of precisely its first row. In this paper, the spectra of a class of permutative matrices are studied. In particular, spectral results for matrices partitioned into 2-by-2 symmetric blocks are presented and, using these results sufficient conditions on a given list to be the list of eigenvalues of a nonnegative permutative matrix are obtained and the corresponding permutative matrices are constructed. Guo perturbations on given lists are exhibited.
