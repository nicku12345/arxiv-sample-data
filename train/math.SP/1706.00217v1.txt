Spectra of functionals \Phi(u)=\frac{\left\langle u^{(n)}u^{(n)}\right\rangle}{\left\langle u^{(n-p)}u^{(n-p)}\right\rangle} in spaces {\mathop{W}\limits^\circ}^2_n are considered for different n. One has shown that for even functions in \mathop{W}\limits^\circ{}^2_n and \mathop{W}\limits^\circ{}^2_m spectra of functionals do not intersect for m=n+1, n+2. The neccesary conditions for two spectra to intersect are written for \Delta=m-n>2.
