This work is focused on the local eigenvalue statistics for the Anderson tight binding model with non-rank-one perturbations over the canopy tree, at large disorder. On the Hilbert space \ell^2(\mathcal{C}), where  \mathcal{C}  is the canopy tree, the random operator we consider is \Delta_{\mathcal{C}}+\sum_{y\in J}\omega_y P_y, where \Delta_{\mathcal{C}} is the adjacency operator over the tree, \{\omega_y\}_{y\in J} are i.i.d real random variables following some absolutely continuous distribution having a bounded density with compact support, and P_y are projections on \ell^2(\{x\in\mathcal{C}: dist(y,x)< m_0 \& y\prec x\}). For this operator, we show that, the eigenvalue-counting point process converges to compound Poisson process.
