We derive a correspondence between the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix A and the signless Laplacian matrix Q of a graph G when G is (d_1,d_2)-biregular by using the relation A^2=(Q-d_1I)(Q-d_2I). This motivates asking when it is possible to have X^r=f(Y) for f a polynomial, r>0, and X,\ Y matrices associated to a graph G. It turns out that, essentially, this can only happen if G is either regular or biregular.
