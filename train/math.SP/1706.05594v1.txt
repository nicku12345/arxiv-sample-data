We give a new characterization of Browders theorem through equality between the pseudo B-Weyl spectrum and the generalized Drazin spectrum. Also, we will give conditions under which pseudo B-Fredholm and pseudo B-Weyl spectrum introduced in [11] and [30] become stable under commuting Riesz perturbations.
