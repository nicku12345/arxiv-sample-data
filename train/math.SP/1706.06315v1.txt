We analyze a general class of difference operators H_\varepsilon = T_\varepsilon + V_\varepsilon on \ell^2(\varepsilon\mathbf{Z}^d), where V_\varepsilon is a multi-well potential and \varepsilon is a small parameter. We derive full asymptotic expansions of the prefactor of the exponentially small eigenvalue splitting due to interactions between two "wells" (minima) of the potential energy, i.e., for the discrete tunneling effect. We treat both the case where there is a single minimal geodesic (with respect to the natural Finsler metric induced by the leading symbol h_0(x,\xi) of H_\varepsilon) connecting the two minima and the case where the minimal geodesics form an \ell+1 dimensional manifold, \ell\geq 1. These results on the tunneling problem are as sharp as the classical results for the Schr\"odinger operator in \cite{hesjo}. Technically, our approach is pseudodifferential and we adapt techniques from \cite{hesjo2} and \cite{hepar} to our discrete setting.
