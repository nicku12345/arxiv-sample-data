The aim of this work is to study the existence of a periodic solutions of third order differential equations z'''(t) = Az(t) + f(t) with the periodic condition x(0) = x(2\pi), x'(0) = x'(2\pi) and x''(0) = x''(2\pi). Our approach is based on the R-boundedness and L^{p}-multiplier of linear operators.
