Continuing the series of works following Weyl's one-term asymptotic formula for the counting function N(\lambda)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty(\lambda_n{-}\lambda)_- of the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian and the much later found two-term expansion on domains with highly regular boundary by Ivrii and Melrose, we prove a two-term asymptotic expansion of the N-th Ces\`aro mean of the eigenvalues of \sqrt{-\Delta + m^2} - m for m>0 with Dirichlet boundary condition on a bounded domain \Omega\subset\mathbb R^d for d\geq 2, extending a result by Frank and Geisinger for the fractional Laplacian (m=0) and improving upon the small-time asymptotics of the heat trace Z(t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-t \lambda_n} by Ba\~nuelos et al. and Park and Song.
