Given a Riemannian manifold, Weyl's law indicates how the spectrum of the Laplacian behaves asymptotically. Because of that result, there has been a growing interest in finding geometrical bounds compatible with this law. In the case of hypersurfaces, the isoperimetric ratio is a natural geometrical quantity, that allows to bound the spectrum from above. We investigate the problem and find an example of hypersurface where the eigenvalues are minorated by the isoperimetric ratio.
