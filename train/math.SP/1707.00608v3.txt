We study the behavior of the spectrum of the Dirac operator together with a symmetric W^{1, \infty}-potential on spin manifolds under a collapse of codimension one with bounded sectional curvature and diameter. If there is an induced spin structure on the limit space N then there are convergent eigenvalues which converge to the spectrum of a first order differential operator D on N together with a symmetric W^{1,\infty}-potential. If N is orientable and the dimension of the limit space is even then D is the Dirac operator D^N on N and if the dimension of the limit space is odd, then D = D^N \oplus -D^N.
