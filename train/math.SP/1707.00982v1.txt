A self-adjoint first order system with Hermitian \pi-periodic potential Q(z), integrable on compact sets, is considered. It is shown that all zeros of \Delta + 2e^{-i\int_0^\pi \Im q dt} are double zeros if and only if this self-adjoint system is unitarily equivalent to one in which Q(z) is \frac{\pi}{2}-periodic. Furthermore, the zeros of \Delta - 2e^{-i\int_0^\pi \Im q dt} are all double zeros if and only if the associated self-adjoint system is unitarily equivalent to one in which Q(z) = \sigma_2 Q(z) \sigma_2. Here \Delta denotes the discriminant of the system and \sigma_0, \sigma_2 are Pauli matrices. Finally, it is shown that all instability intervals vanish if and only if Q = r\sigma_0 + q\sigma_2, for some real valued \pi-periodic functions r and q integrable on compact sets.
