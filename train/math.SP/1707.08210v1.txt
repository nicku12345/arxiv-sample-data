The goal of the paper is to investigate the dynamics of the eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville operator with summable PT-symmetric potential on the finite interval. It turns out that the case of a complex Airy operator presents an exactly solvable model which allows us to trace the dynamics of the movement of the eigenvalues in all details and to find explicitly the critical parameter values, in particular, to specify precisely the number \varepsilon_1 such that for 0<\varepsilon<\varepsilon_1 the operator has a real spectrum and is similar to a self-adjoint operator.
