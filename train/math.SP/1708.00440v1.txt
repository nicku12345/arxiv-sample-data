The paper presents evidence that Riemann's xi function evaluated at 2 sqrt(E) could be the characteristic function P(E) for the magnetic Laplacian minus 85/16 on a surface of curvature -1 with magnetic field 9/4, a cusp of width 1, a DIrichlet condition at a point, and other conditions not yet determined.
