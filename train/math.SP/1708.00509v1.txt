We show that the generalized Reynolds number (in fluid dynamics) introduced by Ladyzhenskaya is closely related to the rotation of the positive spectral subspace of the Stokes block-operator in the underlying Hilbert space. We also explicitly evaluate the bottom of the negative spectrum of the Stokes operator and prove a sharp inequality relating the distance from the bottom of its spectrum to the origin and the length of the first positive gap.
