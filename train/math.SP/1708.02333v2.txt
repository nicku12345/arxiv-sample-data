Under suitable hypotheses, a symplectic map can be quantized as a sequence of unitary operators acting on the Nth powers of a positive line bundle over a K\"{a}hler manifold. We show that if the symplectic map has polynomial decay of correlations, then there exists a density one subsequence of eigensections whose masses and zeros become equidistributed in balls of logarithmically shrinking radii of lengths \lvert \log N \rvert^{-\gamma} for some constant \gamma > 0 independent of N.
