In [LS], it is shown shown that the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian restricted to the space of invariant functions on a toric K\"ahler manifold (i.e. \lambda_1^\mathbb{T}, the invariant first eigenvalue) is an unbounded function of the toric K\"ahler metric. In this note we show that, seen as a function on the space of toric K\"ahler metrics on a fixed toric manifold, \lambda_1^\mathbb{T} admits no analytic critical points. We also show that on S^2, the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian restricted to the space of S^1-equivariant functions of any given integer weight admits no critical points.
