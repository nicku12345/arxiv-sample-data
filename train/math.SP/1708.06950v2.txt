The aim of this paper is to prove a local version of the circular law for non-Hermitian random matrices and its generalization to the product of non-Hermitian random matrices under weak moment conditions. More precisely we assume that the entries X_{jk}^{(q)} of non-Hermitian random matrices {\bf X}^{(q)}, 1 \le j,k \le n, q = 1, \ldots, m, m \geq 1 are i.i.d. r.v. with \mathbb E X_{jk} =0, \mathbb E X_{jk}^2 = 1 and \mathbb E |X_{jk}|^{4+\delta} < \infty for some \delta > 0. It is shown that the local law holds on the optimal scale n^{-1+2a}, a > 0, up to some logarithmic factor. We further develop a Stein type method to estimate the perturbation of the equations for the Stieltjes transform of the limiting distribution. We also generalize the recent results [Bourgade--Yau-Yin, 2014], [Tao--Vu, 2015] and [Nemish, 2017]. An extension to the case of non-i.i.d. entries is discussed.
