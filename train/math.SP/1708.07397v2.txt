A square matrix of order n with n\geq 2 is called permutative matrix when all its rows (up to the frst one) are permutations of precisely its frst row. In this paper recalling spectral results for partitioned into 2-by-2 symmetric blocks matrices sufcient conditions on a given complex list to be the list of the eigenvalues of a nonnegative permutative matrix are given. In particular, we study NIEP and PNIEP when some complex elements into the considered lists have no zero imaginary part. Realizability regions for nonnegative permutative matrices are obtained.
