The purpose of this paper is to derive sharp asymptotics of the ground state energy for the heavy atoms and molecules in the relativistic settings, with the self-generated magnetic field, and, in particular, to derive relativistic Scott correction term and also Dirac, Schwinger and relativistic correction terms. Also we will prove that Thomas-Fermi density approximates the actual density of the ground state, which opens the way to estimate the excessive negative and positive charges and the ionization energy.
