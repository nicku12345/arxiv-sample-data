Partial Bergman kernels \Pi_{k, E} are kernels of orthogonal projections onto subspaces \mathcal{k} \subset H^0(M, L^k) of holomorphic sections of the kth power of an ample line bundle over a Kahler manifold (M, \omega). The subspaces of this article are spectral subspaces \{\hat{H}_k \leq E\} of the Toeplitz quantization \hat{H}_k of a smooth Hamiltonian H: M \to \mathbb{R}. It is shown that the relative partial density of states \frac{\Pi_{k, E}(z)}{\Pi_k(z)} \to {1}_{\mathcal{A}} where \mathcal{A} = \{H < E\}. Moreover it is shown that this partial density of states exhibits `Erf'-asymptotics along the interface \partial \mathcal{A}, that is, the density profile asymptotically has a Gaussian error function shape interpolating between the values 1,0 of {1}_{\mathcal{A}}. Such `erf'-asymptotics are a universal edge effect. The different types of scaling asymptotics are reminiscent of the law of large numbers and central limit theorem
