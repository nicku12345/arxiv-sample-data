In this paper, the authors consider leaf spaces of singular Riemannian foliations \mathcal{F} on compact manifolds M and the associated \mathcal{F}-basic spectrum on M, spec_B(M, \mathcal{F}), counted with multiplicities. Recently, a notion of smooth isometry \varphi: M_1/\mathcal{F}_1\rightarrow M_2/\mathcal{F}_2 between the leaf spaces of such singular Riemannian foliations (M_1,\mathcal{F}_1) and (M_2,\mathcal{F}_2) has appeared in the literature. In this paper, the authors provide an example to show that the existence a smooth isometry of leaf spaces as above is not sufficient to guarantee the equality of spec_B(M_1,\mathcal{F}_1) and spec_B(M_2,\mathcal{F}_2). The authors then prove that if some additional conditions involving the geometry of the leaves are satisfied, then the equality of spec_B(M_1,\mathcal{F}_1) and spec_B(M_2,\mathcal{F}_2) is guaranteed. Consequences and applications to orbifold spectral theory, isometric group actions, and their reductions are also explored.
