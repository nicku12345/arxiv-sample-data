Let  X = \Gamma\setminus \mathbb{H}  be a non-elementary geometrically finite hyperbolic surface and let  \delta  denote the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set  \Lambda(\Gamma) . We prove that for every  \varepsilon > 0  the surface  X  admits a finite cover  X'  such that the Selberg zeta function associated to  X'  has a zero  s\neq \delta  with  | \delta - s| < \varepsilon . For  \delta > \frac{1}{2}  we exploit the combinatorial interpretation of spectral gap in terms of expander graphs. For  \delta \leq \frac{1}{2}  the proof is based on the thermodynamic formalism approach for L-functions associated to hyperbolic surfaces and an analogue of the Artin-Takagi formula for these L-functions.
