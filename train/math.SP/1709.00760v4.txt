We initiate the study of Selberg zeta functions Z_{\Gamma,\chi} for geometrically finite Fuchsian groups \Gamma and finite-dimensional representations \chi with non-expanding cusp monodromy. We show that for all choices of (\Gamma,\chi), the Selberg zeta function Z_{\Gamma,\chi} converges on some half-plane in \mathbb{C}. In addition, under the assumption that \Gamma admits a strict transfer operator approach, we show that Z_{\Gamma,\chi} extends meromorphically to all of \mathbb{C}.
