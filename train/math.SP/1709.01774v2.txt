In this work, we focus on the multiplicity of singular spectrum for operators of the form A^\omega=A+\sum_{n}\omega_n C_n on a separable Hilbert space \mathcal{H}, for a self-adjoint operator A and a countable collection \{C_n\}_{n} of non-negative finite rank operators. When \{\omega_n\}_n are independent real random variables with absolutely continuous distributions, we show that the multiplicity of singular spectrum is almost surely bounded above by the maximum algebraic multiplicity of eigenvalues of \sqrt{C_n}(A^\omega-z)^{-1}\sqrt{C_n} for all n and almost all (z,\omega). The result is optimal in the sense that there are operators where the bound is achieved. Using this, we also provide effective bounds on multiplicity of singular spectrum for some special cases.
