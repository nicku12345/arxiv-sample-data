We study the behaviour of the first eigenfunction of the Dirichlet Laplacian on a planar convex domain near its maximum. We show that the eccentricity and orientation of the superlevel sets of the eigenfunction stabilise as they approach the maximum, uniformly with respect to the eccentricity of the domain itself. This is achieved by obtaining quantitatively sharp second derivative estimates, which are consistent with the shape of the superlevel sets. In particular, we prove that the eigenfunction is concave (rather than merely log concave) in an entire superlevel set near its maximum. By estimating the mixed second and third derivatives partial derivatives of the eigenfunction, we also determine the rate at which a degree 2 Taylor polynomial approximates the eigenfunction itself.
