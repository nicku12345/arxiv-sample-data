We consider the Schr\"odinger operator -\Delta+V for negative potentials V, on open sets with positive first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplacian. We show that the spectrum of -\Delta+V is positive, provided that V is greater than a negative multiple of the logarithmic gradient of the solution to the Lane-Emden equation -\Delta u=u^{q-1} (for some 1\le q< 2). In this case, the ground state energy of -\Delta+V is greater than the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplacian, up to an explicit multiplicative factor. This is achieved by means of suitable Hardy-type inequalities, that we prove in this paper.
