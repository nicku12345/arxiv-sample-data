We give an explicit formula for the second variation of the logarithm of the Selberg zeta function, Z(s), on Teichm\"uller space. We then use this formula to determine the asymptotic behavior as \text{Re} (s) \to \infty of the second variation. As a consequence, for m \in \mathbb{N}, we obtain the complete expansion in m of the curvature of the vector bundle H^0(X_t, \mathcal K_t)\to t\in \mathcal T of holomorphic m-differentials over the Teichm\"uller space \mathcal T, for m large. Moreover, we show that this curvature agrees with the Quillen curvature up to a term of exponential decay, O(m^2 e^{-l_0 m}), where l_0 is the length of the shortest closed hyperbolic geodesic.
