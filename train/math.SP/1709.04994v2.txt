The spectrum of the singular indefinite Sturm-Liouville operator A=\text{\rm sgn}(\cdot)\bigl(-\tfrac{d^2}{dx^2}+q\bigr) with a real potential q\in L^1(\mathbb R) covers the whole real line and, in addition, non-real eigenvalues may appear if the potential q assumes negative values. A quantitative analysis of the non-real eigenvalues is a challenging problem, and so far only partial results in this direction were obtained. In this paper the bound |\lambda|\leq |q|_{L^1}^2 on the absolute values of the non-real eigenvalues \lambda of A is obtained. Furthermore, separate bounds on the imaginary parts and absolute values of these eigenvalues are proved in terms of the L^1-norm of the negative part of q.
