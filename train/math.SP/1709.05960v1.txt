Let us say that an n-sided polygon is semi-regular if it is circumscriptible and its angles are all equal but possibly one, which is then larger than the rest. Regular polygons, in particular, are semi-regular. We prove that semi-regular polygons are spectrally determined in the class of convex piecewise smooth domains. Specifically, we show that if \Omega is a convex piecewise smooth planar domain, possibly with straight corners, whose Dirichlet or Neumann spectrum coincides with that of an n-sided semi-regular polygon P_n, then \Omega is congruent to P_n.
