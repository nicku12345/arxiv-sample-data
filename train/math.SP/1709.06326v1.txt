A Helson matrix (also known as a multiplicative Hankel matrix) is an infinite matrix with entries \{a(jk)\} for j,k\geq1. Here the (j,k)'th term depends on the product jk. We study a self-adjoint Helson matrix for a particular sequence a(j)=(\sqrt{j}\log j(\log\log j)^\alpha))^{-1}, j\geq 3, where \alpha>0, and prove that it is compact and that its eigenvalues obey the asymptotics \lambda_n\sim\varkappa(\alpha)/n^\alpha as n\to\infty, with an explicit constant \varkappa(\alpha). We also establish some intermediate results (of an independent interest) which give a connection between the spectral properties of a Helson matrix and those of its continuous analogue, which we call the integral Helson operator.
