We study L-systems with sectorial main operator and connections of their impedance functions with sectorial Stieltjes and inverse Stieltjes functions. Conditions when the main and state space operators (the main and associated state space operators) of a given L-system have the same or not angle of sectoriality are presented in terms of their impedance functions with discussion provided. Detailed analysis of L-systems with one-dimensional sectorial Shro\"odinger operator on half-line is given as well as connections with the Kato problem on sectorial extensions of sectorial forms. Examples that illustrate the obtained results are presented.
