We study eigenvalues of non-self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators on non-trapping asymptotically conic manifolds of dimension n\ge 3. Specifically, we are concerned with the following two types of estimates. The first one deals with Keller type bounds on individual eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger operator with a complex potential in terms of the L^p-norm of the potential, while the second one is a Lieb-Thirring type bound controlling sums of powers of eigenvalues in terms of the L^p-norm of the potential. We extend the results of Frank (2011), Frank-Sabin (2017), and Frank-Simon (2017) on the Keller and Lieb-Thirring type bounds from the case of Euclidean spaces to that of non-trapping asymptotically conic manifolds. In particular, our results are valid for the operator \Delta_g+V on \mathbb{R}^n with g being a non-trapping compactly supported (or suitably short range) perturbation of the Euclidean metric and V\in L^p complex valued.
