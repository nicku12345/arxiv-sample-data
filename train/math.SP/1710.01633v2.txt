We derive new estimates for the number of discrete eigenvalues of compactly perturbed operators on Banach spaces, assuming that the perturbing operator is an element of a weak entropy number ideal. Our results improve upon earlier results by the author and by Demuth et al. The main tool in our proofs is an inequality of Carl. In particular, in contrast to all previous results we do not rely on tools from complex analysis.
