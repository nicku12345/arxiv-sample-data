We consider a class of compact Toeplitz operators on the Bergman space on the unit disk. The symbols of operators in our class are assumed to have a sufficiently regular power-like behaviour near the boundary of the disk. We compute the asymptotics of singular values of this class of Toeplitz operators. We use this result to obtain the asymptotics of singular values for a class of banded matrices.
