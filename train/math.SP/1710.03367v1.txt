For the pair \{-\Delta, -\Delta-\alpha\delta_\mathcal{C}\} of self-adjoint Schr\"{o}dinger operators in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) a spectral shift function is determined in an explicit form with the help of (energy parameter dependent) Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps. Here \delta_{\cal{C}} denotes a singular \delta-potential which is supported on a smooth compact hypersurface \mathcal{C}\subset\mathbb{R}^n and \alpha is a real-valued function on \mathcal{C}.
