If c_1(Z) \geq ... \geq c_n(Z) denote the Euclidean lengths of the column vectors of any n \times n matrix Z, then a fundamental inequality related to Hadamard products states that    \sum_{i=1}^k \sigma_i(X^*Y \circ B) \leq \sum_{i=1}^k c_i(X) c_i(Y) \sigma_i(B) \qquad 1 \leq k \leq n, where \sigma_i(\cdot) is the ith singular value. In this paper, we shall offer a simple proof of this result via convexity arguments. In addition, this technique is applied to obtain some further singular value inequalities as well.
