Let \Gamma be a convex co-compact discrete group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane \mathbb{H}^2, and X=\Gamma\backslash \mathbb{H}^2 the associated surface. In this paper we investigate the behaviour of resonances of the Laplacian for large degree covers of X given by a finite index normal subgroup of \Gamma. Using various techniques of thermodynamical formalism and representation theory, we prove two new existence results of "sharp non-trivial resonances" close to \Re(s)=\delta_\Gamma, both in the large degree limit, for abelian covers and also infinite index congruence subgroups of SL2(\mathbb{Z}).
