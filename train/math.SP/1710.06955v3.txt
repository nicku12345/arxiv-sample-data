In 1961, Birman proved a sequence of inequalities \{I_{n}\}, for n\in\mathbb{N}, valid for functions in C_0^{n}((0,\infty))\subset L^{2}((0,\infty)). In particular, I_{1} is the classical (integral) Hardy inequality and I_{2} is the well-known Rellich inequality. In this paper, we give a proof of this sequence of inequalities valid on a certain Hilbert space H_{n}([0,\infty)) of functions defined on [0,\infty). Moreover, f\in H_{n}([0,\infty)) implies f^{\prime}\in H_{n-1}([0,\infty)); as a consequence of this inclusion, we see that the classical Hardy inequality implies each of the inequalities in Birman's sequence. We also show that for any finite b>0, these inequalities hold on the standard Sobolev space H_0^{n}((0,b)). Furthermore, in all cases, the Birman constants [(2n-1)!!]^{2}/2^{2n} in these inequalities are sharp and the only function that gives equality in any of these inequalities is the trivial function in L^{2}((0,\infty)) (resp., L^2((0,b))). We also show that these Birman constants are related to the norm of a generalized continuous Ces\`aro averaging operator whose spectral properties we determine in detail.
