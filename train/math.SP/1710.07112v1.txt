Spectral analysis of operator-functions which are the symbols of the abstract integrodifferential equations of the Gurtin-Pipkin is provided. These equations represent abstract wave equations disturbed by terms involving Volterra operators. Correct solvability in the Sobolev space W_{2}^{2}((0, T), A^2), for arbitrary T>0, of that abstract integrodifferential equations is also studied.
