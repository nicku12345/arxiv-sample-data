Let (M,g) be a smooth, compact Riemannian manifold and \{\phi_h\} an L^2-normalized sequence of Laplace eigenfunctions, -h^2\Delta_g\phi_h=\phi_h. Given a smooth submanifold H \subset M of codimension k\geq 1, we find conditions on the pair (\{\phi_h\},H) for which  \Big|\int_H\phi_hd\sigma_H\Big|=o(h^{\frac{1-k}{2}}),\qquad h\to 0^+.  One such condition is that the set of conormal directions to H that are recurrent has measure 0. In particular, we show that the upper bound holds for any H if (M,g) is surface with Anosov geodesic flow or a manifold of constant negative curvature. The results are obtained by characterizing the behavior of the defect measures of eigenfunctions with maximal averages.
