We study an optimal stretching problem for certain convex domain in \mathbb{R}^d (d\geq 3) whose boundary has points of vanishing Gaussian curvature. We prove that the optimal domain which contains the most positive (or least nonnegative) lattice points is asymptotically balanced. This type of problem has its origin in the "eigenvalue optimization among rectangles" problem in spectral geometry. Our proof relies on two-term bounds for lattice counting for general convex domains in \mathbb{R}^d and an explicit estimate of the Fourier transform of the characteristic function associated with the specific domain under consideration.
