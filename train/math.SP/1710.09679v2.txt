Let \Omega be a curvilinear polygon and Q^\gamma_{\Omega} be the Laplacian in L^2(\Omega), Q^\gamma_{\Omega}\psi=-\Delta \psi, with the Robin boundary condition \partial_\nu \psi=\gamma \psi, where \partial_\nu is the outer normal derivative and \gamma>0. We are interested in the behavior of the eigenvalues of Q^\gamma_\Omega as \gamma becomes large. We prove that the asymptotics of the first eigenvalues of Q^\gamma_\Omega is determined at the leading order by those of model operators associated with the vertices: the Robin Laplacians acting on the tangent sectors associated with \partial \Omega. In the particular case of a polygon with straight edges the first eigenpairs are exponentially close to those of the model operators. Finally, we prove a Weyl asymptotics for the eigenvalue counting function of Q^\gamma_\Omega for a threshold depending on \gamma, and show that the leading term is the same as for smooth domains.
