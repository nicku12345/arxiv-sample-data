We show that for a given set \Lambda of nk distinct real numbers \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_{nk} and k graphs on n nodes, G_0, G_1,\ldots,G_{k-1}, there are real symmetric n\times n matrices A_s, s=0,1,\ldots, k, such that the matrix polynomial A(z) := A_k z^k + \cdots + A_1 z + A_0 has \Lambda as its spectrum, the graph of A_s is G_s for s=0,1,\ldots,k-1, and A_k is an arbitrary positive definite diagonal matrix. When k=2, this solves a physically significant inverse eigenvalue problem for linked vibrating systems (see Corollary 5.3).
