This paper is a brief account of the Steklov eigenvalue problem on a 2-dimensional rectangular domain, and then on a 3-dimensional rectangular box. It is divided into four sections. Section 1 relies heavily on real analytic methods to show the existence of an eigenfunction class which always produces the first non-trivial Steklov eigenvalue on a rectangle. Section 2 lists all possible Steklov eigenfunctions on a cuboid. The very brief section 3 gives the 3-dimensional analogue of the analytic results in Section 1. The analogue is given as conjecture, but is expected to derivate from standard (albeit tedious) real analysis methods, should one wish to expound on these calculations. Section 4 deals with the special cases of the square and the cube.
