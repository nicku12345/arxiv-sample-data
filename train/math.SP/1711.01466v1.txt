We extend the results of Zhang et al. to show that \lambda is an eigenvalue of a k-uniform hypertree (k \geq 3) if and only if it is a root of a particular matching polynomial for a connected induced subtree. We then use this to provide a spectral characterization for power hypertrees. Notably, the situation is quite different from that of ordinary trees, i.e., 2-uniform trees. We conclude by presenting an example (an 11 vertex, 3-uniform non-power hypertree) illustrating these phenomena.
