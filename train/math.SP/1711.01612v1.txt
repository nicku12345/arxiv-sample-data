We study the spectral properties of positive absolutely minimum attaining operators defined on infinite dimensional complex Hilbert spaces and using that derive a characterization theorem for such type of operators. We construct several examples and discuss some of the properties of this class. Also, we extend this characterization theorem for general absolutely minimum attaining operators by means of the polar decomposition theorem.
