Spectral asymptotics of the Sturm-Liouville problem with a singular self-conformal weight measure is considered. A stronger version of the bounded distortion property is assumed for the conformal iterated function system corresponding to the weight measure. Under this restrictions the power exponent of the main term of the eigenvalue counting function asymptotics is obtained. This generalizes the result obtained by T. Fujita (Taniguchi Symp. PMMP Katata, 1985) in the case of self-similar (self-affine) measure.
