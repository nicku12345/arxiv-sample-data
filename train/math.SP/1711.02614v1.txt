Our goal is to compare various results for Toeplitz T and Hankel H operators. We consider semibounded operators and find necessary and sufficient conditions for their quadratic forms to be closable. This property allows one to define T and H as self-adjoint operators under minimal assumptions on their matrix elements. We also describe domains of the closed Toeplitz and Hankel quadratic forms.
