We consider a compact Riemannian manifold M (possibly with boundary) and \Sigma \subset M\setminus \partial M an interior hypersurface (possibly with boundary). We study observation and control from \Sigma for both the wave and heat equations. For the wave equation, we prove controllability from \Sigma in time T under the assumption (\mathcal{T}GCC) that all generalized bicharacteristics intersect \Sigma transversally in the time interval (0,T). For the heat equation we prove unconditional controllability from \Sigma. As a result, we obtain uniform lower bounds for the Cauchy data of Laplace eigenfunctions on \Sigma under \mathcal{T}GCC and unconditional exponential lower bounds on such Cauchy data.
