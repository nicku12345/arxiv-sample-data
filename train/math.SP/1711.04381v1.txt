We show that the ball does not maximize the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue among all contractible domains of fixed boundary volume in \mathbb{R}^n when n \geq 3. This is in contrast to the situation when n=2, where a result of Weinstock from 1954 shows that the disk uniquely maximizes the first Steklov eigenvalue among all simply connected domains in the plane having the same boundary length. When n \geq 3, we show that increasing the number of boundary components does not increase the normalized (by boundary volume) first Steklov eigenvalue. This is in contrast to recent results which have been obtained for surfaces.
