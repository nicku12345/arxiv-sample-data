We consider Sturm-Liouville operators on geometrical graphs without cycles (trees) with singular potentials from the class W_2^{-1}. We suppose that the potentials are known on a part of the graph, and study the so-called partial inverse problem, which consists in recovering the potentials on the remaining part of the graph from some parts of several spectra. The main results of the paper are the uniqueness theorem and a constructive procedure for the solution of the partial inverse problem. Our method is based on the completeness and the Riesz-basis property of special systems of vector functions, and the reduction of the partial inverse problem to the complete one on a part of the graph.
