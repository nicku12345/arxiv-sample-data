Studying the spectral theory of Schroedinger operator on metric graphs (also known as quantum graphs) is advantageous on its own as well as to demonstrate key concepts of general spectral theory. There are some excellent references for this study such as a mathematically oriented book by Berkolaiko and Kuchment, a review with applications to theoretical physicsby Gnutzmann and Smilansky, and elementary lecture notes by Berkolaiko. Here, we provide a set of questions and exercises which can accompany the reading of these references or an elementary course on quantum graphs. The exercises are taken from courses on quantum graphs which were taught by the authors.
