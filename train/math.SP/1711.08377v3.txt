We study the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on a star graph \mathcal{G}. At the vertex an interaction occurs described by a boundary condition of delta type with strength \alpha\in \mathbb{R}. We investigate an orbital instability of the standing waves e^{i\omega t}\mathbf{\Phi}(x) of NLS-\delta equation with attractive power nonlinearity on \mathcal{G} when the profile \Phi(x) has mixed structure (i.e. has bumps and tails). In our approach we essentially use the extension theory of symmetric operators by Krein - von Neumann, and the analytic perturbations theory, avoiding the variational techniques standard in the stability study. We also prove orbital stability of the unique standing wave solution of NLS-\delta equation with repulsive nonlinearity.
