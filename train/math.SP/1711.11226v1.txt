We investigate the point spectrum associated with travelling wave solutions in a Keller-Segel model for bacterial chemotaxis with small diffusivity of the chemoattractant, a logarithmic chemosensitivity function and a constant, sublinear or linear consumption rate. We show that, for constant or sublinear consumption, there is an eigenvalue at the origin of order two. This is associated with the translation invariance of the model and the existence of a continuous family of solutions with varying wave speed. These point spectrum results, in conjunction with previous results in the literature, imply that in these cases the travelling wave solutions are absolute unstable if the chemotactic coefficient is above a certain critical value, while they are transiently unstable otherwise.
