We prove new inequalities related to the spectral radius \rho of Hadamard products (denoted by \circ) of complex matrices. Let p,q\in [1,\infty] satisfy \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1, we show an analog of H\"older's inequality on the space of n\times n complex matrices \rho(A\circ B) \le \rho(|A|^{\circ p})^{\frac{1}{p}} \rho(|B|^{\circ q})^{\frac{1}{q}} \quad \text{for all A,B\in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n},}  where |\cdot| denotes entry-wise absolute values, and (\cdot)^{\circ p} represents the entry-wise Hadamard power. We derive a sharper inequality for the special case p=q=2. Given A,B\in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}, for some \beta \in (0,1] depending on A and B, \rho(A\circ B) \le \beta \rho(|A\circ A|)^{\frac{1}{2}} \rho(|B\circ B|)^{\frac{1}{2}} . Analysis for another special case p=1 and q=\infty is also included.
