We investigate the instability index of the spectral problem  -c^2y'' + b^2y + V(x)y = -\mathrm{i} z y'    on the line \mathbb{R}, where V\in L^1_{\rm loc}(\mathbb{R}) is real valued and b,c>0 are constants. This problem arises in the study of stability of solitons for certain nonlinear equations (e.g., the short pulse equation and the generalized Bullough-Dodd equation). We show how to apply the standard approach in the situation under consideration and as a result we provide a formula for the instability index in terms of certain spectral characteristics of the 1-D Schr\"odinger operator H_V=-c^2\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+b^2 +V(x).
