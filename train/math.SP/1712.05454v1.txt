The nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP) is to characterize the spectra of entrywise nonnegative matrices. A finite multiset of complex numbers is called realizable if it is the spectrum of an entrywise nonnegative matrix. Monov conjectured that the k\textsuperscript{th}-moments of the list of critical points of a realizable list are nonnegative. Johnson further conjectured that the list of critical points must be realizable. In this work, Johnson's conjecture, and consequently Monov's conjecture, is established for a variety of important cases including Ciarlet spectra, Sule\u{\i}manova spectra, spectra realizable via companion matrices, and spectra realizable via similarity by a complex Hadamard matrix. Additionally we prove a result on differentiators and trace vectors, and use it to provide an alternate proof of a result due to Malamud and a generalization of a result due to Kushel and Tyaglov on circulant matrices. Implications for further research are discussed.
