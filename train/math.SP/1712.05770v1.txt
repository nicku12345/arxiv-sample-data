We consider a bounded block operator matrix of the form  L=\left(\begin{array}{cc} A & B \\ C & D \end{array} \right),  where the main-diagonal entries A and D are self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces H_{_A} and H_{_D}, respectively; the coupling B maps H_{_D} to H_{_A} and C is an operator from H_{_A} to H_{_D}. It is assumed that the spectrum \sigma_{_D} of D is absolutely continuous and uniform, being presented by a single band [\alpha,\beta]\subset\mathbb{R}, \alpha<\beta, and the spectrum \sigma_{_A} of A is embedded into \sigma_{_D}, that is, \sigma_{_A}\subset(\alpha,\beta). We formulate conditions under which there are bounded solutions to the operator Riccati equations associated with the complexly deformed block operator matrix L; in such a case the deformed operator matrix L admits a block diagonalization. The same conditions also ensure the Markus-Matsaev-type factorization of the Schur complement M_{_A}(z)=A-z-B(D-z)^{-1}C analytically continued onto the unphysical sheet(s) of the complex z plane adjacent to the band [\alpha,\beta]. We prove that the operator roots of the continued Schur complement M_{_A} are explicitly expressed through the respective solutions to the deformed Riccati equations.
