The inverse scattering problem for the Schr\mathrm{\ddot{o}}dinger operators on the line is considered when the potential is real valued and integrable and has a finite first moment. It is shown that the potential on the line is uniquely determined by the left (or right) reflection coefficient alone provided that the potential is known on a finite interval and it is not absolutely continuous on this known interval.
