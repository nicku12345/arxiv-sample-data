We first study the discrete Schr\"odinger equations with analytic potentials given by a class of transformations. It is shown that if the coupling number is large, then its logarithm equals approximately to the Lyapunov exponents. When the transformation becomes the skew-shift, we prove that the Lyapunov exponent is week H\"older continuous, and the spectrum satisfies Anderson Localization and contains large intervals. Moreover, all of these conclusions are non-perturbative.
