We consider Schr\"odinger operators with periodic potentials in the positive quadrant for dim >1 with Dirichlet boundary condition. We show that for any integer N and any interval I there exists a periodic potential such that the Schr\"odinger operator has N eigenvalues counted with the multiplicity on this interval and there is no other spectrum on the interval. Furthermore, to the right and to the left of it there is a essential spectrum.   Moreover, we prove similar results for Schr\"odinger operators for other domains. The proof is based on the inverse spectral theory for Hill operators on the real line.
