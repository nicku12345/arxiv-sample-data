We consider 3-dim Schr\"odinger operators with a complex potential. We obtain new trace formulas. In order to prove these results we study analytic properties of a modified Fredholm determinant. In fact we reformulate spectral theory problems as the problems of analytic functions from Hardy spaces in upper half-plane.
