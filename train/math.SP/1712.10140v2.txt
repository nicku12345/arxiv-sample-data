We consider a non-selfadjoint Dirac-type differential expression   \begin{equation} D(Q)y:= J_n \frac{dy}{dx} + Q(x)y, \quad\quad\quad (1)   \end{equation} with a non-selfadjoint potential matrix Q \in L^1_{loc}({\mathcal I},\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}) and a signature matrix J_n =-J_n^{-1} = -J_n^*\in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}. Here {\mathcal I} denotes either the line \mathbb{R} or the half-line \mathbb{R}_+. With this differential expression one associates in L^2(\mathcal I,\mathbb{C}^{n}) the (closed) maximal and minimal operators D_{\max}(Q) and D_{\min}(Q), respectively. One of our main results states that D_{\max}(Q) = D_{\min}(Q) in L^2(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{n}). Moreover, we show that if the minimal operator D_{\min}(Q) in L^2(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^{n}) is j-symmetric with respect to an appropriate involution j, then it is j-selfadjoint.   Similar results are valid in the case of the semiaxis \mathbb{R}_+. In particular, we show that if n=2p and the minimal operator D_{\min}(Q) in L^2(\mathbb{R}_+,\mathbb{C}^{2p}) is j-symmetric, then there exists a 2p\times p-Weyl-type matrix solution \Psi(z, \cdot)\in L^2(\mathbb{R}_+,\mathbb{C}^{2p\times p}) of the equation D^+_{\max}(Q)\Psi(z, \cdot)= z\Psi(z, \cdot). A similar result is valid for the expression (1) with a potential matrix having a bounded imaginary part. This leads to the existence of a unique Weyl function for the expression (1).   The differential expression (1) is of significance as it appears in the Lax formulation of the vector-valued nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation.
