We consider Berezin-Toeplitz operators whose multipliers are compactly supported densities carried by a submanifold of {\mathbb C}^N . We compute asymptotically the moments of their spectral measures, and we prove Szeg\"o limit theorems in cases when the submanifold is isotropic or co-isotropic, from which Weyl estimates follow. We also obtain asymptotics of the Schatten norms of such operators. Rescaled versions of these operators can be thought of as quantum mechanical mixed states, and our results give the semi-classical limit of their entropy.
