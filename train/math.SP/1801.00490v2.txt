We prove a general weak existence theorem for wave operators for hybrid normed ideal perturbations. We then use this result to prove the invariance of Lebesgue absolutely continuous parts of n-tuples of commuting hermitian operators under hybrid normed ideal perturbations from a class studied in the first paper of this series.
