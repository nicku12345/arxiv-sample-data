We generalize our former localization result about the principal Dirichlet eigenvector of the i.i.d. heavy-tailed random conductance Laplacian to the first k eigenvectors. We overcome the complication that the higher eigenvectors have fluctuating signs by invoking the Bauer-Fike theorem to show that the kth eigenvector is close to the principal eigenvector of an auxiliary spectral problem.
