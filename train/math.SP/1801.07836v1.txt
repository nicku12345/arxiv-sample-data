In this paper we construct compact manifolds with fixed boundary geometry which admit Riemannian metrics of unit volume with arbitrarily large Steklov spectral gap. We also study the effect of localized conformal deformations that fix the boundary geometry. For instance, we prove that it is possible to make the spectral gap arbitrarily large using conformal deformations which are localized on domains of small measure, as long as the support of the deformations contains and connects each component of the boundary.
