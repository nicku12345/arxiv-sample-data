Let \mathcal{B}(X) be the algebra of all bounded operators acting on an infinite dimensional complex Banach space X. We say that an operator T \in \mathcal{B}(X) satisfies the problem of descent spectrum equality, if the descent spectrum of T as an operator coincides with the descent spectrum of T as an element of the algebra of all bounded linear operators on X. In this paper we are interested in the problem of descent spectrum equality . Specifically, the problem is to consider the following question: Let T \in \mathcal{B}(X) such that \sigma(T) has non empty interior, under which condition on T does \sigma_{desc}(T)=\sigma_{desc}(T, \mathcal{B}(X)) ?
