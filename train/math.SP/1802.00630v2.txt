Let (M_i, g_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}} be a sequence of spin manifolds with uniform bounded curvature and diameter that converges to a lower dimensional Riemannian manifold (B,h) in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. Lott showed that the spectrum converges to the spectrum of a certain first order elliptic differential operator \mathcal{D} on B. In this article we give an explicit description of \mathcal{D}^B. We conclude that \mathcal{D}^B is self-adjoint and characterize the special case where \mathcal{D}^B is the Dirac operator on B.
