We study spectral instability of steady states to the linearized 2D Euler equations on the torus written in vorticity form via certain Birman-Schwinger type operators K_{\lambda}(\mu) and their associated 2-modified perturbation determinants \mathcal D(\lambda,\mu). Our main result characterizes the existence of an unstable eigenvalue to the linearized vorticity operator L_{\rm vor} in terms of zeros of the 2-modified Fredholm determinant \mathcal D(\lambda,0)=\det_{2}(I-K_{\lambda}(0)) associated with the Hilbert Schmidt operator K_{\lambda}(\mu) for \mu=0. As a consequence, we are also able to provide an alternative proof to an instability theorem first proved by Zhiwu Lin which relates existence of an unstable eigenvalue for L_{\rm vor} to the number of negative eigenvalues of a limiting elliptic dispersion operator A_{0}.
