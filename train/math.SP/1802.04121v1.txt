In this study, we give the Sturm comparison theorems for discrete fractional Sturm-Liouville (DFSL) equations within Riemann-Liouville and Gr\"unwald-Letnikov sense. The emergence of Sturm-Liouville equations began as one dimensional Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics and one of the most important results is Sturm comparison theorems [27]. These theorems give information about the properties of zeros of two equations having different potentials.
