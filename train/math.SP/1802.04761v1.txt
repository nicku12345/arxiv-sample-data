An integro-differential Dirac system with an integral term in the form of convolution is considered. We suppose that the convolution kernel is known a priori on a part of the interval, and recover it on the remaining part, using a part of the spectrum. We prove the uniqueness theorem, provide an algorithm for the solution of the inverse problem together with necessary and sufficient conditions for its solvability.
