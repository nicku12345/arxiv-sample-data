This note deals with the operator T^*T, where T is a densely defined operator on a complex Hilbert space. We reprove a recent result of Z. Sebesty\'en and Zs. Tarcsay [13]: If T^*T and TT^* are self-adjoint, then T is closed. In addition, we describe the Friedrichs extension of S^2, where S is a symmetric operator, recovering results due to Yu. Arlinski\u{i} and Yu. Kovalev [1], [2].
