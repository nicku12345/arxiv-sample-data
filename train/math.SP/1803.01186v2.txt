We discuss explicit landscape functions for quantum graphs. By a "landscape function" \Upsilon(x) we mean a function that controls the localization properties of normalized eigenfunctions \psi(x) through a pointwise inequality of the form  |\psi(x)| \le \Upsilon(x).  The ideal \Upsilon is a function that   a) responds to the potential energy V(x) and to the structure of the graph in some formulaic way;   b) is small in examples where eigenfunctions are suppressed by the tunneling effect, and   c) relatively large in regions where eigenfunctions may - or may not - be concentrated, as observed in specific examples.   It turns out that the connectedness of a graph can present a barrier to the existence of universal landscape functions in the high-energy r\'egime, as we show with simple examples. We therefore apply different methods in different r\'egimes determined by the values of the potential energy V(x) and the eigenvalue parameter E.
