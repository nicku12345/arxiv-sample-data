We prove compactness of a restricted set of real-valued, compactly supported potentials V for which the corresponding Schr\"odinger operators H_V have the same resonances, including multiplicities. More specifically, let B_R(0) be the ball of radius R > 0 about the origin in R^d, for d=1,3. Let \mathcal{I}_R (V_0) be the set of real-valued potentials in C_0^\infty( \overline{B}_R(0); R) so that the corresponding Schr\"odinger operators have the same resonances, including multiplicities, as H_{V_0}. We prove that the set \mathcal{I}_R (V_0) is a compact subset of C_0^\infty (\overline{B}_R(0)) in the C^\infty-topology. An extension to Sobolev spaces of less regular potentials is discussed.
