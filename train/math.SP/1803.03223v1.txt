For a Riemannian covering p \colon M_{2} \to M_{1}, we compare the spectrum of an essentially self-adjoint differential operator D_{1} on a bundle E_{1} \to M_{1} with the spectrum of its lift D_{2} on p^{*}E_{1} \to M_{2}. We prove that if the covering is infinite sheeted and amenable, then the spectrum of D_{1} is contained in the essential spectrum of any self-adjoint extension of D_{2}. We show that if the deck transformations group of the covering is infinite and D_{2} is essentially self-adjoint (or symmetric and bounded from below), then D_{2} (or the Friedrichs extension of D_{2}) does not have eigenvalues of finite multiplicity and in particular, its spectrum is essential. Moreover, we prove that if M_{1} is closed, then p is amenable if and only if it preserves the bottom of the spectrum of some/any Schr\"{o}dinger operator, extending a result due to Brooks.
