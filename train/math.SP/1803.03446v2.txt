Given a convex co-compact hyperbolic surface X=\Gamma\backslash \mathbb{H}^2, we investigate the resonance spectrum \mathcal{R}_j of the laplacian \Delta_j on large finite abelian covers X=\Gamma_j\backslash \mathbb{H}^2, where \Gamma_j is a finite index normal subgroup of \Gamma. Let \delta be the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of \Gamma. We show that there exists an \varepsilon>0, such that for all j, resonances \mathcal{R}_j in \{ \delta-\varepsilon< \mathrm{Re}(s) \leq \delta \} are all real and satisfy a Weyl law given by the degree of the cover i.e. \vert \Gamma/ \Gamma_j\vert. In particular, we prove that for large imaginary parts, there is a uniform resonance gap, obtained through uniform Dolgopyat estimates for transfer operators. One of the new ingredients of the proof is the decay of oscillatory integrals with respect to Patterson-Sulivan measures, obtained recently by Bourgain-Dyatlov arXiv:1704.02909 .
