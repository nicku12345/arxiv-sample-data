This article is a first attempt to obtain weak limit formulas for weighted means of orthogonal polynomials. For this, we introduce a new mean Nevai class that guarantees the existence of an equilibrium measure for the limit of the means. We show that for a family of measures in this mean Nevai class also the means of the Christoffel-Darboux kernels and the asymptotic distribution of the roots converge weakly to the same equilibrium measure. As a main example, we study the mean Nevai classes in which the equilibrium measure is the orthogonality measure of the ultraspherical polynomials. The respective weak limit formula can be regarded as an asymptotic weak addition formula for the corresponding class of measures.
