In this note self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators are investigated by using the abstract technique of quasi boundary triples and their Weyl functions. The main result is an extension of Theorem 2.6 in [5] which provides sufficient conditions on the parameter in the boundary space to induce self-adjoint realizations. As an example self-adjoint Robin Laplacians on the half-space with boundary conditions involving an unbounded coefficient are considered.
