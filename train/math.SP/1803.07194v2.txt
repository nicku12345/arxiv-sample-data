We study a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with logarithmic nonlinearity on a star graph \mathcal{G}. At the vertex an interaction occurs described by a boundary condition of delta type with strength \alpha\in \mathbb{R}. We investigate orbital stability and spectral instability of the standing wave solutions e^{i\omega t}\mathbf{\Phi}(x) to the equation when the profile \mathbf\Phi(x) has mixed structure (i.e. has bumps and tails). In our approach we essentially use the extension theory of symmetric operators by Krein - von Neumann, and the analytic perturbations theory.
