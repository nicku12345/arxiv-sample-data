Let a_{\nu,k} be the k-th positive zero of the cross-product of Bessel functions J_\nu(R z) Y_\nu(z) - J_\nu(z) Y_\nu(R z), where \nu\geq 0 and R>1. We derive an initial value problem for a first order differential equation whose solution \alpha(x) characterizes the limit behavior of a_{\nu,k} in the following sense:  \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_{kx,k}}{k} = \alpha(x), \quad x \geq 0.  Moreover, we show that  a_{\nu,k} < \frac{\pi k}{R-1} + \frac{\pi \nu}{2R}.  We use \alpha(x) to obtain an explicit expression of the Pleijel constant for planar annuli and compute some of its values.
