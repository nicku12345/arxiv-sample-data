Spectral asymptotics of a tensor product of compact operators in Hilbert space with known marginal asymptotics is studied. Methods of A. Karol', A. Nazarov and Ya. Nikitin (Trans. AMS, 2008) are generalized for operators with almost regular marginal asymptotics. In many (but not all) cases it is shown, that tensor product has almost regular asymptotics as well. Obtained results are then applied to the theory of small ball probabilities of Gaussian random fields.
