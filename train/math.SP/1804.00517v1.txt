We are concerned in this article with a classical question in spectral geometry dating back to McKean-Singer, Patodi and Tanno: whether or not the constancy of holomorphic sectional curvature of a complex n-dimensional compact K\"ahler manifold can be completely determined by the eigenvalues of its p-Laplacian for a \emph{single} integer p? We treat this question in this article under two Einstein-type conditions: cohomologically Einstein and Fano Einstein. Building on our previous work, we show that for cohomologically Einstein K\"ahler manifolds this is true for all but finitely many pairs (p,n). As a consequence, the standard complex projective spaces can be characterized among cohomologically Einstein K\"ahler manifolds in terms of a single spectral set in all these cases. Moreover, in the case of p=0, we show that the complex projective spaces can be characterized among Fano K\"ahler-Einstein manifolds only in terms of the first nonzero eigenvalue with multiplicity, which has a similar flavor to a recent remarkable result due to Kento Fujita.
