Let T:H_1\rightarrow H_2 be a bounded linear operator defined between complex Hilbert spaces H_1 and H_2. We say T to be \textit{minimum attaining} if there exists a unit vector x\in H_1 such that \|Tx\|=m(T), where m(T):=\inf{\{\|Tx\|:x\in H_1,\; \|x\|=1}\} is the \textit{minimum modulus} of T. We say T to be \textit{absolutely minimum attaining} (\mathcal{AM}-operators in short), if for any closed subspace M of H_1 the restriction operator T|_M:M\rightarrow H_2 is minimum attaining.   In this paper, we give a new characterization of positive absolutely minimum attaining operators (\mathcal{AM}-operators, in short), in terms of its essential spectrum. Using this we obtain a sufficient condition under which the adjoint of an \mathcal{AM}-operator is \mathcal{AM}.   We show that a paranormal absolutely minimum attaining operator is hyponormal. Finally, we establish a spectral decomposition of normal absolutely minimum attaining operators. In proving all these results we prove several spectral results for paranormal operators. We illustrate our main result with an example.
