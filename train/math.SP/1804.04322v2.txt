We study fractal dimension properties of singular Jacobi operators. We prove quantitative lower spectral/quantum dynamical bounds for general operators with strong repetition properties and controlled singularities. For analytic quasiperiodic Jacobi operators in the positive Lyapunov exponent regime, we obtain a sharp arithmetic criterion of full spectral dimensionality. The applications include the extended Harper's model where we obtain arithmetic results on spectral dimensions and quantum dynamical exponents.
