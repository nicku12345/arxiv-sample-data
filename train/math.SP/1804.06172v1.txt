In this paper we consider a linear system modeling the vibrations of two nonhomogeneous Euler-Bernoulli beams connected by a point mass. This system is generated by the following equations\bea &&\rho(x)y_{tt}(t,x)+(\sigma(x)y_{xx}(t,x))_{xx}-(q(x)y_{x}(t,x))_{x}=0,~t>0,~x \in (-1,0)\cup(0,1), &&M y_{tt}(t,0)=\({T}y(t,x)\)_{\mid_{x=0^-}}-\({T}y(t,x)\)_{\mid_{x=0^+}},~~t>0,\eea with hinged boundary conditions at both ends, where {T}y = (\se(x)y_{xx})_{x} - q(x)y_x. We prove that all the associated eigenvalues \(\la_n\)_{n\geq1} are algebraically simple, furthermore the corresponding eigenfunctions \(\phi_n\)_{n\geq1} satisfy \phi_n'{T}{\phi}_{n}(-1)>0 and \phi_n'{T}{\phi}_{n}(1)<0 for all n\geq1. These results give a key to the solutions of various control and stability problems related to this system.
