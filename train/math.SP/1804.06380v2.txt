Let (M,g) be a compact, Riemannian manifold and V \in C^{\infty}(M; \mathbb{R}). Given a regular energy level E > \min V, we consider L^2-normalized eigenfunctions, u_h, of the Schrodinger operator P(h) = - h^2 \Delta_g + V - E(h) with P(h) u_h = 0 and E(h) = E + o(1) as h \to 0^+. The well-known Agmon-Lithner estimates \cite{Hel} are exponential decay estimates (ie. upper bounds) for eigenfunctions in the forbidden region \{ V>E \}. The decay rate is given in terms of the Agmon distance function d_E associated with the degenerate Agmon metric (V-E)_+ \, g with support in the forbidden region.   The point of this note is to prove a partial converse to the Agmon estimates (ie. exponential {\em lower} bounds for the eigenfunctions) in terms of Agmon distance in the forbidden region under a control assumption on eigenfunction mass in the allowable region \{ V< E \} arbitrarily close to the caustic  \{ V = E \}. We then give some applications to hypersurface restriction bounds for eigenfunctions in the forbidden region along with corresponding nodal intersection estimates.
