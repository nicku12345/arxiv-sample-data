After recalling a fundamental identity relating traces and modified Fredholm determinants, we apply it to a class of half-line Schr\"odinger operators (- d^2/dx^2) + q on (0,\infty) with purely discrete spectra. Roughly speaking, the class considered is generated by potentials q that, for some fixed C_0 > 0, \varepsilon > 0, x_0 \in (0, \infty), diverge at infinity in the manner that q(x) \geq C_0 x^{(2/3) + \varepsilon_0} for all x \geq x_0. We treat all self-adjoint boundary conditions at the left endpoint 0.
