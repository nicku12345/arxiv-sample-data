We consider a Sturm-Liouville operator on a finite interval as well as a scattering problem on the real line both with transfer conditions at the origin. On a finite interval we show that the the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function can be uniquely determined from two spectra for the same equation but with varied boundary conditions at one end of the interval. In addition, we prove that the m-function can also be uniquely reconstructed from one spectrum and the corresponding norming constants. For the scattering problem on the real line we assume that the potential has compact essential support. For a given symmetric finite intervals containing the essential-support of the potential and a pair of separated boundary conditions imposed at the ends of the interval, the spectrum and corresponding norming constants can be uniquely recoverable from the scattering data on \R. Consequently the potential and transfer matrix can be determined.
