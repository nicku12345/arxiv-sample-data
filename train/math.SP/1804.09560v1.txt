Continuous movement of discrete spectrum of the Schr\"{o}dinger operator H(z)=-\frac{d^2} {dx^2}+V_0+z V_1, with \int_0^\infty {x |V_j(x)| dx} < \infty, on the half-line is studied as z moves along a continuous path in the complex plane. The analysis provides information regarding the members of the discrete spectrum of the non-selfadjoint operator that are evolved from the discrete spectrum of the corresponding selfadjoint operator.
