We study the differential equation  - (p(x) y')' + q(x) y' = \lambda y, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree at most 2 and q(x) is a polynomial of degree at most 1. This includes the classical Jacobi polynomials, Hermite polynomials, Legendre polynomials, Chebychev polynomials and Laguerre polynomials. We provide a general electrostatic interpretation of zeros of such polynomials: the set of real numbers \left\{x_1, \dots, x_n\right\} satisfies  p(x_i) \sum_{k = 1 \atop k \neq i}^{n}{\frac{2}{x_k - x_i}} = q(x_i) - p'(x_i) \qquad \mbox{for all}~ 1\leq i \leq n if and only if they are zeros of a polynomial solving the differential equation. We also derive a system of ODEs depending on p(x),q(x) whose solutions converge to the zeros of the orthogonal polynomial at an exponential rate.
