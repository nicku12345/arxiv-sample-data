In this paper we deal with circulant and partitioned into n-by-n circulant blocks matrices and introduce spectral results concerning this class of matrices. The problem of finding lists of complex numbers corresponding to a set of eigenvalues of a nonnegative block matrix with circulant blocks is treated. Along the paper we call realizable list if its elements are the eigenvalues of a nonnegative matrix. The Guo's index \lambda_0 of a realizable list is the minimum spectral radius such that the list (up to the initial spectral radius) together with \lambda_0 is realizable. The Guo's index of block circulant matrices with circulant blocks is obtained, and in consequence, necessary and sufficient conditions concerning the NIEP, Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem, for the realizability of some spectra are given.
