We proved that Schr\"odinger operators with unbounded potentials (H_{\alpha,\theta}u)_n=u_{n+1}+u_{n-1}+ \frac{g(\theta+n\alpha)}{f(\theta+n\alpha)} u_n have purely singular continuous spectrum on the set \{E: 0<L(E)<\delta{(\alpha,\theta;f,g)}\}, where \delta is an explicit function and L is the Lyapunov exponent. We only require f,g are H\"older continuous functions and f has finitely many zeros with weak non-degenerate assumptions. Moreover, we show that for generic \alpha and a.e. \theta, the spectral measure of H_{\alpha,\theta} has full spectral/packing dimension.
