The Neumann-Poincar\'e operator on the sphere has \frac{1}{2(2k+1)}, k=0,1,2,\ldots, as its eigenvalues and the corresponding multiplicity is 2k+1. We consider the bifurcation of eigenvalues under deformation of domains, and show that Frech\'et derivative of the sum of the bifurcations is zero. We then discuss the connection of this result with some conjectures regarding the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator.
