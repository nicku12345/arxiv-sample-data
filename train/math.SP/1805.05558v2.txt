In this paper, we introduce the following concept which generalizes known definitions of multiplicative and additive D-stability, Schur D-stability, H-stability, D-hyperbolicity and many others. Given a subset {\mathfrak D} \subset {\mathbb C}, a matrix class {\mathcal G} \subset {\mathcal M}^{n \times n} and a binary operation \circ on {\mathcal M}^{n \times n}, an n \times n matrix \mathbf A is called ({\mathfrak D}, {\mathcal G}, \circ)-stable if \sigma({\mathbf G}\circ {\mathbf A}) \subset {\mathfrak D} for any {\mathbf G} \in {\mathcal G}. Such an approach allows us to unite several well-known matrix problems and to consider common ways of their analysis. Here, we make a survey of existing results and open problems on different types of stability, study basic properties of ({\mathfrak D}, {\mathcal G}, \circ)-stable matrices and relations between different ({\mathfrak D}, {\mathcal G}, \circ)-stability classes.
