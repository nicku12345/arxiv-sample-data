The spectral theory of Laplacian tensor is an important tool for revealing some important properties of a hypergraph. It is meaningful to compute all Laplacian H-eigenvalues for some special k-uniform hypergraphs. For an odd-uniform loose path of length three, the Laplacian H-spectrum has been studied. However, all Laplacian H-eigenvalues of the class of loose paths have not been found out. In this paper, we compute all Laplacian H-eigenvalues for the class of loose paths. We show that the number of Laplacian H-eigenvalues of an odd(even)-uniform loose path with length three is 7(14). Some numerical results are given to show the efficiency of our method. Especially, the numerical results show that its Laplacian H-spectrum converges to \{0,1,1.5,2\} when k goes to infinity. Finally, we establish convergence analysis for a part of the conclusion and also present a conjecture.
