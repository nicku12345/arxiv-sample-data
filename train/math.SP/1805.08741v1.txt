We define here a pseudo B-Fredholm operator as an operator such that 0 is isolated in its essential spectrum, then we prove that an operator T is pseudo- B-Fredholm if and only if T = R + F where R is a Riesz operator and F is a B-Fredholm operator such that the commutator [R,\, F] is compact. Moreover, we prove that 0 is a pole of the resolvent of an operator T in the Calkin algebra if and only if T= K+F, where K is a power compact operator and F is a B-Fredholm operator, such that the commutator [K,\, F] is compact. As an application, we characterize the mean convergence in the Calkin algebra.
