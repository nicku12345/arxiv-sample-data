We show that eigenvalues of the Robin Laplacian with a positive boundary parameter \alpha on rectangles and unions of rectangtes satisfy P\'{o}lya-type inequalities, albeit with an exponent smaller than that of the corresponding Weyl asympotics for a fixed domain. We determine the optimal exponents in either case, showing that they are different in the two situations. Our approach to proving these results includes a characterisation of the corresponding extremal domains for the kth eigenvalue in regions of the (k,\alpha)-plane.
