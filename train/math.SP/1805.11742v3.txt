We consider a position-dependent quantum walk on {\bf Z}. In particular, we derive a detection method for edge defects by embedded eigenvalues of its time evolution operator. In the present paper, the set of edge defects is that of points in {\bf Z} on which the coin operator is an anti-diagonal matrix. In fact, under some suitable assumptions, the existence of a finite number of edge defects is equivalent to the existence of embedded eigenvalues of the time evolution operator.
