Let G=\left( V\left( G\right) ,E\left( G\right) \right)  be an \left( n,m\right) -graph and X a nonempty proper subset of V\left( G\right) . Let X^{c}=V\left( G\right) \backslash X.\ The edge density of X in G is given by \begin{equation*} \rho _{G}\left( X\right) =\frac{n\left\vert E_{X}\left( G\right) \right\vert }{\left\vert X\right\vert \left\vert X^{c}\right\vert }, \end{equation*} where E_{X}\left( G\right) \  is the set of edges in G with one end in % X  and the other in X^{c}. The Laplacian spread of a graph is the difference between the greatest Laplacian eigenvalue and the algebraic connectivity. In this paper, we use the edge density of some nonempty proper subsets of vertices in G to establish new lower bounds for the Laplacian spread. Also, using some known numerical inequalities some lower bounds for the Laplacian spread of a graph with a prescribed degree sequence are presented.
