The Neumann-Poincar\'e operator is a boundary-integral operator associated with harmonic layer potentials. This article proves the existence of eigenvalues within the essential spectrum for the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator for certain Lipschitz curves in the plane with reflectional symmetry, when considered in the functional space in which it is self-adjoint. The proof combines the compactness of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator for curves of class C^{2,\alpha} with the essential spectrum generated by a corner. Eigenvalues corresponding to even (odd) eigenfunctions are proved to lie within the essential spectrum of the odd (even) component of the operator when a C^{2,\alpha} curve is perturbed by inserting a small corner.
