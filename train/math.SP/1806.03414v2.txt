In this paper we study operators originated from semi-B-Fredholm theory and as a consequence we get some results regarding boundaries and connected hulls of the corresponding spectra. In particular, we prove that a bounded linear operator T acting on a Banach space, having topological uniform descent, is a {\bf BR} operator if and only if 0 is not an accumulation point of the associated spectrum \sigma_{\bf R}(T)=\{\lambda\in\CC:T-\lambda I\notin {\bf R}\}, where {\bf R} denote any of the following classes: upper semi-Weyl operators, Weyl operators, upper semi-Fredholm operators, Fredholm operators, operators with finite (essential) descent and {\bf BR} the B-regularity associated to {\bf R} as in \cite{P8}. Under the stronger hypothesis of quasi-Fredholmness of T, we obtain a similar characterization for T being a {\bf BR} operator for much larger families of sets {\bf R}.
