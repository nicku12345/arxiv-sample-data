In this paper, partial inverse problems for the quadratic pencil of Sturm-Liouville operators on a graph with a loop were studied. These problems consist in recovering the pencil coefficients on one edge of the graph (a boundary edge or the loop) from spectral characteristics, while the coefficients on the other edges are known a priori. We obtain uniqueness theorems and constructive solutions for the partial inverse problems.
