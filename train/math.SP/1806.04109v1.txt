We use the method of similar operators to study a mixed problem for a differential equation with an involution and an operator-valued potential function. The differential operator defined by the equation is transformed into a similar operator that is an orthogonal direct sum of simpler operators. The result is used to construct an operator group that describes the mild solutions of the original problem. It may also serve as a justification for the use of the Fourier method to solve it.
