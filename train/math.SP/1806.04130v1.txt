We study extensions of direct sums of symmetric operators S=\oplus_{n\in\mathbb{N}} S_n. In general there is no natural boundary triplet for S^* even if there is one for every S_n^*, n\in\mathbb{N}. We consider a subclass of extensions of S which can be described in terms of the boundary triplets of S_n^* and investigate the self-adjointness, the semi-boundedness from below and the discreteness of the spectrum. Sufficient conditions for these properties are obtained from recent results on weighted discrete Laplacians. The results are applied to Dirac operators on metric graphs with point interactions at the vertices. In particular, we allow graphs with arbitrarily small edge length.
