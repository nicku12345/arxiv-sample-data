The total graph of G, \mathcal T(G) is the graph whose set of vertices is the union of the sets of vertices and edges of G, where two vertices are adjacent if and only if they stand for either incident or adjacent elements in G. Let \mathcal{T}^1(G)=\mathcal{T}(G), the total graph of G. For k\geq2, the k\text{-}th iterated total graph of G, \mathcal{T}^k(G), is defined recursively as \mathcal{T}^k(G)=\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{T}^{k-1}(G)). If G is a connected graph its diameter is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices in G. The incidence energy IE(G) of G is the sum of the singular values of the incidence matrix of G. In this paper for a given integer k we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which diam(\mathcal{T}^{r+1}(G))>k-r, r\geq0. In addition, bounds for the incidence energy of the iterated graph \mathcal{T}^{r+1}(G) are obtained, provided G to be a regular graph. Finally, new families of non-isomorphic cospectral graphs are exhibited.
