This article concerns the number of nodal domains of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on special Riemannian 3-manifolds, namely nontrivial principal S^1 bundles P \to X over Riemann surfaces equipped with certain S^1 invariant metrics, the Kaluza-Klein metrics. We prove for generic Kaluza-Klein metrics that any Laplacian eigenfunction has exactly two nodal domains unless it is invariant under the S^1 action.   We also construct an explicit orthonormal eigenbasis on the flat 3-torus \mathbb{T}^3 for which every non-constant eigenfunction belonging to the basis has two nodal domains.
