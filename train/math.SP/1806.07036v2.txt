In this work, the real nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem is solved for a particular class of permutative matrix. The necessary and sufficient condition there is also shown to be sufficient for the symmetric nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem. A result due to Johnson and Paparella [MR3452738, Linear Algebra Appl. 493 (2016), 281--300] is extended to include normalized lists that satisfy the new sufficient condition.
