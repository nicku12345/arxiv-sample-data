Given an Anosov vector field X_0, all sufficiently close vector fields also are of Anosov type. In this note, we check that one can choose the so-called "Faure-Sj\"ostrand" anistropic spaces to be adapted to any smooth vector field sufficiently close to X_0 in C^1 norm. It follows that finite families of resonances depend smoothly on the vector field with the usual caveats.   In this second version, more details are given on the perturbation of spectral projectors.
