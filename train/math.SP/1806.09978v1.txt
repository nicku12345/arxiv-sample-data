A permutative matrix is a square matrix such that every row is a permutation of the first row. A circulant matrix is a matrix where each row is a cyclic shift of the row above to the right. The Guo's index \lambda_0 of a realizable list is the minimum spectral radius such that the list (up to the initial spectral radius) together with \lambda_0 is realizable. The Guo's index of some permutative matrices is obtained. Our results are constructive. Some examples designed using MATLAB are given at the end of the paper.
