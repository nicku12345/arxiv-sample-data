We use the method of similar operators to study a general Dirac operator L and its spectral properties. We find a similar operator to the Dirac operator that is an orthogonal direct sum of simpler operators. The result is used to describe an operator group generated by the operator iL and study its properties such as the asymptotics of the spectrum.
