In this paper we explore some results concerning the spread of the line and the total graph of a given graph. In particular, it is proved that for an (n,m) connected graph G with m > n \geq 4 the spread of G is less than or equal to the spread of its line graph, where the equality holds if and only if G is regular bipartite. A sufficient condition for the spread of the graph not be greater than the signless Laplacian spread for a class of non bipartite and non regular graphs is proved. Additionally, we derive an upper bound for the spread of the line graph of graphs on n vertices having a vertex (edge) connectivity less than or equal to a positive integer k. Combining techniques of interlacing of eigenvalues, we derive lower bounds for the Laplacian and signless Laplacian spread of the total graph of a connected graph. Moreover, for a regular graph, an upper and lower bound for the spread of its total graph is given.
