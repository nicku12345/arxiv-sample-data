In this paper, we determine the two normalized Laplacian spectrum of generalized subdivision- vertex corona, subdivision-edge corona for a connected regular graph with an arbitrary reg- ular graph in terms of their normalized Laplacian eigenvalues. Moreover, applying these results, we find some non-regular normaliaed Laplacian cospectral graphs. These results generalize the existing results in [11].
