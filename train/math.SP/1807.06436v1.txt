We propose a Nordhaus-Gaddum conjecture for q(G), the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix corresponding to a graph G: for every graph G excluding four exceptions, we conjecture that q(G)+q(G^c)\le |G|+2, where G^c is the complement of G. We compute q(G^c) for all trees and all graphs G with q(G)=|G|-1, and hence we verify the conjecture for trees, unicyclic graphs, graphs with q(G)\le 4, and for graphs with |G|\le 7.
