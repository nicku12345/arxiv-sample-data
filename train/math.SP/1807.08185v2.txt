We establish a sharp lower bound on the first non-trivial eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a metric graph equipped with natural (i.e., continuity and Kirchhoff) vertex conditions in terms of the diameter and the total length of the graph. This extends a result of, and resolves an open problem from, [J. B. Kennedy, P. Kurasov, G. Malenov\'a and D. Mugnolo, Ann. Henri Poincar\'e 17 (2016), 2439--2473, Section 7.2], and also complements an analogous lower bound for the corresponding eigenvalue of the combinatorial Laplacian on a discrete graph. We also give a family of corresponding lower bounds for the higher eigenvalues under the assumption that the total length of the graph is sufficiently large compared with its diameter. These inequalities are sharp in the case of trees.
