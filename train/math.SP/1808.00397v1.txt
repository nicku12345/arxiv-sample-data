In this paper, we show that the analytic and geometric multiplicities of an eigenvalue of a class of singular linear Hamiltonian systems are equal, where both endpoints are in the limit circle cases. The proof is fundamental and is given for both continuous and discrete Hamiltonian systems. The method used in this paper also works for both endpoints are regular, or one endpoint is regular and the other is in the limit circle case.
