We show that the set of n \times n complex symmetric matrix pencils of rank at most r is the union of the closures of \lfloor r/2\rfloor +1 sets of matrix pencils with some, explicitly described, complete eigenstructures. As a consequence, these are the generic complete eigenstructures of n \times n complex symmetric matrix pencils of rank at most r. We also show that these closures correspond to the irreducible components of the set of n\times n symmetric matrix pencils with rank at most r when considered as an algebraic set.
