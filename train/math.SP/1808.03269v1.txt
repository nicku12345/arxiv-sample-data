We establish sharp pointwise estimates for the ground states of some singular fractional Schr\"odinger operators on relatively compact Euclidean subsets. The considered operators are of the type (-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}|_\Omega-V, where V\in L^1_{Loc} and (-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}|_\Omega is the fractional-Laplacian on an open subset \Omega in \mathbb{R}^d with zero exterior condition . The intrinsic ultracontractivity property for such operators is discussed as well and a sharp large time asymptotic for their heat kernels is derived.
