Here we show that for Schr\"{o}dinger operator with decaying random potential with fat tail single site distribution, the negative spectrum shows a transition from essential spectrum to discrete spectrum. We study the Schr\"{o}dinger operator H^\omega=-\Delta+\displaystyle\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^d}a_n\omega_n\chi_{_{(0,1]^d}}(x-n) on L^2(\mathbb{R}^d). Here we take a_n=O(|n|^{-\alpha}) for large n where \alpha>0, and \{\omega_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^d} are i.i.d real random variables with absolutely continuous distribution \mu such that \frac{d\mu}{dx}(x)=O\big(|x|^{-(1+\delta)}\big)~as~|x|\to\infty, for some \delta>0. We show that H^\omega exhibits exponential localization on negative part of spectrum independent of the parameters chosen. For \alpha\delta\leq d we show that the spectrum is entire real line almost surely, but for \alpha\delta>d we have \sigma_{ess}(H^\omega)=[0,\infty) and negative part of the spectrum is discrete almost surely. In some cases we show the existence of the absolutely continuous spectrum.
