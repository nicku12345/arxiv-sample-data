We study the limiting behavior of the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalue counting function of generalized second order differential operators \frac{d}{d \mu} \frac{d}{d x}, where \mu is a finite atomless Borel measure on some compact interval [a,b]. Therefore, we firstly recall the results of the spectral asymptotics for these operators received so far. Afterwards, we make a proposition about the convergence behavior for so called random V-variable Cantor measures.
