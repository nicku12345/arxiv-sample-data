We give a relativistic generalization of the Gutzwiller-Duistermaat-Guillemin trace formula for the wave group of a compact Riemannian manifold to globally hyperbolic stationary space-times with compact Cauchy hypersurfaces. We introduce several (essentially equivalent) notions of trace of self-adjoint operators on the null-space \ker \Box of the wave operator and define U(t) to be translation by the flow e^{t Z} of the timelike Killing vector field Z on \Box. The spectrum of Z on \ker \Box is discrete and the singularities of \rm{Tr}\;e^{t Z} |_{\ker \Box} occur at periods of periodic orbits of \exp t Z on the symplectic manifold of null geodesics. The trace formula gives a Weyl law for the eigenvalues of Z on \ker \Box.
