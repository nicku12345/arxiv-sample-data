For certain spectral parameters we find explicit eigenfunctions of transfer operators for Schottky surfaces. Comparing the dimension of the eigenspace for the spectral parameter zero with the multiplicity of topological zeros of the Selberg zeta function, we deduce that zero is a resonance of every Schottky surface.
