The main focus of this paper is the following matrix Cauchy problem for the Dirac system on the interval [0,1]: \[ D'(x)+\left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \sigma_1(x)\\ \sigma_2(x) & 0 \end{array} \right] D(x)=i\mu\left[\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0\\ 0 &-1 \end{array} \right]D(x),\quad D(0)=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1 \end{array}\right], \] where \mu\in\mathbb{C} is a spectral parameter, and \sigma_j\in L_2[0,1], j=1,2. We propose a new approach for the study of asymptotic behaviour of its solutions as \mu\to \infty and |{\rm Im}\,\mu|\le d. As an application, we obtain new, sharp asymptotic formulas for eigenfunctions of Sturm-Liouville operators with singular potentials.
