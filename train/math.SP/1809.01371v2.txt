We consider a Sturm-Liouville operator a with integrable potential q on the unit interval I=[0,1]. We consider a Schr\"odinger operator with a real compactly supported potential on the half line and on the line, where this potential coincides with q on the unit interval and vanishes outside I. We determine the relationships between eigenvalues of such operators and obtain estimates of eigenvalues in terms of potentials.
