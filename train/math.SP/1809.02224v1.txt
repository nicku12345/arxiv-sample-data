A list \Lambda =\{\lambda _{1},\lambda_{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{n}\} of complex numbers is said to be realizable if it is the spectrum of an entrywise nonnegative matrix. The list \Lambda  is said to be universally realizable (\mathcal{UR}) if it is the spectrum of a nonnegative matrix for each possible Jordan canonical form allowed by \Lambda . It is well known that an n\times n nonnegative matrix A is co-spectral to a nonnegative matrix B with constant row sums. In this paper, we extend the co-spectrality between A and B to a similarity between A and B, when the Perron eigenvalue is simple. We also show that if \epsilon \geq 0 and \Lambda =\{\lambda _{1},\lambda_{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{n}\} is \mathcal{UR}, then \{\lambda _{1}+\epsilon ,\lambda _{2},\ldots,\lambda _{n}\} is also \mathcal{UR}. We give counter-examples for the cases: \Lambda =\{\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{n}\} is \mathcal{UR} implies \{\lambda _{1}+\epsilon ,\lambda _{2}-\epsilon ,\lambda_{3},\ldots ,\lambda_{n}\} is \mathcal{UR}, and \Lambda _{1},\Lambda _{2} are \mathcal{UR} implies \Lambda _{1}\cup \Lambda _{2} is \mathcal{UR}.
