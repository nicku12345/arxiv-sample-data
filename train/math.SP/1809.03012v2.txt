We consider the Schr\"odinger operator \[ P=h^2 \Delta_g + V \] on \mathbb{R}^n equipped with a metric g that is Euclidean outside a compact set. The real-valued potential V is assumed to be compactly supported and smooth except at conormal singularities of order -1-\alpha along a compact hypersurface Y. For \alpha>2 (or even \alpha>1 if the classical flow is unique), we show that if E_0 is a non-trapping energy for the classical flow, then the operator P has no resonances in a region \[   [E_0 - \delta, E_0 + \delta] - i[0,\nu_0 h \log(1/h)].   \] The constant \nu_0 is explicit in terms of \alpha and dynamical quantities. We also show that the size of this resonance-free region is optimal for the class of piecewise-smooth potentials on the line.
