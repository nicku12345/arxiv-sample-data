The paper presents an explicit form of the resolvent for the class of generators of C_0-groups with purely imaginary eigenvalues, clustering at i\infty, and complete minimal non-basis family of eigenvectors, constructed recently by the authors in~\cite{Sklyar3}. The growth properties of the resolvent are described. The discrete Hardy inequality serves as the cornerstone for the proofs of the corresponding results. Moreover, it is shown that the main result on the Riesz basis property for invariant subspaces of the generator of the C_0-group, obtained a decade ago by G.Q.~Xu, S.P.~Yung and H.~Zwart in~\cite{Xu},~\cite{Zwart}, is sharp.
