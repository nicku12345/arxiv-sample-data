Let M be a compact boundaryless Riemannian manifold, carrying an effective and isometric action of a torus T, and P_0 an invariant elliptic classical pseudodifferential operator on M. In this note, we strengthen asymptotics for the equivariant (or reduced) spectral function of P_0 derived previously, which are already sharp in the eigenvalue aspect, to become almost sharp in the isotypic aspect. In particular, this leads to hybrid equivariant L^p-bounds for eigenfunctions that are almost sharp in the eigenvalue and isotypic aspect.
