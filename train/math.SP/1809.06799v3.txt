We consider Toeplitz operators associated with the renormalized Bochner-Laplacian on high tensor powers of a positive line bundle on a compact symplectic manifold. We study the asymptotic behavior, in the semiclassical limit, of low-lying eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of a self-adjoint Toeplitz operator under assumption that its principal symbol has a non-degenerate minimum with discrete wells. As an application, we prove upper bounds for low-lying eigenvalues of the Bochner-Laplacian in the semiclassical limit.
