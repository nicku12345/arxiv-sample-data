This paper is dedicated to the classical Hadamard formula for asymptotics of eigenvalues of the Dirichlet-Laplacian under perturbations of the boundary. We prove that the Hadamard formula still holds for C^1-domains with C^1-perturbations. We also derive an optimal estimate for the remainder term in the C^{1,\alpha}-case. Furthermore, if the boundary is merely Lipschitz, we show that the Hadamard formula is not valid.
