We describe a new approach to understanding averages of high energy Laplace eigenfunctions, u_h, over submanifolds,  \Big|\int _H u_hd\sigma_H\Big|  where H\subset M is a submanifold and \sigma_H the induced by the Riemannian metric on M. This approach can be applied uniformly to submanifolds of codimension 1\leq k\leq n and in particular, gives a new approach to understanding \|u_h\|_{L^\infty(M)}. The method, developed in the author's recent work together with Y. Canzani and J. Toth, relies on estimating averages by the behavior of u_h microlocally near the conormal bundle to H. By doing this, we are able to obtain quantitative improvements on eigenfunction averages under certain uniform non-recurrent conditions on the conormal directions to H. In particular, we do not require any global assumptions on the manifold (M,g).
