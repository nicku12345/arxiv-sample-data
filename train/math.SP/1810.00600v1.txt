We consider a class of maps from integral Hankel operators to Hankel matrices, which we call restriction maps. In the simplest case, such a map is simply a restriction of the integral kernel onto integers. More generally, it is given by an averaging of the kernel with a sufficiently regular weight function. We study the boundedness of restriction maps with respect to the operator norm and the Schatten norms.
