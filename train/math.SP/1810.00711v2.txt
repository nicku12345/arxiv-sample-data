Given two compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary M_1 and M_2 such that their respective boundaries \Sigma_1 and \Sigma_2 admit neighborhoods \Omega_1 and \Omega_2 which are isometric, we prove the existence of a constant C, which depends only on the geometry of \Omega_1\cong\Omega_2, such that |\sigma_k(M_1)-\sigma_k(M_2)|\leq C for each k\in\mathbb{N}. This follows from a quantitative relationship between the Steklov eigenvalues \sigma_k of a compact Riemannian manifold M and the eigenvalues \lambda_k of the Laplacian on its boundary. Our main result states that the difference |\sigma_k-\sqrt{\lambda_k}| is bounded above by a constant which depends on the geometry of M only in a neighborhood of its boundary. The proofs are based on a Pohozaev identity and on comparison geometry for principal curvatures of parallel hypersurfaces. In several situations, the constant C is given explicitly in terms of bounds on the geometry of \Omega_1\cong\Omega_2.
