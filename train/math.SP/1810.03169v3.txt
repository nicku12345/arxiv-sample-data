We show for a certain class of operators A and holomorphic functions f that the functional calculus A\mapsto f(A) is holomorphic. Using this result we are able to prove that fractional Laplacians (1+\Delta^g)^p depend real analytically on the metric g in suitable Sobolev topologies. As an application we obtain local well-posedness of the geodesic equation for fractional Sobolev metrics on the space of all Riemannian metrics.
