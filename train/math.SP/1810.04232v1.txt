Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold and P_1:=-h^2\Delta_g+V(x)-E_1 so that dp_1\neq 0 on p_1=0. We assume that P_1 is quantum completely integrable in the sense that there exist functionally independent pseuodifferential operators P_2,\dots P_n with [P_i,P_j]=0, i,j=1,\dots ,n. We study the pointwise bounds for the joint eigenfunctions, u_h of the system \{P_i\}_{i=1}^n with P_1u_h=E_1u_h+o(1). We first give polynomial improvements over the standard H\"ormander bounds for typical points in M. In two and three dimensions, these estimates agree with the Hardy exponent h^{-\frac{1-n}{4}} and in higher dimensions we obtain a gain of h^{\frac{1}{2}} over the H\"ormander bound.   In our second main result, under a real-analyticity assumption on the QCI system, we give exponential decay estimates for joint eigenfunctions at points outside the projection of invariant Lagrangian tori; that is at points x\in M in the "microlocally forbidden" region p_1^{-1}(E_1)\cap \dots \cap p_n^{-1}(E_n)\cap T^*_xM=\emptyset. These bounds are sharp locally near the projection of the invariant tori.
