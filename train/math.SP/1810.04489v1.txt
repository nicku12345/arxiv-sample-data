Let \Gamma_{w} be a non-cofinite Hecke triangle group with cusp width w>2 and let \varrho\colon\Gamma_w\to U(V) be a finite-dimensional unitary representation of \Gamma_w. In this note we announce a new fractal upper bound for the Selberg zeta function of \Gamma_{w} twisted by \varrho. In strips parallel to the imaginary axis and bounded away from the real axis, the Selberg zeta function is bounded by \exp\left( C_{\varepsilon} \vert s\vert^{\delta + \varepsilon} \right), where \delta = \delta_{w} denotes the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of \Gamma_{w}. This bound implies fractal Weyl bounds on the resonances of the Laplacian for all geometrically finite surfaces X=\widetilde{\Gamma}\backslash\mathbb{H} where \widetilde{\Gamma} is a finite index, torsion-free subgroup of \Gamma_w.
