In this paper, we investigate the Tomas-Stein restriction estimates on convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds \Gamma\backslash\mathbb{H}^{n+1}. Via the spectral measure of the Laplacian, we prove that the Tomas-Stein restriction estimate holds when the limit set has Hausdorff dimension \delta_\Gamma<n/2. This provides an example for which restriction estimate holds in the presence of hyperbolic geodesic trapping.
