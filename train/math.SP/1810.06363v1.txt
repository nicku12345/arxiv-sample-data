We study the 1-D Schr\"odinger operators in Hilbert space L^{2}(\mathbb{R}) with real-valued Radon measure q'(x), q\in \mathrm{BV}_{loc}(\mathbb{R}) as potentials. New sufficient conditions for minimal operators to be bounded below and selfadjoint are found. For such operators a criterion for the discreteness of the spectrum is proved, which generalizes Molchanov's, Brinck's, and the Albeverio-Kostenko-Malamud criteria. The quadratic forms corresponding to the investigated operators are described.
