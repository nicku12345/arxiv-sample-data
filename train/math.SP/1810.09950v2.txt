We consider the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on an open, bounded, connected set in \mathbb{R}^n with C^2 boundary, with a Neumann boundary condition or a Robin boundary condition. We obtain upper bounds for those eigenvalues that have a corresponding eigenfunction which achieves equality in Courant's Nodal Domain theorem. In the case where the set is also assumed to be convex, we obtain explicit upper bounds in terms of some of the geometric quantities of the set.
