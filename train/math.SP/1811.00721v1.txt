This paper discusses resonance effects to advance a classical earthquake model, namely the celebrated M8 global test algorithm. This algorithmgives high confidence levels for prediction of Time Intervals of Increased Probability (TIP) of an earthquake. It is based on observation that almost 80\% of earthquakes occur due to the stress accumulated from previous earthquakes at the location and stored in form of displacements against gravity and static elastic deformations of the plates. Nevertheless the M8 global test algorithm fails to predict some powerful earthquakes. In this paper we suggest the additional possibility of considering the dynamical storage of the elastic energy on the tectonic plates due to resonance beats of seismo-gravitational oscillations (SGO) modes of the plates. We make sure that the tangential compression in the middle plane of an "active zone" of a tectonic plate may tune its SGO modes to the resonance condition of coincidence the frequencies of the corresponding localized modes with the delocalized SGO modes of the complement. We also consider the beats arising between the modes under a small perturbations of the plates, and, assuming that the discord between the perturbed and unperturbed resonance modes is strongly dominated by the discord between the non-resonance modes estimate the energy transfer coefficient.
