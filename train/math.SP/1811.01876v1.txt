Let (T(t))_{t\geq 0} be a C_0 semigroup on a Banach space X with infinitesimal generator A. In this work, we give conditions for which the spectral mapping theorem \sigma_{*}(T(t))\backslash \{0\}=\{e^{\lambda s}, \lambda\in\sigma_{*}(A)\} holds, where \sigma_* can be equal to the essential, Browder and Kato spectrum. Also, we will be interested in the relations between the spectrum of A and the spectrum of the nth derivative T(t)^{(n)} of a differentiable C_0 semigroup (T(t))_{t\geq0}.
