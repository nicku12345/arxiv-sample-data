In this paper, we study the unbounded upper triangular operator matrix with diagonal domain. Some sufficient and necessary conditions are given under which upper semi-Weyl spectrum (resp. upper semi-Browder spectrum) of such operator matrix is equal to the union of the upper semi-Weyl spectra (resp. the upper semi-Browder spectra) of its diagonal entries. As an application, the corresponding spectral properties of Hamiltonian operator matrix are obtained.
