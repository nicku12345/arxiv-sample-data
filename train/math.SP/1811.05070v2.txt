We investigate the decay property of the eigenvalues of the Neumann-Poincar\'{e} operator in two dimensions. As is well-known, this operator admits only a sequence of eigenvalues that accumulates to zero as its spectrum for a bounded domain having C^{1,\alpha} boundary with \alpha\in (0,1). In this paper, we show that the eigenvalue \lambda_k's of the Neumann-Poincar\'{e} operator ordered by size satisfy that |\lambda_k| = O(k^{-p-\alpha+1/2}) for an arbitrary simply connected domain having C^{1+p,\alpha} boundary with p\geq 0,~ \alpha\in(0,1) and p+\alpha>\frac{1}{2}.
