Oscillation theory locates the spectrum of a differential equation by counting the zeros of its solutions. We present a version of this theory for canonical systems Ju'=-zHu and then use it to discuss semibounded operators from this point of view. Our main new result is a characterization of systems with purely discrete spectrum in terms of the asymptotics of their coefficient functions; we also discuss the exponential types of the transfer matrices.
