We show that a factor M is full if and only if the C^*-algebra generated by its left and right regular representations contains the compact operators. We prove that the bicentralizer flow of a type \mathrm{III}_1 factor is always ergodic. As a consequence, for any type \mathrm{III}_1 factor M and any \lambda \in ]0,1], there exists an irreducible AFD type \mathrm{III}_\lambda subfactor with expectation in M. Moreover, any type \mathrm{III}_1 factor M which satisfies M \cong M \otimes R_\lambda for some \lambda \in ]0,1[ has trivial bicentralizer. Finally, we give a counter-example to the characterization of approximately inner automorphisms conjectured by Connes and we prove a weaker version of this conjecture. In particular, we obtain a new proof of Kawahigashi-Sutherland-Takesaki's result that every automorphism of the AFD type \mathrm{III}_1 factor is approximately inner.
