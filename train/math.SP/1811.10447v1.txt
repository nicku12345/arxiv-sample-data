We consider Laplacian eigenfunctions on a d-dimensional bounded domain M (or a d-dimensional compact manifold M) with Dirichlet conditions. These operators give rise to a sequence of eigenfunctions (e_\ell)_{\ell \in \mathbb{N}}. We study the subspace of all pointwise products  A_n = \mbox{span} \left\{ e_i(x) e_j(x): 1 \leq i,j \leq n\right\} \subseteq L^2(M). Clearly, that vector space has dimension \mbox{dim}(A_n) = n(n+1)/2. We prove that products e_i e_j of eigenfunctions are simple in a certain sense: for any \varepsilon > 0, there exists a low-dimensional vector space B_n that almost contains all products. More precisely, denoting the orthogonal projection \Pi_{B_n}:L^2(M) \rightarrow B_n, we have  \forall~1 \leq i,j \leq n~ \qquad \|e_ie_j - \Pi_{B_n}( e_i e_j) \|_{L^2} \leq \varepsilon and the size of the space \mbox{dim}(B_n) is relatively small: for every \delta > 0,  \mbox{dim}(B_n) \lesssim_{M,\delta} \varepsilon^{-\delta} n^{1+\delta}. We obtain the same sort of bounds for products of arbitrary length, as well for approximation in H^{-1} norm. Pointwise products of eigenfunctions are low-rank. This has implications, among other things, for the validity of fast algorithms in electronic structure computations.
