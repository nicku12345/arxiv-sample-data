Given a smooth compact hypersurface M with boundary \Sigma=\partial M, we prove the existence of a sequence M_j of hypersurfaces with the same boundary as M, such that each Steklov eigenvalue \sigma_k(M_j) tends to zero as j tends to infinity. The hypersurfaces M_j are obtained from M by a local perturbation near a point of its boundary. Their volumes and diameters are arbitrarily close to those of M, while the principal curvatures of the boundary remain unchanged.
