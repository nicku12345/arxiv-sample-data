In theory and practice of inverse problems, linear operator equations Tx=y with compact linear forward operators T having a non-closed range \mathcal{R}(T) and mapping between infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces plays some prominent role. As a consequence of the ill-posedness of such problems, regularization approaches are required, and due to its unlimited qualification spectral cut-off is an appropriate method for the stable approximate solution of corresponding inverse problems. For this method, however, the singular system \{\sigma_i(T),u_i(T),v_i(T)\}_{i=1}^\infty of the compact operator T is needed, at least for i=1,2,...,N, up to some stopping index N. In this note we consider n-fold integration operators T=J^n\;(n=1,2,...) in L^2([0,1]) occurring in numerous applications, where the solution of the associated operator equation is characterized by the n-th generalized derivative x=y^{(n)} of the Sobolev space function y \in H^n([0,1]). Almost all textbooks on linear inverse problems present the whole singular system \{\sigma_i(J^1),u_i(J^1),v_i(J^1)\}_{i=1}^\infty in an explicit manner. However, they do not discuss the singular systems for J^n,\;n \ge 2. We will emphasize that this seems to be a consequence of the fact that for higher n the eigenvalues \sigma^2_i(J^n) of the associated ODE boundary value problems obey transcendental equations, the complexity of which is growing with n. We present the transcendental equations for n=2,3,... and discuss and illustrate the associated eigenfunctions and some of their properties.
