Let G be a graph on n vertices and \lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \ldots \geq \lambda_n its eigenvalues. The Estrada index of G is defined as EE(G)=\sum_{i=1}^n e^{\lambda_i}. In this work, we using an increasing sequence converging to the \lambda_1 to obtain an increasing sequence of lower bounds for EE(G). In addition, we generalize this succession for the Estrada index of an arbitrary nonnegative Hermitian matrix.
