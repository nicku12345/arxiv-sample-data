Let A be a square complex matrix, z_1, ..., z_{n}\in\mathbb C be (possibly repetitive) points of interpolation, f be analytic in a neighborhood of the convex hull of the union of the spectrum of A and the points z_1, ..., z_{n}, and p be the interpolation polynomial of f, constructed by the points z_1, ..., z_{n}. It is proved that under these assumptions \Vert f(A)-p(A)\Vert\le\frac1{n!} \max_{t\in[0,1];\,\mu\in\text{co}\{z_1,z_{2},\dots,z_{n}\}}\bigl\Vert\Omega(A)f^{{(n)}} \bigl((1-t)\mu\mathbf1+tA\bigr)\bigr\Vert, where \Omega(z)=\prod_{k=1}^n(z-z_k).
