This paper studies trace class perturbation of closed linear relations in Hilbert spaces. The concept of trace class perturbation of closed relations is introduced by orthogonal projections. Equivalent characterizations of compact and trace class block operator matrices are first given in terms of their elements, separately. By using them, several equivalent and sufficient characterizations of trace class perturbation of closed linear relations are obtained.
