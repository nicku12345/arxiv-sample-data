We prove sufficient conditions for Hausdorff convergence of the spectra of sequences of closed operators defined on varying Hilbert spaces and converging in norm-resolvent sense, i.e. \|J_\varepsilon(1+A_\varepsilon)^{-1} - (1+A)^{-1}J_\varepsilon\|\to 0 as \varepsilon\to 0, where J_\varepsilon is a suitable identification operator between the domains of the operators. This is an extension of results of [Mugnolo-Nittka-Post(2013)], who proved absence of spectral pollution for sectorial operators.
