For a given complex square matrix A with constant row sum, we establish two new eigenvalue inclusion sets. Using these bounds, first we derive bounds for the second largest and smallest eigenvalues of adjacency matrices of k-regular graphs. Then, we establish some bounds for the second largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the normalized adjacency matrices of graphs and the second smallest eigenvalue and the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrices of graphs. Sharpness of these bounds are verified by examples.
