For all sufficiently large complex \rho, and for arbitrary matrix dimension n, it is shown that the Kac--Murdock--Szeg\H{o} matrix K_n(\rho)=\left[\rho^{|j-k|}\right]_{j,k=1}^{n} possesses exactly two eigenvalues whose magnitude is larger than n. We discuss a number of properties of the two "extraordinary" eigenvalues. Conditions are developed that, given n, allow us-without actually computing eigenvalues-to find all values \rho that give rise to eigenvalues of magnitude n, termed "borderline" eigenvalues. The aforementioned values of \rho form two closed curves in the complex-\rho plane. We describe these curves, which are n-dependent, in detail. An interesting borderline case arises when an eigenvalue of K_n(\rho) equals -n: apart from certain exceptional cases, this occurs if and only if the eigenvalue is a double one; and if and only if the point \rho is a cusp-like singularity of one of the two closed curves.
