In this paper we give a various conditions for which the tuple \mathcal{T} = (T_{1} , T_{2} , ... , T_{n}) of commutative bounded linear operators on an infinite dimensional ( real , complex ) Banach space X is orbit reflexive. After we introduce the notion of weak orbit reflexive operator and we show some results.
