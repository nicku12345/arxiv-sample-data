This paper is devoted to the determination of the cases where there is equality in Courant's nodal domain theorem in the case of a Robin boundary condition. For the square, we partially extend the results that were obtained by Pleijel, B\'erard--Helffer, Helffer--Persson--Sundqvist for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems.   After proving some general results that hold for any value of the Robin parameter h, we focus on the case when h is large. We hope to come back to the analysis when h is small in a second paper.   We also obtain some semi-stability results for the number of nodal domains of a Robin eigenfunction of a domain with C^{2,\alpha} boundary (\alpha >0) as h large varies.
