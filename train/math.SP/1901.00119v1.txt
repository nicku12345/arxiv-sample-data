This paper deals with the inverse spectral problem for a non-self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville operator with discontinuous conditions inside the interval. We obtain that if the potential q is known a priori on a subinterval  \left[ b,\pi \right]  with b\in \left( d,\pi \right]  or b=d, then h, \beta , \gamma \ and q on \left[ 0,\pi \right] \ can be uniquely determined by partial spectral data consisting of a sequence of eigenvalues and a subsequence of the corresponding generalized normalizing constants or a subsequence of the pairs of eigenvalues and the corresponding generalized ratios. For the case b\in \left( 0,d\right) , a similar statement holds if  \beta , \gamma \ are also known a priori. Moreover, if q satisfies a local smoothness condition, we provide an alternative approach instead of using the high-energy asymptotic expansion of the Weyl m-function to solve the problem of missing eigenvalues and norming constants.
