We study the eigenvalues of the Kohn Laplacian on a closed embedded strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold as functionals on the set of positive oriented contact forms \mathcal{P}_+. We show that the functionals are continuous with respect to a natural topology on \mathcal{P}_+. Using a simple adaptation of the standard Kato-Rellich perturbation theory, we prove that the functionals are (one-sided) differentiable along 1-parameter analytic deformations. We use this differentiability to define the notion of critical contact forms, in a generalized sense, for the functionals. We give a necessary (also sufficient in some situations) condition for a contact form to be critical. Finally, we present explicit examples of critical contact form on both homogeneous and non-homogeneous CR manifolds.
