The Estrada topological index EE, based on the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix, is degenerate for cospectral graphs. By additionally considering the eigenvectors, two new topological indices are devised (RV_a and RV_b), which have reduced degeneracy for alkanes or cyclic graphs. Index RV_a shows similarity to EE in ordering of alkanes with 8 to 10 carbon atoms, whereas index RV_b is more similar to the average distance-based connectivity (Balaban index J). Inter-correlations between these four topological indices are discussed, indicating which factors have predominant influence.
