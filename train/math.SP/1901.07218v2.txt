We study the convergence of 1D Schr\"odinger ope\-rators H_\varepsilon with the potentials which are regularizations of a class of pseudo-potentials having in particular the form  \alpha \delta'(x)+\beta \delta(x)+\gamma/|x|\quad\text{or}\quad \alpha \delta'(x)+\beta \delta(x)+\gamma/x.  The limit behaviour of H_\varepsilon in the norm resolvent topology, as \varepsilon\to 0, essentially depends on a way of regularization of the Coulomb potential and the existence of zero-energy resonances for \delta'-like potential. All possible limits are described in terms of point interactions at the origin. As a consequence of the convergence results, different kinds of L^\infty(\mathbb{R})-approximations to the even and odd Coulomb potentials, both penetrable and impenetrable in the limit, are constructed.
