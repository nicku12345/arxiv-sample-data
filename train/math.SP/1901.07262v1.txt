We provide an example of a normalized L^{2}(\mathbb R) function u such that its Wigner distribution \mathcal W(u,u) has an integral >1 on the square [0,a]\times[0,a] for a suitable choice of a. This provides a negative answer to a question raised by P. Flandrin in 1988. Our arguments are based upon the study of the Weyl quantization of the indicatrix of {\mathbb R_{+}\times\mathbb R_{+}} along with a precise numerical analysis of its discretization.
