The article [HPS] established a monotonicity inequality for the Helmholtz equation and presented applications to shape detection and local uniqueness in inverse boundary problems. The monotonicity inequality states that if two scattering coefficients satisfy q_1 \leq q_2, then the corresponding Neumann-to-Dirichlet operators satisfy \Lambda(q_1) \leq \Lambda(q_2) up to a finite dimensional subspace. Here we improve the bounds for the dimension of this space. In particular, if q_1 and q_2 have the same number of positive Neumann eigenvalues, then the finite dimensional space is trivial.
