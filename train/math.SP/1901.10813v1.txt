We consider an inverse problem for Laplacians on rotationally symmetric manifolds, which are finite for the transversal direction and periodic with respect to the axis of the manifold, i.e., Laplacians on tori. We construct an infinite dimensional analytic isomorphism between the space of profiles (the radius of the rotation) of the torus and the spectral data as well as the stability estimates: those for the spectral data in terms of the profile and conversely, for the profile in term of the spectral data.
