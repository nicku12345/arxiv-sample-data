We consider Sturm-Liouville operators with singular potentials from the class on star-type graph with cycle, which consist the edges with commensurable lengths. Asymptotic representation for eigenvalues for such operators is obtained. Recovering of the characteristic function the Sturm-Liouville operators with the singular potentials is considered.
