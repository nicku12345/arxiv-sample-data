Under certain assumptions (including d\ge 2) we prove that the spectrum of a scalar operator in \mathscr{L}^2(\mathbb{R}^d) \begin{equation*} A_\varepsilon (x,hD)= A^0(hD) + \varepsilon B(x,hD), \end{equation*} covers interval (\tau-\epsilon,\tau+\epsilon), where A^0 is an elliptic operator and B(x,hD) is a periodic perturbation, \varepsilon=O(h^\varkappa), \varkappa>0.   Further, we consider generalizations.
