The authors study the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators that are subject to certain types of perturbations.   An iterative introduction of infinitely many randomly coupled rank-one perturbations is one of our settings. Spectral theoretic tools are developed to estimate the remaining absolutely continuous spectrum of the resulting random operators. Curious choices of the perturbation directions that depend on the previous realizations of the coupling parameters are assumed, and unitary intertwining operators are used. An application of our analysis shows localization of the random operator associated to the Rademacher potential.   Obtaining fundamental bounds on the types of spectrum under rank-one perturbation, without restriction on its direction, is another main objective. This is accomplished by analyzing Borel/Cauchy transforms centrally associated with rank-one perturbation problems.
