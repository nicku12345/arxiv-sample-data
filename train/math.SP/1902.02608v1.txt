The eccentricity matrix of a connected graph G is obtained from the distance matrix of G by retaining the largest distances in each row and each column, and setting the remaining entries as 0. In this article, a conjecture about the least eigenvalue of eccentricity matrices of trees, presented in the article [Jianfeng Wang, Mei Lu, Francesco Belardo, Milan Randic. The anti-adjacency matrix of a graph: Eccentricity matrix. Discrete Applied Mathematics, 251: 299-309, 2018.], is solved affirmatively. In addition to this, the spectra and the inertia of eccentricity matrices of various classes of graphs are investigated.
