Using Roelcke formula for the Green function, we explicitly construct a basis in the kernel of the adjoint Laplacian on a compact polyhedral surface X and compute the S-matrix of X at the zero value of the spectral parameter. We apply these results to study various self-adjoint extensions of a symmetric Laplacian on a compact polyhedral surface of genus two with a single conical point. It turns out that the behaviour of the S-matrix at the zero value of the spectral parameter is sensitive to the geometry of the polyhedron.
