A lower semi-definite self-adjoint linear operator in a Hilbert space is taken whose discrete spectrum is not empty and comprises at least several eigenvalues \lambda_{min}=\lambda_1\leqslant\ldots\leqslant\lambda_m<\sigma_{ess}. The problem of approximation of these eigenvalues by eigenvalues of some linear operator in a finite-dimensional space of the dimension s is considered and solved. The accuracy of the approximation obtained becomes unlimitedly high as s\to\infty.
