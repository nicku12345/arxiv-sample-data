Stimulated by the category theorems of Eisner and Ser\'eny in the setting of unitary and isometric C_0-semigroups on separable Hilbert spaces, we prove category theorems for Schr\"odinger semigroups. Specifically, we show that, to a given class of Schr\"{o}dinger semigroups, Baire generically the semigroups are strongly stable but not exponentially stable. We also present a typical spectral property of the corresponding Schr\"{o}dinger operators.
