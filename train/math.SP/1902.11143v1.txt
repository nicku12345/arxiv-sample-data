This memoir is devoted to a part of the results from the author about two topics: in the first part, the asymptotics of the low-lying eigenvalues of Schr\"odinger operators in domains that may have corners, and in the second part, the analysis of the thresholds of a class of fibered operators. The main common object is the magnetic Laplacian, and the two parts are connected through the study of model problems in unbounded domains.
