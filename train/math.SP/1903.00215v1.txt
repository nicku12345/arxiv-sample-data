We study the limiting behavior of the eigenvalues of Krein-Feller-Operators with respect to weakly convergent probability measures. Therefore, we give a representation of the eigenvalues as zeros of measure theoretic sine functions. Further, we make a proposition about the limiting behavior of the previously determined eigenfunctions. With the main results we finally determine the speed of convergence of eigenvalues and -functions for sequences which converge to invariant measures on the Cantor set.
