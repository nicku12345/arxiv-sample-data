Let R be a Hermitian matrix. The energy of R, \mathcal{E}(R), corresponds to the sum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues. In this work it is obtained two lower bounds for \mathcal{E}(R). The first one generalizes a lower bound obtained by Mc Clellands for the energy of graphs in 1971 to the case of Hermitian matrices and graphs with a given nullity. The second one generalizes a lower bound obtained by K. Das, S. A. Mojallal and I. Gutman in 2013 to symmetric non-negative matrices and graphs with a given nullity. The equality cases are discussed. These lower bounds are obtained for graphs with m edges and some examples are provided showing that, some obtained bounds are incomparable with the known lower bound for the energy 2\sqrt{m}. Another family of lower bounds are obtained from an increasing sequence of lower bounds for the spectral radius of a graph. The bounds are stated for singular and non-singular graphs.
