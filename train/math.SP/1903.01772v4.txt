A bounded linear Hilbert space operator S is said to be a 2-isometry if the operator S and its adjoint S^* satisfy the relation S^{*2}S^{2} - 2 S^{*}S + I = 0. In this paper, we study Hilbert space operators having liftings or dilations to 2-isometries. The adjoint of an operator which admits such liftings is characterized as the restriction of a backward shift on a Hilbert space of vector-valued analytic functions. These results are applied to concave operators (i.e., operators S such that S^{*2}S^{2} - 2 S^{*}S + I \le 0) and to operators similar to contractions or isometries. Two types of liftings to 2-isometries, as well as the extensions induced by them, are constructed and isomorphic minimal liftings are discussed.
