In this paper, quantitative upper estimates for the number of eigenvalues lying below the essential spectrum of Schroedinger operators with potentials generated by Ahlfors regular measures in a strip subject to two different types of boundary conditions (Robin and Dirichlet respectively) are presented. The estimates are presented in terms of weighted L^1 norms and Orlicz norms of the potential.
