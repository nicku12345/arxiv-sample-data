Let \varphi:\mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{D} be a holomorphic map with a fixed point \alpha\in\mathbb{D} such that 0\leq |\varphi'(\alpha)|<1. We show that the spectrum of the composition operator C_\varphi on the Fr\'echet space  \textrm{Hol}(\mathbb{D}) is \{0\}\cup \{ \varphi'(\alpha)^n:n=0,1,\cdots\} and its essential spectrum is reduced to \{0\}. This contrasts the situation where a restriction of C_\varphi to Banach spaces such as H^2(\mathbb{D}) is considered. Our proofs are based on explicit formulae for the spectral projections associated with the point spectrum found by Koenigs. Finally, as a byproduct, we obtain information on the spectrum for bounded composition operators induced by a Schr\"oder symbol on arbitrary Banach spaces of holomorphic functions.
