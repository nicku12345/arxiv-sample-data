We shall ponder the Prime Geodesic Theorem for the Picard manifold \mathcal{M} = \mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}[i]) \backslash \mathfrak{h}^{3}, which asks about the asymptotic behaviour of a counting function for the closed geodesics on \mathcal{M}. Let E_{\Gamma}(X) be the error term arising from counting prime geodesics, we then prove the bound E_{\Gamma}(X) \ll X^{3/2+\epsilon} on average, as well as various versions of pointwise bounds. The second moment bound is the pure counterpart of work of Balog et al. for \Gamma = \mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}), and the main innovation entails the delicate analysis of sums of Kloosterman sums with an explicit evaluation of oscillatory integrals. Our pointwise bounds concern Weyl-type subconvex bounds for quadratic Dirichlet L-functions over \mathbb{Q}(i). Interestingly, we are also able to establish an asymptotic law for the spectral exponential sum in the spectral aspect for a cofinite Kleinian group \Gamma. Finally, we produce numerical experiments of its behaviour, visualising that E_{\Gamma}(X) obeys a conjectural bound of the size O(X^{1+\epsilon}).
