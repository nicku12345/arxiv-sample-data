We continue the work of a previous paper \cite{LJL} to derive the dispersion relations of the periodic quantum graphs associated with the remaining 5 of the 11 Archimedean tilings, namely the truncated hexagonal tiling (3,12^2), rhombi-trihexagonal tiling (3,4,6,4), snub square tiling (3^2,4,3,6), snub trihexagonal tiling (3^4,6), and truncated trihexagonal tiling (4,6,12). The computation is done with the help of the symbolic software Mathematica. With these explicit dispersion relations, we perform more analysis on the spectra.
