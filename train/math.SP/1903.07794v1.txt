The works of V. A. Vinokurov have shown that eigenvalues and normalized eigenfunctions of Sturm-Liouville problems are analytic in potentials, considered as mappings from the Lebesgue space to the space of real numbers and the Banach space of continuous functions respectively. Moreover, the first-order Frechet derivatives are known and paly an important role in many problems. In this paper, we will find the second-order Frechet derivatives of eigenvalues in potentials, which are also proved to be negative definite quadratic forms for some cases.
