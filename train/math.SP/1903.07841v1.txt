We study the Laplacian eigenvalues of the zero divisor graph \Gamma\left(\mathbb{Z}_{n}\right) of the ring \mathbb{Z}_{n} and prove that \Gamma\left(\mathbb{Z}_{p^t}\right) is Laplacian integral for every prime p and positive integer t\geq 2. We also prove that the Laplacian spectral radius and the algebraic connectivity of \Gamma\left(\mathbb{Z}_{n}\right) for most of the values of n are, respectively, the largest and the second smallest eigenvalues of the vertex weighted Laplacian matrix of a graph which is defined on the set of proper divisors of n. The values of n for which algebraic connectivity and vertex connectivity of \Gamma\left(\mathbb{Z}_{n}\right) coincide are also characterized.
