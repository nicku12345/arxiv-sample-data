This article is the continuation of our first work on the determination of the cases where there is equality in Courant's Nodal Domain theorem in the case of a Robin boundary condition (with Robin parameter h). For the square, our first paper focused on the case where h is large and extended results that were obtained by Pleijel, B\'erard--Helffer, for the problem with a Dirichlet boundary condition. There, we also obtained some general results about the behaviour of the nodal structure (for planar domains) under a small deformation of h, where h is positive and not close to 0. In this second paper, we extend results that were obtained by Helffer--Persson-Sundqvist for the Neumann problem to the case where h>0 is small.
