In 1966, H. Widom proved an asymptotic formula for the distribution of eigenvalues of the N\times N truncated Hilbert matrix for large values of N. In this paper, we extend this formula to Hankel matrices with symbols in the class of piece-wise continuous functions on the unit circle. Furthermore, we show that the distribution of the eigenvalues is independent of the choice of truncation (e.g. square or triangular truncation).
