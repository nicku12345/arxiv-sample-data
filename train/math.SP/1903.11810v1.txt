The periodic Schrodinger operator  H  on a discrete periodic graph is considered. We estimate the discrete spectrum of the perturbed operator  H _ {-} (t) = H-tV ,  t> 0 , where the potential  V \ ge 0  is decreasing and t>0 is the coupling constant. If the potential has a power asymptotics at infinity, then we obtain asymptotics of the discrete spectrum of operator  H_ {-} (t)  with a large coupling constant.
