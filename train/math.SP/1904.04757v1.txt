A bounded linear operator T on a Banach space X is said to be generalized Drazin-meromorphic invertible if there exists a bounded linear operator S acting on X such that TS=ST, STS=S,  TST-T is meromorphic. We shall say that T admits a generalized Kato-meromorphic decomposition if there exists a pair of T-invariant closed subspaces (M,N) such that X=M\oplus N, the reduction T_M is Kato and the reduction T_N is meromorphic. In this paper we shall investigate such kind of operators and corresponding spectra, the generalized Drazin-meromorphic spectrum and the generalized Kato-meromorphic spectrum, and prove that these spectra are empty if and only if the operator T is polynomially meromorphic. Also we obtain that the generalized Kato-meromorphic spectrum differs from the Kato type spectrum on at most countably many points. Among others, bounded linear operators which can be expressed as a direct sum of a meromorphic operator and a bounded below (resp. surjective, upper (lower) semi-Fredholm, Fredholm, upper (lower) semi-Weyl, Weyl) operator are studied. In particular, we shall characterize the single-valued extension property at a point \lambda_0\in\mathbb{C} in the case that \lambda_0-T admits a generalized Kato-meromorphic decomposition. As a consequence we get several results on cluster points of some distinguished parts of the spectrum.
