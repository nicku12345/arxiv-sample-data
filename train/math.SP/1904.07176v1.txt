Let H be a generalized Schr\"odinger operator on a domain of a non-compact connected Riemannian manifold, and a generalized eigenfunction u for H: that is, u satisfies the equation Hu=\lambda u in the weak sense but is not necessarily in L^2. The problem is to find conditions on the growth of u, so that \lambda belongs to the spectrum of H. We unify and generalize known results on this problem. In addition, a variety of examples is provided, illustrating the different nature of the growth conditions.
