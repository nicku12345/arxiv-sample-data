We provide complementary semiclassical bounds for the Riesz means R_1(z) of the eigenvalues of various biharmonic operators, with a second term in the expected power of z. The method we discuss makes use of the averaged variational principle (AVP), and yields two-sided bounds for individual eigenvalues, which are semiclassically sharp. The AVP also yields comparisons with Riesz means of different operators, in particular Laplacians.
