Consider a difference operator H with periodic coefficients on the   octant of the lattice. We show that for any integer N and any bounded interval I, there exists an operator H having N eigenvalues, counted with multiplicity on this interval, and does not exist   other spectra on the interval. Also right and to the left of it are spectra and the corresponding subspaces have an infinite dimension.   Moreover, we prove similar results for other domains and any dimension. The proof is based on the inverse spectral theory for periodic Jacobi operators.
