Let \{\hat{P}_{n}(x)\} be an orthonormal polynomial sequence and denote by \{w_{n}(x)\} the respective sequence of functions of the second kind. Suppose the Hamburger moment problem for \{\hat{P}_{n}(x)\} is determinate and denote by J the corresponding Jacobi matrix operator on \ell^{2}. We show that if J is positive definite and J^{-1} belongs to the trace class then the series on the right-hand side of the defining equation \[ \mathfrak{F}(z):=1-z\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}w_{n}(0)\hat{P}_{n}(z) \] converges locally uniformly on \mathbb{C} and it holds true that \mathfrak{F}(z)=\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-z/\lambda_{n}) where \{\lambda_{n};\,n=1,2,3,\ldots\}=\mathrm{Spec}\,J. Furthermore, the Al-Salam-Carlitz II polynomials are treated as an example of orthogonal polynomials to which this theorem can be applied.
