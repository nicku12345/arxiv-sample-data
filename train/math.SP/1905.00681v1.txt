We study an exponential sum over Laplace eigenvalues \lambda_{j} = 1/4+t_{j}^{2} with t_{j} \leqslant T for Maass cusp forms on \Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H} as T grows, where \Gamma \subset PSL_{2}(\mathbb{R}) is a cofinite Fuchsian group acting on the upper half-plane \mathbb{H}. Specifically, for the congruence subgroups \Gamma_{0}(q), \, \Gamma_{1}(q) and \Gamma(q), we explicitly describe each sum in terms of a certain oscillatory component, von Mangoldt-like functions and the Selberg zeta function. We also establish a new expression of the spectral exponential sum for a general cofinite group \Gamma \subset PSL_{2}(\mathbb{R}), and in particular we find that the behavior of the sum is decisively determined by whether \Gamma is essentially cuspidal or not. We also work with certain moonshine groups for which our plotting of the spectral exponential sum alludes to the fact that the conjectural bound O(X^{1/2+\epsilon}) in the Prime Geodesic Theorem may be allowable. In view of our numerical evidence, the conjecture of Petridis and Risager is generalized.
