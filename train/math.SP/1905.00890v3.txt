We consider billiards obtained by removing from the plane finitely many strictly convex analytic obstacles satisfying the non-eclipse condition. The restriction of the dynamics to the set of non-escaping orbits is conjugated to a subshift, which provides a natural labeling of periodic orbits. We show that under suitable symmetry and genericity assumptions, the Marked Length Spectrum determines the geometry of the billiard table.
