In this paper, we study the two-point Weyl Law for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a smooth, compact Riemannian manifold M with no conjugate points. That is, we find the asymptotic behavior of the Schwartz kernel, E_\lambda(x,y), of the projection operator from L^2(M) onto the direct sum of eigenspaces with eigenvalue smaller than \lambda^2 as \lambda \to\infty. In the regime where x,y are restricted to a compact neighborhood of the diagonal in M\times M, we obtain a uniform logarithmic improvement in the remainder of the asymptotic expansion for E_\lambda and its derivatives of all orders, which generalizes a result of B\'erard, who treated the on-diagonal case E_\lambda(x,x). When x,y avoid a compact neighborhood of the diagonal, we obtain this same improvement in an upper bound for E_\lambda. Our results imply that the rescaled covariance kernel of a monochromatic random wave locally converges in the C^\infty topology to a universal scaling limit at an inverse logarithmic rate.
