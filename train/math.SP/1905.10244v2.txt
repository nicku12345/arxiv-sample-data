Consider an N\times N Toeplitz matrix T_N with symbol {a }(\lambda) := \sum_{\ell=-d_2}^{d_1} a_\ell \lambda^\ell, perturbed by an additive noise matrix N^{-\gamma} E_N, where the entries of E_N are centered i.i.d.~random variables of unit variance and \gamma>1/2. It is known that the empirical measure of eigenvalues of the perturbed matrix converges weakly, as N\to\infty, to the law of {a}(U), where U is distributed uniformly on \mathbb{S}^1. In this paper, we consider the outliers, i.e. eigenvalues that are at a positive (N-independent) distance from {a}(\mathbb{S}^1). We prove that there are no outliers outside {\rm spec} \, T({a}), the spectrum of the limiting Toeplitz operator, with probability approaching one, as N \to \infty. {In contrast,} in {\rm spec}\, T({a})\setminus {a}({\mathbb S}^1) the process of outliers converges to the point process described by the zero set of certain random {analytic} functions. The limiting random {analytic} functions can be expressed as linear combinations of the determinants of finite sub-matrices of an infinite dimensional matrix, whose entries are i.i.d.~having the same law as that of E_N. The coefficients in the linear combination depend on the roots of the polynomial P_{z, {a}}(\lambda):= ({a}(\lambda) -z)\lambda^{d_2}=0 and semi-standard Young Tableaux with shapes determined by the number of roots of P_{z,{a}}(\lambda)=0 that are greater than one in moduli.
