We study the spectra of general N\times N Toeplitz matrices given by symbols in the Wiener Algebra perturbed by small complex Gaussian random matrices, in the regime N\gg 1. We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of eigenvalues of the perturbed matrix in smooth domains. We show that these eigenvalues follow a Weyl law with probability sub-exponentially close to 1, as N\gg1, in particular that most eigenvalues of the perturbed Toeplitz matrix are close to the curve in the complex plane given by the symbol of the unperturbed Toeplitz matrix.
