Let M be a compact, connected Riemannian manifold whose Riemannian volume measure is denoted by \sigma. Let f: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R} be a non-constant eigenfunction of the Laplacian. The random wave conjecture suggests that in certain situations, the value distribution of f under \sigma is approximately Gaussian. Write \mu for the measure whose density with respect to \sigma is |\nabla f|^2. We observe that the value distribution of f under \mu admits a unimodal density attaining its maximum at the origin. Thus, in a sense, the zero set of an eigenfunction is the largest of all level sets. When M is a manifold with boundary, the same holds for Laplace eigenfunctions satisfying either the Dirichlet or the Neumann boundary conditions. Additionally, we prove a monotonicity formula for level sets of solid spherical harmonics, essentially by viewing nodal sets of harmonic functions as weighted minimal hypersurfaces.
