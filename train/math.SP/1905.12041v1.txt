Let \Omega \subset {\bf R}^d be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary \Gamma. It will be shown that the Jordan chains of m-sectorial second-order elliptic partial differential operators with measurable coefficients and (local or non-local) Robin boundary conditions in L_2(\Omega) can be characterized with the help of Jordan chains of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map and the boundary operator from H^{1/2}(\Gamma) into H^{-1/2}(\Gamma). This result extends the Birman--Schwinger principle in the framework of elliptic operators for the characterization of eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and geometric eigenspaces to the complete set of all generalized eigenfunctions and algebraic eigenspaces.
