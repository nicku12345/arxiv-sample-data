This paper focuses on the stability of self-adjointness of linear relations under perturbations in Hilbert spaces. It is shown that a self-adjoint relation is still self-adjoint under bounded and relatively bounded perturbations. The results obtained in the present paper generalize the corresponding results for linear operators to linear relations, and some weaken the conditions of the related existing results.
