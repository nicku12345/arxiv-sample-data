This work is a continuation of our previos paper \cite{Zel1}, where for the the Schr\"odinger operator H=-\Delta+ V(\e)\cdot (V(\e)\ge 0), acting in the space L_2(\R^d)\,(d\ge 3), some constructive sufficient conditions for discreteness of its spectrum have been obtained on the base of well known Mazya -Shubin criterion and an optimization problem for a set function. Using a {\it capacitary strong type inequality} of David Adams, the concept of {\it base polyhedron} for the harmonic capacity and some properties of Choquet integral by this capacity, we obtain more general sufficient conditions for discreteness of the spectrum of H in terms of a repeated nonincreasing rearrangement of the function Y(\e,\bt)=\sqrt{V(\e)}\frac{1}{|\e-\bt|^{d-2}}\sqrt{V(\bt)} on cubes that are going to infinity.
