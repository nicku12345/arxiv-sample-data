Partial inverse problems are studied for Sturm-Liouville operators with a discontinuity. The main results of the paper are local solvability and stability of the considered inverse problems. Our approach is based on a constructive algorithm for solving the inverse problems. The key role in our method is played by the Riesz-basis property of a special vector-functional system in a Hilbert space. In addition, we obtain a new uniqueness theorem for recovering the potential on a part of the interval, by using a fractional part of the spectrum.
