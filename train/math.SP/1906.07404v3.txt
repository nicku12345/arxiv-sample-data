We define the Ricci curvature on simplicial complexes modifying the definition of the Ricci curvature on graphs, and prove some properties. One of our main results is an estimate of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on simplicial complexes by the Ricci curvature. Another of our main results is obtaining the relation between the Ricci curvature on a simplicial complex and the Ricci curvature on a dual graph of the simplicial complex.
