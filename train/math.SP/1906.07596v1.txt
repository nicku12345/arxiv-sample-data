We consider a non self-adjoint Laplacian on a directed graph with non symmetric weights on edges. We give a criterion for the m-accretiveness and the m-sectoriality of this Laplacian. Our results are based on a comparison of this operator with its symmetric part for which we can apply dierent results concerning essential self-adjointness of a symmetric Laplace operator on an innite graph. This gives results on the heat operator related to our non-symmetric Laplacian.
