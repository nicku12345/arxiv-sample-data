In this paper we express the eigenvalues of anti-heptadiagonal persymmetric Hankel matrices as the zeros of explicit polynomials giving also a representation of its eigenvectors. We present also an expression depending on localizable parameters to compute its integer powers. In particular, an explicit formula not depending on any unknown parameter for the inverse of anti-heptadiagonal persymmetric Hankel matrices is provided.
