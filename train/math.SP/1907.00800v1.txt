This is an expanded writeup of a talk given by the second author at Erik Balslev's 75th birthday conference on October 1-2, 2010 at Aarhus University. We summarize our work on Fermi's golden rule and higher order phenomena for hyperbolic manifolds. A topic which occupied the last part of Erik Balslev's research.
