This article is concerned with the isospectral problem \[ -f'' + \frac{1}{4} f = z\omega f + z^2 \upsilon f \] for the periodic conservative Camassa-Holm flow, where \omega is a periodic real distribution in H^{-1}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}) and \upsilon is a periodic non-negative Borel measure on \mathbb{R}. We develop basic Floquet theory for this problem, derive trace formulas for the associated spectra and establish continuous dependence of these spectra on the coefficients with respect to a weak^\ast topology.
