Multiplicative and additive D-stability, diagonal stability, Schur D-stability, H-stability are classical concepts which arise in studying linear dynamical systems. We unify these types of stability, as well as many others, in one concept of ({\mathfrak D}, {\mathcal G}, \circ)-stability, which depends on a stability region {\mathfrak D} \subset {\mathbb C}, a matrix class {\mathcal G} and a binary matrix operation \circ. This approach allows us to unite several well-known matrix problems and to consider common methods of their analysis. In order to collect these methods, we make a historical review, concentrating on diagonal and D-stability. We prove some elementary properties of ({\mathfrak D}, {\mathcal G}, \circ)-stable matrices, uniting the facts that are common for many partial cases. Basing on the properties of a stability region \mathfrak D which may be chosen to be a concrete subset of \mathbb C (e.g. the unit disk) or to belong to a specified type of regions (e.g. LMI regions) we briefly describe the methods of further development of the theory of ({\mathfrak D}, {\mathcal G}, \circ)-stability. We mention some applications of the theory of ({\mathfrak D}, {\mathcal G}, \circ)-stability to the dynamical systems of different types.
