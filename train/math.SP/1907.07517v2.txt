In this work, we give sharp asymptotic equivalents in the limit h\to 0 of the small eigenvalues of the Witten Laplacian, that is the operator associated with the quadratic form  \psi\in H^1_0(\Omega)\mapsto h^2 \int_\Omega \big \vert \nabla \big (e^{\frac 1hf} \psi\big )\big \vert^2\, e^{-\frac 2hf},where \overline\Omega=\Omega\cup \partial \Omega is an oriented C^\infty compact and connected Riemannian manifold with non empty boundary \partial \Omega and f: \overline \Omega\to \mathbb R is a C^\infty Morse function. The function f is allowed to admit critical points on  \partial \Omega, which is the main novelty of this work in comparison with the existing literature.
