We study the spectrum of non-homogeneous partially hinged plates having structural engineering applications. A possible way to prevent instability phenomena is to maximize the ratio between the frequencies of certain oscillating modes with respect to the density function of the plate; we prove existence of optimal densities and we investigate their analytic expression. This analysis suggests where to locate reinforcing material within the plate; some numerical experiments give further information and support the theoretical results.
