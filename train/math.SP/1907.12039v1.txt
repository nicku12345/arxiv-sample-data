Consider n linearly independent vectors in \mathbb{C}^n which form columns of a matrix A. The recursive evaluation of eigen directions (normalized eigenvectors) of A is the solution of an eigenvalue problem of the form A_iX_i=X_i\Lambda_i with i=0,1,2 \dots; and here \Lambda_i is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and columns of X_i are the eigenvectors. Note that A_{i+1}=\phi(X_i) where \phi normalizes all eigenvectors to unit \mathcal{L}_2 norm such that all diagonal elements [\phi(X)^\dagger\phi(X)]_{jj}=1. It is to be proven that for any matrix A_o and n \leq 7, the limiting set of matrices A_i with i \to \infty is the set of unitary matrices U(n) with X_i^\dagger X_i \to I. Interestingly, this problem also represents a recursive map that maximizes some average distance among a set of n points on the unit n-sphere. We first formally pose this conjecture, present extensive numerical results highlighting it, and prove it for special cases.
