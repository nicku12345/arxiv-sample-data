We obtain an explicit classification of all 2\times 2 real hypergeometric Bochner pairs, ie. pairs (W(x),\mathfrak{D}) consisting of a 2\times 2 real hypergeometric differential operator \mathfrak{D} and a 2\times 2 weight matrix satisfying the property that \mathfrak{D} is symmetric with respect to the matrix-valued inner product defined by W(x). Furthermore, we obtain a classifying space of hypergeometric Bochner pairs by describing a bijective correspondence between the collection of pairs and an open subset of a real algebraic set whose smooth paths correspond to isospectral deformations of the weight W(x) preserving a bispectral property. We also relate the hypergeometric Bochner pairs to classical Bochner pairs via noncommutative bispectral Darboux transformations.
