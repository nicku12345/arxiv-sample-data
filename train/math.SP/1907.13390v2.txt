A new idea to approximate the second eigenfunction and the second eigenvalue of p-Laplace operator is given. In the case of the Dirichlet boundary condition, the scheme has the restriction that the positive and the negative part of the second eigenfunction have equal L^p-norm, however, in the case of Neumann boundary condition, our algorithm has not such restriction. Our algorithm generates a descending sequence of positive numbers that converges to the second eigenvalue. We give various examples and computational tests.
