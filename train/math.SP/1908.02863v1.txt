Based on a previous paper [Chr17] on Neumann data for Dirichlet eigenfunctions on triangles, we extend the study in two ways. First, we investigate the (semi-classical) Neumann data mass on perturbed triangles. Specifically, we replace one side of a triangle by adding a smooth perturbation, and assume that the disparity between the perturbation and the original side is bounded by a small value \epsilon. Second, we add a small \epsilon sized potential to the (semi-classical) Laplacian and see how the results change on triangles. In both cases, we find that the L^2 norm of Neumann data on each side is close to the length of the side divided by the area of the triangle, and the difference is dominated by \epsilon.
