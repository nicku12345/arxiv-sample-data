This article concerns the asymptotic geometric character of the nodal set of the eigenfunctions of the Steklov eigenvalue problem  -\Delta \phi_{\sigma_j}=0,\quad\text{ on }\Omega,\qquad\qquad \partial_\nu \phi_{\sigma_j}=\sigma_j \phi_{\sigma_j}\quad \text{ on }\partial\Omega  in two-dimensional domains \Omega. In particular, this paper presents a dense family \mathcal{A} of simply-connected two-dimensional domains with analytic boundaries such that, for each \Omega\in \mathcal{A}, the nodal set of the eigenfunction \phi_{\sigma_j} "is not dense at scale \sigma_j^{-1}". This result addresses a question put forth under "Open Problem 10" in Girouard and Polterovich, J. Spectr. Theory, 321-359 (2017). In fact, the results in the present paper establish that, for domains \Omega\in \mathcal{A}, the nodal sets of the eigenfunctions \phi_{\sigma_j} associated with the eigenvalue \sigma_j have starkly different character than anticipated: they are not dense at any shrinking scale. More precisely, for each \Omega\in \mathcal{A} there is a value r_1>0 such that for each j there is x_j\in \Omega such that \phi_{\sigma_j} does not vanish on the ball of radius r_1 around x_j.
