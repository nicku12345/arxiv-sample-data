In this paper, a Sturm-Liouville boundary value problem equiped with conformable fractional derivates is considered. We give some uniqueness theorems for the solutions of inverse problems according to the Weyl function, two given spectra and classical spectral data. We also study on half-inverse problem and prove a Hochstadt and Lieberman-type theorem.
