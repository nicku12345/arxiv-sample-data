The problem of determining DS_n, the complex numbers that occur as an eigenvalue of an n-by-n doubly stochastic matrix, has been a target of study for some time. The Perfect-Mirsky region, PM_n, is contained in DS_n, and is known to be exactly DS_n for n \leq 4, but strictly contained within DS_n for n = 5. Here, we present a Boundary Conjecture that asserts that the boundary of DS_n is achieved by eigenvalues of convex combinations of pairs of (or single) permutation matrices. We present a method to efficiently compute a portion of DS_n, and obtain computational results that support the Boundary Conjecture. We also give evidence that DS_n is equal to PM_n for certain n > 5.
