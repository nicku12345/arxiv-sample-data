Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold with a boundary of class \mathscr{C}^{1}. We are interested in the spectrum of the weighted Laplacian on M with Neumann boundary conditions. More precisely, given \rho and \sigma two positive functions on M, we study the eigenvalues of the equation -\operatorname{div}(\sigma \nabla u)=\lambda\rho u. Inspired by a recent work of B. Colbois and A. El Soufi, we investigate upper bounds for the eigenvalues in the case where \sigma=\rho^{\alpha}, \alpha>0. We show that \alpha = \frac{n-2}{n} plays a critical role in the estimation of the spectrum when the total mass of \rho is fixed.
