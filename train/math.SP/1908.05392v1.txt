We derive explicit Krein resolvent identities for generally singular Sturm-Liouville operators in terms of boundary condition bases and the Lagrange bracket. As an application of the resolvent identities obtained, we compute the trace of the resolvent difference of a pair of self-adjoint realizations of the Bessel expression -d^2/dx^2+(\nu^2-(1/4))x^{-2} on (0,\infty) for values of the parameter \nu\in[0,1) and use the resulting trace formula to explicitly determine the spectral shift function for the pair.
