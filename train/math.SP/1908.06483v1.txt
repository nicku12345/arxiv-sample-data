We study the behaviour of extremal eigenvalues of the Dirichlet biharmonic operator over rectangles with a given fixed area. We begin by proving that the principal eigenvalue is minimal for a rectangle for which the ratio between the longest and the shortest side lengths does not exceed 1.066459. We then consider the sequence formed by the minimal k^{\rm th} eigenvalue and show that the corresponding sequence of minimising rectangles converges to the square as k goes to infinity.
