We study strong instability (by blow-up) of the standing waves for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with \delta-interaction on a star graph \Gamma. The key ingredient is a novel variational technique applied to the standing wave solutions being minimizers of a specific variational problem. We also show well-posedness of the corresponding Cauchy problem in the domain of the self-adjoint operator which defines \delta-interaction. This permits to prove virial identity for the H^1- solutions to the Cauchy problem. We also prove certain strong instability results for the standing waves of the NLS-\delta' equation on the line.
