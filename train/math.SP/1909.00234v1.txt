A generalized power hypergraph \mathcal{H}^k_s is obtained from a base hypergraph \mathcal{H} by means of some simple edge-expansion operations. Kang, Liu, Qi and Yuan [8] proved that the nonzero eigenvalues of \mathcal{H} give rise to nonzero eigenvalues of \mathcal{H}^k_s. In this paper we show that all nonzero eigenvalues of \mathcal{H}^k_s may be computed from the eigenvalues of its base hypergraph \mathcal{H} and of its subgraphs. To prove this, we derive spectral results about edge-expansion operations that may be interesting on their own sake.
