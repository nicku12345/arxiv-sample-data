In this paper we define signless Laplacian matrix of a hypergraph and obtain structural properties from its eigenvalues. We generalize several known results for graphs, relating the spectrum of this matrix with structural parameters of the hypergraph such as the maximum degree, diameter and the chromatic number. In addition, we characterize the complete signless Laplacian spectrum for the class of the power hypergraphs from the spectrum of its base hypergraph.
