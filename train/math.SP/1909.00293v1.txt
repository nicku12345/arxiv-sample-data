The paper is devoted to (combinations of) Bessel cross-products that arise from oblique derivative boundary value problems for the Laplacian in a circular annulus. We show that like their Neumann-Laplacian counterpart (and unlike the Dirichlet-Laplacian), they possess two kinds of zeros: those that can be derived by McMahon series and diverge to infinity in the limit, and exceptional ones that remain finite. For both cases we find asymptotic expressions for a fixed oblique angle and vanishing thickness of the annulus. We further present plots of numerically computed zeros and discuss their behaviour when the oblique angle changes and the thickness remains fixed.
