In this paper, we study a singular perturbation of a problem used in dimension two to model graphene or in dimension three to describe the quark confinement phenomenon in hadrons. The operators we consider are of the form H + M\beta V (x), where H is the free Dirac operator, \beta is a constant matrix, V (x) is a real valued piecewise constant potential having a jump discontinuity across a smooth interface and M is the mass that we can see as a coupling constant. In particular, we perform a complete asymptotic expansion of spectral quantities as the mass M tends to +\infty.
