The self-adjoint matrix Sturm-Liouville operator on a finite interval with a boundary condition in the general form is studied. We obtain asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and the weight matrices of the considered operator. These spectral characteristics play an important role in the inverse spectral theory. Our technique is based on analysis of analytic functions and on the contour integration in the complex plane of the spectral parameter. In addition, we adapt the obtained asymptotic formulas to the Sturm-Liouville operators on a star-shaped graph with two different types of matching conditions.
