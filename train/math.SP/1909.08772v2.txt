In this paper we study the multi-frequency quasi-periodic operator with Gevrey type perturbation. We first establish large deviation theorem (LDT) for multi-dimensional quasi-periodic operator under sub-exponentially decaying long-range perturbation, and then prove its pure point spectrum property. Based on the LDT and Aubry duality, we show the absence of point spectrum for 1D quasi-periodic long-range operator with multi-frequency and small Gevrey potential (without transversality restriction). We also prove the positivity of Lebesgue measure of spectrum.
