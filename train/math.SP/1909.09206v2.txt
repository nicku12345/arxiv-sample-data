We present certain results on the direct and inverse spectral theory of the Jacobi operator with complex periodic coefficients. For instance, we show that any N-th degree polynomial whose leading coefficient is (-1)^N is the Hill discriminant of finitely many discrete N-periodic Schr\"{o}dinger operators (Theorem 1). Also, in the case where the spectrum is a closed interval we prove a result (Theorem 5) which is the analog of Borg's Theorem for the non-self-adjoint Jacobi case.
