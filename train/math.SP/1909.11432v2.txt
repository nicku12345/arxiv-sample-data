We develop cohomological interpretations for several types of automorphic forms for Hecke triangle groups of infinite covolume. We then use these interpretations to establish explicit isomorphisms between spaces of automorphic forms, cohomology spaces and spaces of eigenfunctions of transfer operators. These results show a deep relation between spectral entities of Hecke surfaces of infinite volume and the dynamics of their geodesic flows.
