Let G be a simple graph. In 1986, Herbert Wilf asked what kind of graphs have an eigenvector with entries formed only by \pm 1? In this paper, we answer this question for the adjacency, Laplacian and signless Laplacian matrix of a graph. Besides, we generalize the concept of an exact graph to the adjacency and signless Laplacian matrices. Infinity families of exact graphs for all those matrices are presented.
