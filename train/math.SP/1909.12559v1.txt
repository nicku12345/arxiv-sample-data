In this paper we develop L^{p} estimates for functions u which are joint quasimodes of semiclassical pseudodifferential operators p_{1}(x,hD) and p_{2}(x,hD) whose characteristic sets meet with kth order contact, k\geq{}1. As part of the technical development we use Fourier integral operators to adapt a flat wavelet analysis to the curved level sets of p_{1}(x,\xi).
