We study Sturm-Liouville operators on closed sets of a special structure, which are sometimes referred as time scales and often appear in modelling various real processes. Depending on the set structure, such operators unify both differential and difference operators. We obtain properties of their spectral characteristics and study inverse problems with respect to them. We prove that the spectral characteristics uniquely determine the operator.
