In this paper, we associate a class of Hurwitz matrix polynomials with Stieltjes positive definite matrix sequences. This connection leads to an extension of two classical criteria of Hurwitz stability for real polynomials to matrix polynomials: tests for Hurwitz stability via positive definiteness of block-Hankel matrices built from matricial Markov parameters and via matricial Stieltjes continued fractions. We obtain further conditions for Hurwitz stability in terms of block-Hankel minors and quasiminors, which may be viewed as a weak version of the total positivity criterion.
