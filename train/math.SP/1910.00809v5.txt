In the paper, Sturm--Liouville differential operators on time scales consisting of a finite number of isolated points and segments are considered. Such operators unify differential and difference operators. We obtain properties of their spectral characteristics including asymptotic formulae for eigenvalues and weight numbers. Uniqueness theorem is proved for recovering the operators from the spectral characteristics.
