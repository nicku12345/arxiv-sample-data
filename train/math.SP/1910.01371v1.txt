Let \mathscr{B}=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^d : |x|<R \} (d\geq 3) be a ball. We consider the Dirichlet Laplacian associated with \mathscr{B} and prove that its eigenvalue counting function has an asymptotics \begin{equation*} \mathscr{N}_\mathscr{B}(\mu)=C_d vol(\mathscr{B})\mu^d-C'_d vol(\partial \mathscr{B})\mu^{d-1}+O\left(\mu^{d-2+\frac{131}{208}}(\log \mu)^{\frac{18627}{8320}}\right) \end{equation*} as \mu\rightarrow \infty.
