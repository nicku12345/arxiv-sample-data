We explicitly classify all S^1-invariant free boundary minimal annuli and M\"obius bands in \mathbb{B}^n. This classification is obtained from an analysis of the spectrum of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for S^1-invariant metrics on the annulus and M\"obius band. First, we determine the supremum of the k-th normalized Steklov eigenvalue among all S^1-invariant metrics on the M\"obius band for each k \geq 1, and show that it is achieved by the induced metric from a free boundary minimal embedding of the M\"obius band into \mathbb{B}^4 by k-th Steklov eigenfunctions. We then show that the critical metrics of the normalized Steklov eigenvalues on the space of S^1-invariant metrics on the annulus and M\"obius band are the induced metrics on explicit free boundary minimal annuli and M\"obius bands in \mathbb{B}^3 and \mathbb{B}^4, including some new families of free boundary minimal annuli and M\"obius bands in \mathbb{B}^4. Finally, we prove that these are the only S^1-invariant free boundary minimal annuli and M\"obius bands in \mathbb{B}^n.
