We review and provide simplified proofs related to the Magnus expansion, and improve convergence estimates. Observations and improvements concerning the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff expansion are also made. In this Part II, we prove growth estimates regarding the Magnus expansion in the setting Hilbert space operators near the critical cumulative norm \pi. We also conduct a detailed geometrical study in the case of 2\times2 real matrices, leading to some special normal forms via the Magnus expansion.
