The minimal operator and the maximal operator of an elliptic pseudo-differential operator with symbols on \Z^n\times \mathbb{T}^n are proved to coincide and the domain is given in terms of a Sobolev space. Ellipticity and Fredholmness are proved to be equivalent for pseudo-differential operators on \Z^n. The index of an elliptic pseudo-differential operator on \Z^n is also computed.
