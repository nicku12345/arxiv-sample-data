We study spectral properties of bounded and unbounded complex Jacobi matrices. In particular, we formulate conditions assuring that the spectrum of the studied operators is continuous on some subsets of the complex plane and we provide uniform asymptotics of their generalised eigenvectors. We illustrate our results by considering complex perturbations of real Jacobi matrices belonging to several classes: asymptotically periodic, periodically modulated and the blend of these two. Moreover, we provide conditions implying existence of a unique closed extension. The method of the proof is based on the analysis of a generalisation of shifted Tur\'an determinants to the complex setting.
