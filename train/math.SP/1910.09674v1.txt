The complex Green operator \mathcal{G} on CR manifolds is the inverse of the Kohn-Laplacian \square_b on the orthogonal complement of its kernel. In this note, we prove Schatten and Sobolev estimates for \mathcal{G} on the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^{2n-1}\subset \mathbb{C}^n. We obtain these estimates by using the spectrum of \square_b and the asymptotics of the eigenvalues of the usual Laplace-Beltrami operator.
