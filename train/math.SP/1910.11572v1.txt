We consider the buckling eigenvalue problem for a clamped plate in the annulus. We identify the first eigenvalue in dependence of the inner radius, and study the number of nodal domains of the corresponding eigenfunctions. Moreover, in order to investigate the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions as the inner radius approaches the outer one, we provide an analytical study of the buckling problem in rectangles with mixed boundary conditions.
