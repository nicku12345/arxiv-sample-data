We continue our exploration of the extent to which the spectrum encodes the local geometry of a locally homogeneous three-manifold and find that if (M,g) and (N,h) are a pair of locally homogeneous, locally non-isometric isospectral three-manifolds, where M is an elliptic three-manifold, then (1) N is also an elliptic three-manifold, (2) M and N have fundamental groups of different orders, (3) (M,g) and (N,h) both have non-degenerate Ricci tensors and (4) the metrics g and h are sufficiently far from a metric of constant sectional curvature. We are unaware of any such isospectral pair and such a pair could not arise via the classical Sunada method. As part of the proof, we provide an explicit description of the isometry group of a compact simple Lie group equipped with a left-invariant metric---improving upon the results of Ochiai-Takahashi and Onishchik---which we use to classify the locally homogeneous metrics on an elliptic three-manifold \Gamma \backslash S^3 and we determine that any collection of isospectral locally homogeneous metrics on an elliptic three-manifold consists of at most two isometry classes that are necessarily locally isometric. In particular, the left-invariant metrics on \operatorname{SO}(3) (respectively, S^3) can be mutually distinguished via their spectra. The previous statement has the following interpretation in terms of physical chemistry: the moments of inertia of a molecule can be recovered from its rotational spectrum.
