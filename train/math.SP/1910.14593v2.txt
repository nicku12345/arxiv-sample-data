We consider the problem of minimising or maximising the quantity \lambda(\O)T^q(\O) on the class of open sets of prescribed Lebesgue measure. Here q>0 is fixed, \lambda(\O) denotes the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian on H^1_0(\O), while T(\O) is the torsional rigidity of \O. The optimisation problem above is considered in the class of {\it all domains} \O, in the class of {\it convex domains} \O, and in the class of {\it thin domains}. The full Blaschke-Santal\'o diagram for \lambda(\O) and T(\O) is obtained in dimension one, while for higher dimensions we provide some bounds.
