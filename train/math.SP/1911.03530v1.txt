It is well known that for a single bounded operator A_0 on a Hilbert \mathfrak{H}, if \mathfrak{M}\subset \mathfrak{H} is hyperinvariant for A_0, then the spectrum of A_0|_{\mathfrak{M}} is contained in the spectrum of A_0. In this note, we modify an example of Taylor to prove the following. There exist a quadruple A=(A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4) of commuting bounded Hilbert space operators and a hyperinvariant subspace \mathfrak{X}_1 for A such that the Taylor joint spectrum of A restricted to \mathfrak{X}_1 is a not a subset of the Taylor joint spectrum of A.
