This paper shows that for the domain intersection \dom T\cap\dom T^* of a closed linear operator and its Hilbert space adjoint everything is possible for very common classes of operators with non-empty resolvent set. Apart from the most striking case of a maximal sectorial operator with \dom T\cap\dom T^*=\{0\}, we construct classes of operators for which \dim(\dom T\cap\dom T^*)= n \in \dN_0; \dim(\dom T\cap\dom T^*)= \infty and at the same time \codim(\dom T\cap\dom T^*)=\infty; and \codim(\dom T\cap\dom T^*)= n \in \dN_0; the latter includes~the case that \dom T\cap\dom T^* is dense but no core of T and T^* and the case \dom T=\dom T^* for non-normal T. We also show that all these possibilities may occur for operators T with non-empty resolvent set such that either W(T)=\dC, T is maximal accretive but not sectorial, or T is even maximal sectorial. Moreover, in all but one subcase T can be chosen with compact resolvent.
