This paper studies the effects of the dispersal spread, which characterizes the dispersal range, on nonlocal diffusion equations with the nonlocal dispersal operator \frac{1}{\sigma^{m}}\int_{\Omega}J_{\sigma}(x-y)(u(y,t)-u(x,t))dy and Neumann boundary condition in the spatial heterogeneity environment. More precisely, we are mainly concerned with asymptotic behaviors of generalised principal eigenvalue to the nonlocal dispersal operator, positive stationary solutions and solutions to the nonlocal diffusion KPP equation in both large and small dispersal spread. For large dispersal spread, we show that their asymptotic behaviors are unitary with respect to the cost parameter m\in[0,\infty). However, small dispersal spread can lead to different asymptotic behaviors as the cost parameter m is in a different range. In particular, for the case m=0, we should point out that asymptotic properties for the nonlocal diffusion equation with Neumann boundary condition are different from those for the nonlocal diffusion equation with Dirichlet boundary condition.
