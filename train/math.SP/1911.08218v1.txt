Four new examples of explicitly diagonalizable Hankel matrices depending on a parameter k\in(0,1) are presented. The Hankel matrices are regarded as matrix operators on the Hilbert space \ell^{2}(\mathbb{N}_{0}) and the solution of the spectral problem is based on an application of the commutator method. Each of the Hankel matrices commutes with a Jacobi matrix which is related to a particular family of the Stieltjes-Carlitz polynomials. More examples of explicitly diagonalizable structured matrix operators are obtained when taking into account also weighted Hankel matrices.
