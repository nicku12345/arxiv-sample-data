The edge-connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges whose deletion disconnects the graph. Let \Delta(G) the maximum degree of a graph G and let \rho(G) be the spectral radius of G. In this article we present a lower bound for \Delta(G)-\rho(G) in terms of the edge connectivity of G, where G is a nonregular distance-hereditary graph. We also prove that \rho(G) reaches the maximum at a unique graph in \mathcal G, when \vert V(G)\vert = n, and \mathcal G either is in the class of graphs with bounded tree-width or is in the class of block graphs with prescribed independence number.
