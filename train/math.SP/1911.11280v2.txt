Let \mu be a measure from Szeg\H{o} class on the unit circle \mathbb T and let \{f_n\} be the family of Schur functions generated by \mu. In this paper, we prove a version of the classical Szeg\H{o}'s formula which controls the oscillation of f_n on \mathbb T for all n \ge 0. Then, we focus on an analog of Lusin's conjecture for polynomials \{\varphi_n\} orthogonal with respect to measure \mu and prove that pointwise convergence of \{|\varphi_n|\} almost everywhere on \mathbb T is equivalent to a certain condition on zeroes of \varphi_n.
