We study the dependence of the first eigenvalue of the Finsler p-Laplacian and the corresponding eigenfunctions upon perturbation of the domain and we generalize a few results known for the standard p-Laplacian. In particular, we prove a Frech\'{e}t differentiability result for the eigenvalues, we compute the corresponding Hadamard formulas and we prove a continuity result for the eigenfunctions. Finally, we briefly discuss a well-known overdetermined problem and we show how to deduce the Rellich-Pohozaev identity for the Finsler p-Laplacian from the Hadamard formula.
