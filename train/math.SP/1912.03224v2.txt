In this paper, we study energies associated with hypergraphs. More precisely, we obtain results for the incidence and the singless Laplacian energies of uniform hypergraphs. In particular, we obtain bounds for the incidence energy as functions of well known parameters, such as maximum degree, Zagreb index and spectral radius. We also relate the incidence and signless Laplacian energies of a hypergraph with the adjacency energies of its subdivision graph and line multigraph, respectively. In addition, we compute the signless Laplacian energy for the class of the power hypergraphs.
