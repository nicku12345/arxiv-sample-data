We work with the Schr\" odinger equation \begin{equation*} H_q y = -y'' + q(x)y = z^2y, \ x\in [0,\infty), \end{equation*} where q\in L_1((0,\infty), xdx), and asssume that the corresponding operator H_q is defined by the Dirihlet condition y(0) = 0 The function \psi(z) = y(0,z) where y(x,z) is the Jost solution of the above equation is analytic in the whole complex plane, provided that the support of the potential q is finite. The zeros of \psi are called the resonances. It is known that q is uniquely determined by the sequence of resonances. Using only finitely many resonances lying in the disk |z|\le r we can recover the potential q with accuracy \varepsilon(r)\to 0 as r \to \infty. The main result of the paper is the estimate \varepsilon(r) \le Cr^{-\alpha} with some constants C and \alpha>0 which are defined by a priori information about the potential q.
