We present upper estimates for the number of negative eigenvalues of two-dimensional Schroedinger operators with potentials generated by Ahlfors regular measures of arbitrary dimension \alpha\in (0, 2].The estimates are given in terms of the integrals of the potential with a logarithmic weight and of its L \log L type Orlicz norms. In the case \alpha = 1, our estimates are stronger than the known ones about Schroedinger operators with potentials supported by Lipschitz curves.
