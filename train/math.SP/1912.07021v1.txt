We consider the nonlinear eigenvalue problem Lx + \varepsilon N(x) = \lambda Cx, \|x\|=1, where \varepsilon,\lambda are real parameters, L, C\colon G \to H are bounded linear operators between separable real Hilbert spaces, and N\colon S \to H is a continuous map defined on the unit sphere of G. We prove a global persistence result regarding the set \Sigma of the solutions (x,\varepsilon,\lambda) \in S \times \mathbb R\times \mathbb R of this problem. Namely, if the operators N and C are compact, under suitable assumptions on a solution p_*=(x_*,0,\lambda_*) of the unperturbed problem, we prove that the connected component of \Sigma containing p_* is either unbounded or meets a triple p^*=(x^*,0,\lambda^*) with p^* \not= p_*. When C is the identity and G=H is finite dimensional, the assumptions on (x_*,0,\lambda_*) mean that x_* is an eigenvector of L whose corresponding eigenvalue \lambda_* is simple. Therefore, we extend a previous result obtained by the authors in the finite dimensional setting. Our work is inspired by a paper of R. Chiappinelli concerning the local persistence property of the unit eigenvectors of perturbed self-adjoint operators in a real Hilbert space.
