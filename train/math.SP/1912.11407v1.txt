In this paper. we study properties such as L^r-boundedness, compactness, belonging to Schatten classes and nuclearity, Riesz spectral theory, Fredholmness, ellipticity and Gohberg's lemma, among others, for pseudo-differential operators over the compact group of p-adic integers \mathbb{Z}_p^d, where the author in a recent paper introduced a notion of H\"ormander classes and pseudo-differential calculus. We extend the results to compact Vilenkin groups which are essentially the same as \mathbb{Z}_p^d. Also, we provide a new definition of H\"ormander classes for pseudo-differential operators acting on non-compact Vilenkin groups and an explicit formula for the Fredholm spectrum in terms of the associated symbol.
