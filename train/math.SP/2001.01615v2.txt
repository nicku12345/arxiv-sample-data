Given a connected set \Omega_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^2, define a sequence of sets (\Omega_n)_{n=0}^{\infty} where \Omega_{n+1} is the subset of \Omega_n where the first eigenfunction of the (properly normalized) Neumann p-Laplacian  -\Delta^{(p)} \phi = \lambda_1 |\phi|^{p-2} \phi is positive (or negative). For p=1, this is also referred to as the Ratio Cut of the domain. We conjecture that, unless \Omega_0 is an isosceles right triangle, these sets converge to the set of rectangles with eccentricity bounded by 2 in the Gromov-Hausdorff distance as long as they have a certain distance to the boundary \partial \Omega_0. We establish some aspects of this conjecture for p=1 where we prove that (1) the 1-Laplacian spectral cut of domains sufficiently close to rectangles of a given aspect ratio is a circular arc that is closer to flat than the original domain (leading eventually to quadrilaterals) and (2) quadrilaterals close to a rectangle of aspect ratio 2 stay close to quadrilaterals and move closer to rectangles in a suitable metric. We also discuss some numerical aspects and pose many open questions.
