Let \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n be a bounded C^1 domain and p>1. For \alpha>0, define the quantity \[ \Lambda(\alpha)=\inf_{u\in W^{1,p}(\Omega),\, u\not\equiv 0} \Big(\int_\Omega |\nabla u|^p\,\mathrm{d}x - \alpha \int_{\partial\Omega} |u|^p \,\mathrm{d} s\Big)\Big/ \int_\Omega |u|^p\,\mathrm{d} x \] with \mathrm{d} s being the hypersurface measure, which is the lowest eigenvalue of the p-laplacian in \Omega with a non-linear \alpha-dependent Robin boundary condition. We show the asymptotics \Lambda(\alpha) =(1-p)\alpha^{p/(p-1)}+o(\alpha^{p/(p-1)}) as \alpha tends to +\infty. The result was only known for the linear case p=2 or under stronger smoothness assumptions. Our proof is much shorter and is based on completely different and elementary arguments, and it allows for an improved remainder estimate for C^{1,\lambda} domains.
