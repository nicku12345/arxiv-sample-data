Bounds on the product of the principal eigenvalue and L^\infty norm of the torsion function of Brownian motion that are uniform over a given class of domains D\subset\mathbb{R}^d have been a topic of active research with several improvements and conjectures appearing in the literature recently. In particular, a result of H. Vogt (2019) gives an explicit upper bound that is valid for all open sets with positive principal eigenvalue and is sharp up to leading order for large d. In this paper, we use Vogt's result to derive an analogous bound for the symmetric stable processes which captures the correct order of growth in d, improving upon the existing result of Giorgi and Smits (2010). Along the way, we prove a torsion analogue of Chen and Song's (2005) two-sided eigenvalue estimates for subordinate Brownian motion, which may be of independent interest.
