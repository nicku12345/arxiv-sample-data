In this work we analyse the functional {\cal J}(u)=\|\nabla u\|_\infty defined on Lipschitz functions with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our analysis is performed directly on the functional without the need to approximate with smooth p-norms. We prove that its ground states coincide with multiples of the distance function to the boundary of the domain. Furthermore, we compute the L^2-subdifferential of {\cal J} and characterize the distance function as unique non-negative eigenfunction of the subdifferential operator. We also study properties of general eigenfunctions, in particular their nodal sets. Furthermore, we prove that the distance function can be computed as asymptotic profile of the gradient flow of {\cal J} and construct analytic solutions of fast marching type. In addition, we give a geometric characterization of the extreme points of the unit ball of {\cal J}.   Finally, we transfer many of these results to a discrete version of the functional defined on a finite weighted graph. Here, we analyze properties of distance functions on graphs and their gradients. The main difference between the continuum and discrete setting is that the distance function is not the unique non-negative eigenfunction on a graph.
