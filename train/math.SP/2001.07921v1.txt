We prove several results of concentration for eigenfunctions in Toeplitz quantization. With mild assumptions on the regularity, we prove that eigenfunctions are O(exp(-cN^{\delta})) away from the corresponding level set of the symbol, where N is the inverse semiclassical parameter and 0 < \delta < 1 depends on the regularity. As an application, we prove a precise bound for the free energy of spin systems at high temperatures, sharpening a result of Lieb.
