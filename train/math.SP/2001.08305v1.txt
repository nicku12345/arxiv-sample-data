In this paper we will extend to non-abelian groups inverse spectral results, proved by us in an earlier paper, for compact abelian groups, i.e. tori. More precisely, Let \mathsf G be a compact Lie group acting isometrically on a compact Riemannian manifold X. We will show that for the Schr\"odinger operator -\hbar^2 \Delta+V with V \in C^\infty(X)^{\mathsf G}, the potential function V is, in some interesting examples, determined by the \mathsf G-equivariant spectrum. The key ingredient in this proof is a generalized Legendrian relation between the Lagrangian manifolds \mathrm{Graph}(dV) and \mathrm{Graph}(dF), where F is a spectral invariant defined on an open subset of the positive Weyl chamber.
