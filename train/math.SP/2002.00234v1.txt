We consider semiclassical self-adjoint operators whose symbol, defined on a two-dimensional symplectic manifold, reaches a non-degenerate minimum b_0 on a closed curve. We derive a classical and quantum normal form which allows us, in addition to the complete integrability of the system, to obtain eigenvalue asymptotics in a window (-\infty,b_0+\epsilon] for \epsilon > 0 independent on the semiclassical parameter. These asymptotics are obtained in two complementary settings: either a symmetry of the system under translation along the curve, or a Morse hypothesis reminiscent of Helffer-Sj\"ostrand's "miniwell" situation.
