The perturbation of the Sturm-Liouville operator on a finite interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions by a convolution operator is considered. Local stability and global unique solvability of the inverse problem of recovering the convolution kernel from the spectrum, provided that the potential is given a priori, is known. In the present work, we establish uniform full stability of this inverse problem involving a uniform estimate of deviations of the convolution kernel via deviations of the spectrum and the potential within balls of any fixed radii.
