We prove a sharp H\"ormander multiplier theorem for Schr\"odinger operators H=-\Delta+V on \mathbb{R}^n. The result is obtained under certain condition on a weighted L^\infty estimate, coupled with a weighted L^2 estimate for H, which is a weaker condition than that for nonnegative operators via the heat kernel approach. Our approach is elaborated in one dimension with potential V belonging to certain critical weighted L^1 class. Namely, we assume that \int (1+|x|) |V(x)|dx is finite and H has no resonance at zero. In the resonance case we assume \int (1+|x|^2) |V(x)| dx is finite.
