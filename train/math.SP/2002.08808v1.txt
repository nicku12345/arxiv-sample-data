We give a characterization {\sl \`a la Obata} for certain families of K\''ahler manifolds. These results are in the same line as other extensions of the well-known Obata's rigidity theorem from \cite{Obata62}, like for instance the generalizations in \cite{RanjSant97} and \cite{Santhanam07}. Moreover, we give a complete description of the so-called K\''ahler doubly-warped product structures whose underlying metric is Einstein.
