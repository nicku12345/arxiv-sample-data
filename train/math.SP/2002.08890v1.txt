We characterize the spectrum of the Laplacian of graphs composed of one or two finite or infinite chains connected to a complete graph. We show the existence of localized eigenvectors of two types, eigenvectors that vanish exactly outside the complete graph and eigenvectors that decrease exponentially outside the complete graph. Our results also imply gaps between the eigenvalues corresponding to localized and extended eigenvectors.
