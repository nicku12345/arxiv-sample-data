We establish spectral inclusion and mapping theorems for scalar type spectral operators and thereby extend a weak spectral mapping theorem and a generalized Lyapunov stability theorem, known to hold for the C_0-semigroups of normal operators on complex Hilbert spaces, to the more general case of C_0-semigroups of scalar type spectral operators on complex Banach spaces. For such semigroups, we also obtain a spectral mapping theorem for point spectrum, exponential estimates, and an analogue of the Gearhart-Pr\"uss-Greiner characterization of the uniform exponential stability for C_0-semigroups on complex Hilbert spaces.
