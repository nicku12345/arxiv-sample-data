For a given graph \mathcal{G} of order n with m edges, and a real symmetric matrix associated to the graph, M\left(\mathcal{G}\right)\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}, the interlacing graph reduction problem is to find a graph \mathcal{G}_{r} of order r<n such that the eigenvalues of M\left(\mathcal{G}_{r}\right) interlace the eigenvalues of M\left(\mathcal{G}\right). Graph contractions over partitions of the vertices are widely used as a combinatorial graph reduction tool. In this study, we derive a graph reduction interlacing theorem based on subspace mappings and the minmax theory. We then define a class of edge-matching graph contractions and show how two types of edge-matching contractions provide Laplacian and normalized Laplacian interlacing. An \mathcal{O}\left(mn\right) algorithm is provided for finding a normalized Laplacian interlacing contraction and an \mathcal{O}\left(n^{2}+nm\right) algorithm is provided for finding a Laplacian interlacing contraction.
