The paper is concerned with the maximization of Laplace eigenvalues on surfaces of given volume with a Riemannian metric in a fixed conformal class. A significant progress on this problem has been recently achieved by Nadirashvili-Sire and Petrides using related, though different methods. In particular, it was shown that for a given k, the maximum of the k-th Laplace eigenvalue in a conformal class on a surface is either attained on a metric which is smooth except possibly at a finite number of conical singularities, or it is attained in the limit while a "bubble tree" is formed on a surface. Geometrically, the bubble tree appearing in this setting can be viewed as a union of touching identical round spheres. We present another proof of this statement, developing the approach proposed by the second author and Y. Sire. As a side result, we provide explicit upper bounds on the topological spectrum of surfaces.
