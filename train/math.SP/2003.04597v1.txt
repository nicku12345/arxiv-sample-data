This work concerns L^p norms of high energy Laplace eigenfunctions, (-\Delta_g-\lambda^2)\phi_\lambda=0, \|\phi_\lambda\|_{L^2}=1. In 1988, Sogge gave optimal estimates on the growth of \|\phi_\lambda\|_{L^p} for a general compact Riemannian manifold. The goal of this article is to give general dynamical conditions guaranteeing quantitative improvements in L^p estimates for p>p_c, where p_c is the critical exponent. We also apply dynamical results of the authors to obtain quantitative improvements in concrete geometric settings. These are the first results improving estimates for the L^p growth of eigenfunctions that only require dynamical assumptions. In contrast with previous improvements, our assumptions are local in the sense that they depend only on the geodesics passing through a shrinking neighborhood of a given set in M.   Our method departs from the standard approach for treating L^p norms in two substantial ways. It hinges on adapting the geodesic beam techniques previously developed by the authors, avoiding the necessity for long-time wave parametrices, and requires the development of a new second-microlocal calculus. This calculus allows for effective control on the number of points at which an eigenfunction can have large L^\infty norm. This involves a delicate microlocal argument which yields an uncertainty principle that gives quantitative estimates on the L^2 mass shared along short geodesics connecting two nearby points; with effective bounds as the points approach one another.
