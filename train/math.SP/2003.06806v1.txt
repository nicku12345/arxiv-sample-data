Extremal problems concerning the number of complete subgraphs have a long story in extremal graph theory. Let k_s(G) be the number of s-cliques in a graph G and m={{r_m}\choose s}+t_m, where 0\le t_m\leq r_m. Edr\H{o}s showed that k_s(G)\le {{r_m}\choose s}+{{t_m}\choose{s-1}} over all graphs of size m and order n\geq r_m+1. %Clearly, K_{r_m}^{t_m}\cup (n-r_m-1)K_1 is an extremal graph, where K_{r_m}^{t_m} is the graph by joining a new vertex to t_m vertices of K_{r_m}. It is natural to consider an improvement in connected situation: what is the maximum number of s-cliques over all connected graphs of size m and order n? In this paper, the sharp upper bound of k_s(G) is obtained and extremal graphs are completely characterized. The technique and the bound are different from those in general case. As an application, this result can be used to solve a question on spectral moment.
