For Riemannian submersions with fibers of basic mean curvature, we compare the spectrum of the total space with the spectrum of a Schr\"{o}dinger operator on the base manifold. Exploiting this concept, we study submersions arising from actions of Lie groups. In this context, we extend the state of the art results on the bottom of the spectrum under Riemannian coverings. As an application, we compute the bottom of the spectrum and the Cheeger constant of connected, amenable Lie groups.
