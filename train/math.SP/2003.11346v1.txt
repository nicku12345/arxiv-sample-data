For \alpha > 0 we consider the operator K_\alpha \colon \ell^2 \to \ell^2 corresponding to the matrix \[\left(\frac{(nm)^{-\frac{1}{2}+\alpha}}{[\max(n,m)]^{2\alpha}}\right)_{n,m=1}^\infty.\] By interpreting K_\alpha as the inverse of an unbounded Jacobi matrix, we show that the absolutely continuous spectrum coincides with [0, 2/\alpha] (multiplicity one), and that there is no singular continuous spectrum. There are a finite number of eigenvalues above the continuous spectrum. We apply our results to demonstrate that the reproducing kernel thesis does not hold for composition operators on the Hardy space of Dirichlet series \mathscr{H}^2.
