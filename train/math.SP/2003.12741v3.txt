We show that a Hilbert space bounded linear operator has an m-isometric lifting for some integer m\ge 1 if and only if the norms of its powers grow polynomially. In analogy with unitary dilations of contractions, we prove that such operators also have an invertible m-isometric dilation. We also study 2-isometric liftings of convex operators and 3-isometric liftings of Foguel-Hankel operators.
