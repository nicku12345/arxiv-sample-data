This is a survey of accumulated spectral analysis observations spanning more than a century, referring to the double layer potential integral equation, also known as Neumann-Poincar\'e operator. The very notion of spectral analysis has evolved along this path. Indeed, the quest for solving this specific singular integral equation, originally aimed at elucidating classical potential theory problems, has inspired and shaped the development of theoretical spectral analysis of linear transforms in XX-th century. We briefly touch some marking discoveries into the subject, with ample bibliographical references to both old, sometimes forgotten, texts and new contributions. It is remarkable that applications of the spectral analysis of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator are still uncovered nowadays, with spectacular impacts on applied science. A few modern ramifications along these lines are depicted in our survey.
