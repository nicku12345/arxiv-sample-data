The k-parallel subdivision graph S_k(G) is generated from G which each edge of G is replaced by k parallel paths of length 2. The 2k-parallel subdivision graph S_{2k}(G) is constructed from G which each edge of G is replaced by k parallel paths of length 3. In this paper, the normalized Laplacian spectra of S_k(G) and S_{2k}(G) are given. They turn out that the multiplicities of the corresponding eigenvalues are only determined by k. As applications, the expected hitting time, the expected commute time and any two-points resistance distance between vertices i and j of S_k(G), the normalized Laplacian spectra of S_k(G) and S_{2k}(G) with r iterations are given. Moreover, the multiplicative degree Kirchhoff index, Kemeny's constant and the number of spanning tress of S_k(G), S_k^r(G), S_{2k}(G) and S_{2k}^r(G) are respectively obtained. Our results have generalized the previous works in Xie et al. and Guo et al. respectively.
