We investigate minimal operator corresponding to operator differential expression with exit from space, study its selfadjoint extensions, also for one particular selfadjoint extension corresponding to boundary value problem with some rational function of eigenparameter in boundary condition establish asymptotics of spectrum and derive trace formula
