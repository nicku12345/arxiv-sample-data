Gajic--Warnick have recently proposed a definition of scattering resonances based on Gevrey-2 regularity at infinity and introduced a new class of potentials for which resonances can be defined. We show that standard methods based on complex scaling apply to a slightly larger class of potentials and show existence of resonances in larger angles.
