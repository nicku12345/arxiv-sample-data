Let G=(V,E) be a connected graph, where V=\{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n\} and m=|E|. d_i will denote the degree of vertex v_i of G, and \Delta=\max_{1\leq i \leq n} d_i. The ABC matrix of G is defined as M(G)=(m_{ij})_{n \times n}, where m_{ij}=\sqrt{(d_i + d_j -2)/(d_i d_j)} if v_i v_j \in E, and 0 otherwise. The largest eigenvalue of M(G) is called the ABC spectral radius of G, denoted by \rho_{ABC}(G). Recently, this graph invariant has attracted some attentions. We prove that \rho_{ABC}(G) \leq \sqrt{\Delta+(2m-n+1)/\Delta -2}. As an application, the unique tree with n \geq 4 vertices having second largest ABC spectral radius is determined.
