We consider a wide class of the two-particle Schr\"{o}dinger operators H_{\mu}(k)=H_{0}(k)+\mu V, \,\mu>0, with a fixed two-particle quasi-momentum k in the d -dimensional torus \mathbb{T}^d, associated to the Bose-Hubbard hamiltonian H_{\mu} of a system of two identical quantum-mechanical particles (bosons) on the d- dimensional hypercubic lattice \mathbb{Z}% ^d interacting via short-range pair potentials. We study the existence of eigenvalues of H_{\mu}(k) below the threshold of the essential spectrum depending on the interaction energy \mu>0 and the quasi-momentum k\in \mathbb{T}^d of particles. We prove that the threshold (bottom of the essential spectrum), as a singular point (a threshold resonance or a threshold eigenvalue), creates eigenvalues below the essential spectrum under perturbations of both the coupling constant \mu>0 and the quasi-momentum k of the particles. Moreover, we show that if the threshold is a regular point, then it does not create any eigenvalues under small perturbations of the coupling constant \mu>0 and the quasi-momentum k.
