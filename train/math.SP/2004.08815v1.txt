We study the existence of eigenvalues of the generalized Friedrichs model H_\mu(p), with a rank-one perturbation, depending on parameters \mu>0 and p\in\mathbb{T}^2, and found an absolutely convergent expansions for eigenvalues at \mu(p), the coupling constant threshold. The expansions are highly dependent on that, whether the threshold m(p) of the essential spectrum is: (i) neither an threshold eigenvalue nor a threshold resonance; (ii) a threshold resonance; (iii) an threshold eigenvalue.
