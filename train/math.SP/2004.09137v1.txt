In this paper we study spectral properties of Schr\"odinger operators with quasi-periodic potentials related to quasi-periodic action minimizing trajectories for analytic twist maps. We prove that the spectrum contains a component of absolutely continuous spectrum provided that the corresponding trajectory of the twist map belongs to an analytic invariant curve.
