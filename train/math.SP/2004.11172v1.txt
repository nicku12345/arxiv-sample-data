We generalize the concepts of D-stability and additive D-stability of matrices. For this, we consider a family of unbounded regions defined in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (so-called LMI regions). We study the problem when the localization of a matrix spectrum in an unbounded LMI region is preserved under specific multiplicative and additive perturbations of the initial matrix. The most well-known particular cases of unbounded LMI regions (namely, conic sectors and shifted halfplanes) are considered. A new D-stability criterion as well as sufficient conditions for generalized D-stability are analyzed. Several applications of the developed theory to dynamical systems are shown.
