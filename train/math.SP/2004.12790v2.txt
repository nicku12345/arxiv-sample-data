A new method to enclose the pseudospectrum via the numerical range of the inverse of a matrix or linear operator is presented. The method is applied to finite-dimensional discretizations of an operator on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and convergence results for different approximation schemes are obtained, including finite element methods. We show that the pseudospectrum of the full operator is contained in an intersection of sets which are expressed in terms of the numerical ranges of shifted inverses of the approximating matrices. The results are illustrated by means of two examples: the advection-diffusion operator and the Hain-L\"ust operator.
