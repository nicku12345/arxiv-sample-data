A sum rule is an identity connecting the entropy of a measure with coefficients involved in the construction of its orthogonal polynomials (Jacobi coefficients). Our paper is an extension of Gamboa, Nagel and Rouault (2016), where we have showed sum rules by using only probabilistic tools (namely the large deviations theory). Here, we prove large deviation principles for the weighted spectral measure of unitarily invariant random matrices in two general situations: firstly, when the equilibrium measure is not necessarily supported by a single interval and secondly, when the potential is a nonnegative polynomial. The rate functions can be expressed as functions of the Jacobi coefficients. These new large deviation results lead to original sum rules both for the one and the multi-cut regime and also answer a conjecture stated in Gamboa, Nagel and Rouault (2016) concerning general sum rules.
