Let \Sigma be a compact surface with boundary. For a given conformal class c on \Sigma the functional \sigma_k^*(\Sigma,c) is defined as the supremum of the k-th normalized Steklov eigenvalue over all metrics on c. We consider the behaviour of this functional on the moduli space of conformal classes on \Sigma. A precise formula for the limit of \sigma_k^*(\Sigma,c_n) when the sequence \{c_n\} degenerates is obtained. We apply this formula to the study of natural analogs of the Friedlander-Nadirashvili invariants of closed manifolds defined as \inf_{c}\sigma_k^*(\Sigma,c), where the infimum is taken over all conformal classes c on \Sigma. We show that these quantities are equal to 2\pi k for any surface with boundary. As an application of our techniques we obtain new estimates on the k-th normalized Steklov eigenvalue of a non-orientable surface in terms of its genus and the number of boundary components.
