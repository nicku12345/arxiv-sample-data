Several new spectral properties of the normalized Laplacian defined for oriented hypergraphs are shown. The eigenvalue 1 and the case of duplicate vertices are discussed; two Courant nodal domain theorems are established; new quantities that bound the eigenvalues are introduced. In particular, the Cheeger constant is generalized and it is shown that the classical Cheeger bounds can be generalized for some classes of hypergraphs; it is shown that a geometric quantity used to study zonotopes bounds the largest eigenvalue from below, and that the notion of coloring number can be generalized and used for proving a Hoffman-like bound. Finally, the spectrum of the unnormalized Laplacian for Cartesian products of hypergraphs is discussed.
