In this paper, we study the entries of the principal eigenvector of the signless Laplacian matrix of a hypergraph. More precisely, we obtain bounds for this entries. These bounds are computed trough other important parameters, such as spectral radius, maximum and minimum degree. We also introduce and study a new parameter related to edges of the hypergraph. This parameter is a spectral measure of a structural characteristic that can be thought of as an edge-variant of regularity.
