We introduce an abstract framework for the study of clustering in metric graphs: after suitably metrising the space of graph partitions, we restrict Laplacians to the clusters thus arising and use their spectral gaps to define several notions of partition energies; this is the graph counterpart of the well-known theory of spectral minimal partitions on planar domains and includes the setting in [Band \textit{et al}, Comm.\ Math.\ Phys.\ \textbf{311} (2012), 815--838] as a special case. We focus on the existence of optimisers for a large class of functionals defined on such partitions, but also study their qualitative properties, including stability, regularity, and parameter dependence. We also discuss in detail their interplay with the theory of nodal partitions. Unlike in the case of domains, the one-dimensional setting of metric graphs allows for explicit computation and analytic -- rather than numerical -- results. Not only do we recover the main assertions in the theory of spectral minimal partitions on domains, as studied in [Conti \textit{et al}, Calc.\ Var.\ \textbf{22} (2005), 45--72; Helffer \textit{et al}, Ann.\ Inst.\ Henri Poincar\'e Anal.\ Non Lin\'eaire \textbf{26} (2009), 101--138], but we can also generalise some of them and answer (the graph counterparts of) a few open questions.
