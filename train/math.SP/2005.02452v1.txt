We consider the Karpelevi\v{c} region \Theta_n \subset \mathbb{C} consisting of all eigenvalues of all stochastic matrices of order n. We provide an alternative characterisation of \Theta_n that sharpens the original description given by Karpelevi\v{c}. In particular, for each \theta \in [0, 2\pi), we identify the point on the boundary of \Theta_n with argument \theta. We further prove that if n \in \mathbb{N} with n \ge 2, and t \in \Theta_n, then t is a subdominant eigenvalue of some stochastic matrix of order n.
