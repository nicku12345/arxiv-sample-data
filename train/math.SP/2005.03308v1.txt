Let \Gamma be a discrete group acting properly discontinuously and isometrically on the three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space \mathrm{AdS}^{3}, and \square the Laplacian which is a second-order hyperbolic differential operator. We study linear independence of a family of generalized Poincar\'{e} series introduced by Kassel-Kobayashi [Adv. Math. 2016], which are defined by the \Gamma-average of certain eigenfunctions on \mathrm{AdS}^{3}. We prove that the multiplicities of L^{2}-eigenvalues of the hyperbolic Laplacian \square on \Gamma\backslash\mathrm{AdS}^{3} are unbounded when \Gamma is finitely generated. Moreover, we prove that the multiplicities of \textit{stable L^{2}-eigenvalues} for compact anti-de Sitter 3-manifolds are unbounded.
