We develop subordinacy theory for extended CMV matrices. That is, we provide explicit supports for the singular and absolutely continuous parts of the canonical spectral measure associated with a given extended CMV matrix in terms of the presence or absence of subordinate solutions of the generalized eigenvalue equation. Some corollaries and applications of this result are described as well.
