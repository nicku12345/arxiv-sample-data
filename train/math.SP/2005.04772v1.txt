Let \Omega \subset \mathbb R^3 be a waveguide which is obtained by translating a cross-section in a constant direction along an unbounded spatial curve. Consider -\Delta_{\Omega}^D the Dirichlet Laplacian operator in \Omega. Under the condition that the tangent vector of the reference curve admits a finite limit at infinity, we find the essential spectrum of -\Delta_{\Omega}^D. Then, we state sufficient conditions that give rise to a non-empty discrete spectrum for -\Delta_{\Omega}^D; in particular, we show that the number of discrete eigenvalues can be arbitrarily large since the waveguide is thin enough.
