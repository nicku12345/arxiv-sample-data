We consider the torsion function for the Dirichlet Laplacian -\Delta, and for the Schr\"odinger operator - \Delta + V on an open set \Omega\subset \R^m, with Lebesgue measure 0<|\Omega|<\infty, with a real-valued, non-negative, measurable potential V. We investigate the phenomena of vanishing efficiency and localisation, and large efficiency for the torsion function and the first Dirichlet eigenfunction.
