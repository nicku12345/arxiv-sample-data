A \mathbb{T}-gain graph, \Phi = (G, \varphi), is a graph in which the function \varphi assigns a unit complex number to each orientation of an edge, and its inverse is assigned to the opposite orientation. The associated adjacency matrix  A(\Phi)  is defined canonically. The energy  \mathcal{E}(\Phi)  of a  \mathbb{T} -gain graph  \Phi  is the sum of the absolute values of all eigenvalues of  A(\Phi) .   We study the notion of energy of a vertex of a  \mathbb{T} -gain graph, and establish bounds for it. For any  \mathbb{T} -gain graph  \Phi, we prove that 2\tau(G)-2c(G) \leq \mathcal{E}(\Phi) \leq 2\tau(G)\sqrt{\Delta(G)}, where  \tau(G), c(G) and  \Delta(G) are the vertex cover number, the number of odd cycles and the largest vertex degree of  G , respectively. Furthermore, using the properties of vertex energy, we characterize the classes of  \mathbb{T} -gain graphs for which  \mathcal{E}(\Phi)=2\tau(G)-2c(G)  holds. Also, we characterize the classes of  \mathbb{T} -gain graphs for which \mathcal{E}(\Phi)= 2\tau(G)\sqrt{\Delta(G)}  holds. This characterization solves a general version of an open problem. In addition, we establish bounds for the energy in terms of the spectral radius of the associated adjacency matrix.
