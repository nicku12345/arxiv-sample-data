We consider the family of Hecke triangle groups  \Gamma_{w} = \langle S, T_w\rangle  generated by the M\"obius transformations  S : z\mapsto -1/z  and  T_{w} : z \mapsto z+w  with  w > 2. In this case the corresponding hyperbolic quotient  \Gamma_{w}\backslash\mathbb{H}^2  is an infinite-area orbifold. Moreover, the limit set of  \Gamma_w  is a Cantor-like fractal whose Hausdorff dimension we denote by  \delta(w).  The first result of this paper asserts that the twisted Selberg zeta function  Z_{\Gamma_{ w}}(s, \rho) , where  \rho : \Gamma_{w} \to \mathrm{U}(V)  is an arbitrary finite-dimensional unitary representation, can be realized as the Fredholm determinant of a Mayer-type transfer operator. This result has a number of applications. We study the distribution of the zeros in the half-plane \mathrm{Re}(s) > \frac{1}{2} of the Selberg zeta function of a special family of subgroups ( \Gamma_w^n )_{n\in \mathbb{N}}  of \Gamma_w. These zeros correspond to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on the associated hyperbolic surfaces X_w^n = \Gamma_w^n \backslash \mathbb{H}^2. We show that the classical Selberg zeta function Z_{\Gamma_w}(s) can be approximated by determinants of finite matrices whose entries are explicitly given in terms of the Riemann zeta function. Moreover, we prove an asymptotic expansion for the Hausdorff dimension \delta(w) as w\to \infty.
