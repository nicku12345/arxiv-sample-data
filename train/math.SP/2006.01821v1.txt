The goal of this paper is twofold. We prove that the operator H=L+V , a perturbation of the Taibleson-Vladimirov multiplier L=\mathfrak{D}^{\alpha} by a potential V(x)=b\left\Vert x\right\Vert ^{-\alpha}, b\geq b_{\ast}, is essentially self-adjoint and non-negative definite (the critical value b_{\ast} depends on \alpha and will be specified later). While the operator H is non-negative definite the potential V(x) may well take negative values, e.g. b_{\ast}<0 for all 0<\alpha<1. The equation Hu=v admiits a Green function g_{H}(x,y), the integral kernel of the operator H^{-1}. We obtain sharp lower- and upper bounds on the ratio of the functions g_{H}(x,y) and g_{L}(x,y). Examples illustrate our exposition.
