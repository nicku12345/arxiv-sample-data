Let L^2(D) be the space of measurable square-summable functions on the unit disk. Let L^2_a(D) be the Bergman space, i.e., the (closed) subspace of analytic functions in L^2(D). P_+ stays for the orthogonal projection going from L^2(D) to L^2_a(D). For a function \varphi\in L^\infty(D), the Toeplitz operator T_\varphi: L^2_a(D)\to L^2_a(D) is defined as  T_\varphi f=P_+\varphi f, \quad f\in L^2_a(D).  The main result of this article are spectral asymptotics for singular (or eigen-) values of compact Toeplitz operators with logarithmically decaying symbols, that is  \varphi(z)=\varphi_1(e^{i\theta})\, (1+\log(1/(1-r)))^{-\gamma},\quad \gamma>0,  where z=re^{i\theta} and \varphi_1 is a continuous (or piece-wise continuous) function on the unit circle. The result is applied to the spectral analysis of banded (including Jacobi) matrices.
