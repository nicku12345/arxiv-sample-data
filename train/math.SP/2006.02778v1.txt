In this work we prove that the eigenvalues of the n-dimensional massive Dirac operator \mathscr{D}_0 + V, n\ge2, perturbed by a possibly non-Hermitian potential V, are localized in the union of two disjoint disks of the complex plane, provided that V is sufficiently small with respect to the mixed norms L^1_{x_j} L^\infty_{\widehat{x}_j}, for j\in\{1,\dots,n\}. In the massless case, we prove instead that the discrete spectrum is empty under the same smallness assumption on V, and in particular the spectrum is the same of the unperturbed operator, namely \sigma(\mathscr{D}_0+V)=\sigma(\mathscr{D}_0)=\mathbb{R}. The main tools we employ are an abstract version of the Birman-Schwinger principle, which include also the study of embedded eigenvalues, and suitable resolvent estimates for the Schr\"odinger operator.
