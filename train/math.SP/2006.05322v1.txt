In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a bounded linear operator T to be generalized Drazin-Riesz invertible or generalized Drazin-meromorphic invertible. Also, we study generalized Browder's theorem and generalized a-Browder's theorem by means of set of interior points of various parts of spectrum of T.
