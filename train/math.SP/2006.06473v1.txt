We estimate the bottom of the L^2 spectrum of the Laplacian on locally symmetric spaces in terms of the critical exponents of appropriate Poincar\'e series. Our main result is the higher rank analog of a characterization due to Elstrodt, Patterson, Sullivan and Corlette in rank one. It improves upon previous results obtained by Leuzinger and Weber in higher rank.
