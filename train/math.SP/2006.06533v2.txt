The matrix Sturm-Liouville operator on a finite interval with the boundary conditions in the general self-adjoint form and with the singular potential from the class W_2^{-1} is studied. This operator generalizes Sturm-Liouville operators on geometrical graphs. We investigate structural and asymptotical properties of the spectral data (eigenvalues and weight matrices) of this operator. Furthermore, we prove the uniqueness of recovering the operator from its spectral data, by using the method of spectral mappings.
