In this paper, half inverse spectral problem for diffusion operator with jump conditions dependent on the spectral parameter and discontinuoty coeffcient is considered. The half inverse problems is studied of determining the coeffcient and two potential functions of the boundary value problem its spectrum by Hocstadt- Lieberman and Yang-Zettl methods. We show that two potential functions on the whole interval and the parameters in the boundary and jump conditions can be determined from spectrum.
