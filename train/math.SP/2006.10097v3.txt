Spectral inclusion and spectral pollution results are proved for sequences of linear operators of the form T_0 + i \gamma s_n on a Hilbert space, where s_n is strongly convergent to the identity operator and \gamma > 0. We work in both an abstract setting and a more concrete Sturm-Liouville framework. The results provide rigorous justification for a method of computing eigenvalues in spectral gaps.
