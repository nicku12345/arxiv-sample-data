We study the dynamics of resonances of analytic perturbations of 0th order pseudodifferential operators P(s). In particular, we prove a Fermi golden rule for resonances of P(s) at embedded eigenvalues of P=P(0). We also study the dynamics of eigenvalues of P(t)=P+it\Delta as the eigenvalues converge to simple eigenvalues of P. The 0th order pseudodifferential operators we consider satisfy natural dynamical assumptions and are used as microlocal models of internal waves.
