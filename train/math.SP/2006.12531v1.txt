The hyperbolic center of mass of a finite measure on the unit ball with respect to a radially increasing weight is shown to exist, be unique, and depend continuously on the measure. Prior results of this type are extended by characterizing the center of mass as the minimum point of an energy functional that is strictly convex along hyperbolic geodesics. A special case is Hersch's center of mass lemma on the sphere, which follows from convexity of a logarithmic kernel introduced by Douady and Earle.
