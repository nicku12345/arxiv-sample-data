We extend to the infinite dimensional context the link between two completely different topics recently highlighted by the authors: the classical eigenvalue problem for real square matrices and the Brouwer degree for maps between oriented finite dimensional real manifolds. Thanks to this extension, we solve a conjecture regarding global continuation in nonlinear spectral theory that we have formulated in a recent article. Our result (the ex conjecture) is applied to prove a Rabinowitz type global continuation property of the solutions to a perturbed motion equation containing an air resistance frictional force.
