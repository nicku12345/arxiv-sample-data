Let {\bf A} \in R^{n \times n} be a nonnegative irreducible square matrix and let r({\bf A}) be its spectral radius and Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue. Levinger asserted and several have proven that r(t):=r((1{-}t) {\bf A} + t {\bf A}^\top) increases over t \in [0,1/2] and decreases over t \in [1/2,1]. It has further been stated that r(t) is concave over t \in (0,1). Here we show that the latter claim is false in general through a number of counterexamples, but prove it is true for {\bf A} \in R^{2\times 2}, weighted shift matrices (but not cyclic weighted shift matrices), tridiagonal Toeplitz matrices, and the 3-parameter Toeplitz matrices from Fiedler, but not Toeplitz matrices in general. A general characterization of the range of t, or the class of matrices, for which the spectral radius is concave in Levinger's homotopy remains an open problem.
