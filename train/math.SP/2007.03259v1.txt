We study the asymptotic behaviour of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a boundary value problem for the Sturm-Liouville operator with general boundary conditions and the weight function perturbed by the so-called \delta'-like sequence \varepsilon^{-2}h(x/\varepsilon). The eigenvalue problem is realized as a family of non-self-adjoint matrix operators acting on the same Hilbert space and the norm resolvent convergence of this family is established. We also prove the Hausdorff convergence of the perturbed spectra.
