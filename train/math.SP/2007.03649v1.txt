Let A(t) be a holomorphic family of self-adjoint operators of type (B) on a complex Hilbert space \mathcal{H}. Kato-Rellich perturbation theory says that isolated eigenvalues of A(t) will be analytic functions of t as long as they remain below the minimum of the essential spectrum of A(t). At a threshold value t_0 where one of these eigenvalue functions hits the essential spectrum, the corresponding point in the essential spectrum might or might not be an eigenvalue of A(t_0). Our results generalize a theorem of Simon to give a sufficient condition for the minimum of the essential spectrum to be an eigenvalue of A(t_0) based on the rate at which eigenvalues approach the essential spectrum. We also show that the rates at which the eigenvalues of A(t) can approach the essential spectrum from below correspond to eigenvalues of a bounded self-adjoint operator. The key insight behind these results is the essential numerical range which was recently extended to unbounded operators by B\"{o}gli, Marletta, and Tretter.
