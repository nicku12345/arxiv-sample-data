With a proper function theoretic definition of the {\it cloud} of a positive measure with compact support in the real plane, a computational scheme of transforming the moments of the original measure into the moments of the uniformly distributed mass on the cloud is described. The main limiting operation involves exclusively truncated Christoffel-Darboux kernels, while error bounds depend on the spectral asymptotics of a Hankel kernel belonging to the Hilbert-Schmidt class.
