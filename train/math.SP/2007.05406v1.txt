We say that a bounded domain \Omega is optimal for the first positive curl eigenvalue \mu_1(\Omega) if \mu_1(\Omega)\leq \mu_1(\Omega') for any domain \Omega' with the same volume. In spite of the fact that \mu_1(\Omega) is uniformly lower bounded in terms of the volume, in this paper we prove that there are no axisymmetric optimal (and even locally minimizing) domains with C^{2,\alpha} boundary that satisfies a mild technical assumption. As a particular case, this rules out the existence of C^{2,\alpha} optimal axisymmetric domains with a convex section. An analogous result holds in the case of the first negative curl eigenvalue.
