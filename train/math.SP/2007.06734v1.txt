We show that for compact Riemannian manifolds of dimension at least 3 with nonempty boundary, we can modify the manifold by performing surgeries of codimension 2 or higher, while keeping the Steklov spectrum nearly unchanged. This shows that certain changes in the topology of a domain do not have an effect when considering shape optimization questions for Steklov eigenvalues in dimensions 3 and higher. Our result generalizes the 1-dimensional surgery in [FS2] to higher dimensional surgeries and to higher eigenvalues. It is proved in [FS2] that the unit ball does not maximize the first nonzero normalized Steklov eigenvalue among contractible domains in \mathbb{R}^n, for n \geq 3. We show that this is also true for higher Steklov eigenvalues. Using similar ideas we show that in \mathbb{R}^n, for n\geq 3, the j-th normalized Steklov eigenvalue is not maximized in the limit by a sequence of contractible domains degenerating to the disjoint union of j unit balls, in contrast to the case in dimension 2 [GP1].
