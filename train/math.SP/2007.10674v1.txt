Recently, Li et al. [Appl. Math. Comput. 382 (2020) 125335] proposed the problem of determining the Kirchhoff index and multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff index of graphs derived from S_n \times K_2, the Catersian product of the star S_n and the complete graph K_2. In the present paper, we completely solve this problem. That is, the explicit closed-form formulae of Kirchhoff index, multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff index, and number of spanning trees are obtained for some graphs derived from S_n \times K_2.
