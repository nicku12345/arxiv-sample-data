We discuss a Steklov-type problem for Maxwell's equations which is related to an interior Calder\'{o}n operator and an appropriate Dirichlet-to-Neumann type map. The corresponding Neumann-to-Dirichlet map turns out to be compact and this provides a Fourier basis of Steklov eigenfunctions for the associated energy spaces. With an approach similar to that developed by Auchmuty for the Laplace operator, we provide natural spectral representations for the appropriate trace spaces, for the Calder\'{o}n operator itself and for the solutions of the corresponding boundary value problems subject to electric or magnetic boundary conditions on a cavity.
