A canonical factorization is given for a quadratic pencil of accretive operators in a Hilbert space. Also, we establish some relationships between an m-accretive operator and its Moore-Penorse inverse. As an application, we study a result of existence, uniqueness, and maximal regularity of the strict solution for complete abstract second order differential equation in the non-homogeneous case. The paper is concluded with some questions left open from the preceding discussions.
