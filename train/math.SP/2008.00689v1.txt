Let G=(V,E) be a connected graph, where V=\{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n\}. Let d_i denote the degree of vertex v_i. The ABC matrix of G is defined as M(G)=(m_{ij})_{n \times n}, where m_{ij}=\sqrt{(d_i + d_j -2)/(d_i d_j)} if v_i v_j \in E, and 0 otherwise. The ABC spectral radius of G is the largest eigenvalue of M(G). In the present paper, we establish two graph perturbations with respect to ABC spectral radius. By applying these perturbations, the trees with the third, fourth, and fifth largest ABC spectral radii are determined.
