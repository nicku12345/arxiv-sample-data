We study two inverse problems of recovering the complex-valued square-integrable potential q(x) in the operator -y''(x)+q(x)y(a), y^{(\nu)}(0)=\gamma y^{(\nu)}(1) for \nu=0,1, where \gamma\in{\mathbb C}\setminus\{0\}. The first problem involves only single spectrum as the input data. We obtain complete characterization of the spectrum and prove that its specification determines q(x) uniquely if and only if \gamma\ne\pm1. For the rest cases: periodic and antiperiodic ones, we describe classes of iso-spectral potentials and provide restrictions under which the uniqueness holds. The second inverse problem deals with recovering q(x) from the two spectra related to \gamma=\pm1. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for its solvability and establish that uniqueness holds if and only if a=0,1. For a\in(0,1), we describe classes of iso-bispectral potentials and provide restrictions under which the uniqueness resumes. Algorithms for solving both inverse problems are provided.
