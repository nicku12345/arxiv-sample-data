The main purpose of this work is the construction of an analytic functional calculus for Clifford operators, which are operators acting on certain modules over Clifford algebras. Unlike in some preceding works by other authors, we use a spectrum defined in the complex plane, and certain stem functions, analytic in neighborhoods of such a spectrum. The replacement of the slice regular functions, having values in a Clifford algebra, by analytic stem functions becomes possible because of an isomorphism induced by a Cauchy type transform, whose existence is proved in the first part of this work.
