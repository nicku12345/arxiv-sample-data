Let (S^2,g) be a convex surface of revolution and H \subset S^2 the unique rotationally invariant geodesic. Let \varphi^\ell_m be the orthonormal basis of joint eigenfunctions of \Delta_g and \partial_\theta, the generator of the rotation action. The main result is an explicit formula for the weak-* limit of the normalized empirical measures, \Sigma_{m = -\ell}^\ell ||\varphi^\ell_m||^2_{L^2(H)} \delta_{\frac{m}{\ell}}(c) on [-1,1]. The explicit formula shows that, asymptotically, the L^2 norms of restricted eigenfunctions are minimal for the zonal eigenfunction m = 0, maximal for Gaussian beams m = \pm 1, and exhibit a (1 - c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}} type singularity at the endpoints. For a pseudo-differential operator B we also compute the limits of the normalized measures \sum_{m = -\ell}^\ell \langle B \varphi^\ell_m , \varphi^\ell_m \rangle \delta_{\frac{m}{\ell}}(c).
