We consider the inverse spectral theory of vibrating string equations. In this regard, first eigenvalue Ambarzumyan-type uniqueness theorems are stated and proved subject to separated, self-adjoint boundary conditions. More precisely, it is shown that there is a curve in the boundary parameters' domain on which no analog of it is possible. Necessary conditions of the n-th eigenvalue are identified, which allows to state the theorems. In addition, several properties of the first eigenvalue are examined. Lower and upper bounds are identified, and the areas are described in the boundary parameters' domain on which the sign of the first eigenvalue remains unchanged. This paper contributes to inverse spectral theory as well as to direct spectral theory.
