In this paper we study the eigenvalues of Hermitian Toeplitz matrices with the entries 2,-1,0,\ldots,0,-\alpha in the first column. Notice that the generating symbol depends on the order n of the matrix. If |\alpha|\le 1, then the eigenvalues belong to [0,4] and are asymptotically distributed as the function g(x)=4\sin^2(x/2) on [0,\pi]. The situation changes drastically when |\alpha|>1 and n tends to infinity. Then the two extreme eigenvalues (the minimal and the maximal one) lay out of [0,4] and converge rapidly to certain limits determined by the value of \alpha, whilst all others belong to [0,4] and are asymptotically distributed as g. In all cases, we transform the characteristic equation to a form convenient to solve by numerical methods, and derive asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues.
