In recent years, there appeared a considerable interest in the inverse spectral theory for functional-differential operators with constant delay. In particular, it is well known that specification of the spectra of two operators \ell_j, j=0,1, generated by one and the same functional-differential expression -y''(x)+q(x)y(x-a) under the boundary conditions y(0)=y^{(j)}(\pi)=0 uniquely determines the complex-valued square-integrable potential q(x) vanishing on (0,a) as soon as a\in[\pi/2,\pi). For many years, it has been a challenging {\it open question} whether this uniqueness result would remain true also when a\in(0,\pi/2). Recently, a positive answer was obtained for the case a\in[2\pi/5,\pi/2). In this paper, we give, however, a {\it negative} answer to this question for a\in[\pi/3,2\pi/5) by constructing an infinite family of iso-bispectral potentials. Some discussion on a possibility of constructing a similar counterexample for other types of boundary conditions is provided, and new open questions are outlined.
