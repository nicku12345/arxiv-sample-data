We consider the spectral problem for the Grushin Laplacian subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on a bounded open subset of \mathbb{R}^N. We prove that the symmetric functions of the eigenvalues depend real analytically upon domain perturbations and we prove an Hadamard-type formula for their shape differential. In the case of perturbations depending on a single scalar parameter, we prove a Rellich-Nagy-type theorem which describes the bifurcation phenomenon of multiple eigenvalues. As corollaries, we characterize the critical shapes under isovolumetric and isoperimetric perturbations in terms of overdetermined problems and we deduce a new proof of the Rellich-Pohozaev identity for the Grushin eigenvalues.
