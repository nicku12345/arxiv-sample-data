For the Schr\"odinger equation -d^2 u/dx^2 + q(x)u = \lambda u on a finite x-interval, there is defined an "asymmetry function" a(\lambda;q), which is entire of order 1/2 and type 1 in \lambda. Our main result identifies the classes of square-integrable potentials q(x) that possess a common asymmetry function. For any given a(\lambda), there is one potential for each Dirichlet spectral sequence.
