Spectral theory has widely used in complex networks and solved some practical problems. In this paper, we investigated the Laplacian and normalized Laplacian spectra of Mobius polyomino networks by using spectral theory. Let Mn denote Mobius polyomino networks (n>=3). As applications of the obtained results, the Kirchhoff index, multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff index, Kemeny's constant and spanning trees of Mn are obtained. Moreover, it is surprising to find that the multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff index of Mn is nine times as much as the Kirchhoff index.
