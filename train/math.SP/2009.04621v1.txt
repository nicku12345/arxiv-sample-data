Let H_n be the linear heptagonal networks with 2n heptagons. We study the structure properties and the eigenvalues of the linear heptagonal networks. According to the Laplacian polynomial of H_n, we utilize the decomposition theorem. Thus, the Laplacian spectrum of H_n is created by eigenvalues of a pair of matrices: L_A and L_S of order number 5n+1 and 4n+1, respectively. On the basis of the roots and coefficients of their characteristic polynomials of L_A and L_S, we not only get the explicit forms of Kirchhoff index, but also corresponding total complexity of H_n.
