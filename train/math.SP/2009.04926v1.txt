We study Sturm--Liouville differential operators on the time scales consisting of a finite number of isolated points and segments. In a previous paper it was established that such operators are uniquely determined by their spectral characteristics. In the present paper, an algorithm for their recovery based on the method of spectral mappings is obtained. We also prove that the eigenvalues of two Sturm--Liouville boundary value problems with one common boundary condition alternate.
