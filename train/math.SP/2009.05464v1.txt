The main result of this paper is to prove the strong real Jacobian conjecture under the symmetric assumption and reveals the link between it and the Jacobian conjecture. Precisely, we assume that F: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n is of C^1 map, n\geqslant 2, if for some \varepsilon >0,  0\notin Spec(F)~~\mbox{and}~ Spec(F+F^T) \subseteq (-\infty,-\varepsilon)~\mbox{or} ~(\varepsilon,+\infty), where Spec (F) denotes all eigenvalues of JF and Spec (F+F^T) denotes all eigenvalues of JF+JF^T, then we show that F is injective. It is proved by using a minimax argument.
