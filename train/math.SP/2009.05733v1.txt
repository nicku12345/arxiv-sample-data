In this paper, we study the number of traveling wave families near a shear flow (u,0) under the influence of Coriolis force, where the traveling speeds lie outside the range of u. Let \beta be the Rossby number. If the flow u has at least one critical point at which u attains its minimal (resp. maximal) value, then a unique transitional \beta value exists in the positive (resp. negative) half-line such that the number of traveling wave families near (u,0) changes suddenly from finite one to infinity when \beta passes through it. If u has no such critical points, then the number is always finite for positive (resp. negative) \beta values. This is true for general shear flows under a technical assumption, and for flows in class \mathcal{K}^+ unconditionally. The sudden change of the number of traveling wave families indicates that nonlinear dynamics around the shear flow is much richer than the non-rotating case, where no such traveling waves exist.
