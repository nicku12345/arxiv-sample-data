We consider a partially hinged composite plate problem and we investigate qualitative properties, e.g. symmetry and monotonicity, of the eigenfunction corresponding to the density minimizing the first eigenvalue. The analysis is performed by showing related properties of the Green function of the operator and by applying polarization with respect to a fixed plane. As a by-product of the study, we obtain a Hopf type boundary lemma for the operator having its own theoretical interest. The statements are complemented by numerical results.
