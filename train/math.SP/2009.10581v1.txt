We consider linear combinations of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a compact Riemannian manifold (M,g) and investigate a density property of their zero sets. More precisely, let f=\sum_{k=1}^m a_k \phi_{\lambda_{j_k}}, where -\Delta_g\phi_{\lambda}=\lambda\phi_{\lambda}. Denoting by Z_f the zero-set of f, we show that for any x\in M, dist(x,Z_f)\leq C(m)\lambda_{j_1}^{-1/2}. The proof is based on a new integral Harnack-type estimate for positive solutions of higher order elliptic PDEs.
