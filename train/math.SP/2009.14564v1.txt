A Laplacian eigenfunction on a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold provides a natural partition into Neumann domains (a.k.a. Morse-Smale complexes). This partition is generated by gradient flow lines of the eigenfunction -- these bound the so-called Neumann domains. We prove that the Neumann Laplacian \Delta defined on a single Neumann domain is self-adjoint and possesses a purely discrete spectrum. In addition, we prove that the restriction of the eigenfunction to any one of its Neumann domains is an eigenfunction of \Delta. As a comparison, similar statements for a nodal domain of an eigenfunction (with the Dirichlet Laplacian) are basic and well-known. The difficulty here is that the boundary of a Neumann domain may have cusps and cracks, and hence is not necessarily continuous, so standard results about Sobolev spaces are not available.
