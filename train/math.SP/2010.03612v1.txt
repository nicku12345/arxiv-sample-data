The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how different types of boundary conditions do not impact the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of thermoelastic wave model. For an initial-boundary value problem associated with this system, we prove a global well-posedness result in a certain topology under appropriate regularity conditions on the data. Further, we show that under particular classes of boundary conditions, the energy associated to the system decays polynomially to zero and not exponentially.
