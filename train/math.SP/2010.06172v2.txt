In this note we present upper bounds for the variational eigenvalues of the p-Laplacian on smooth domains of complete n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and Neumann boundary conditions, and on compact (boundaryless) Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we provide upper bounds in the conformal class of a given manifold (M,g) for 1<p\leq n, and upper bounds for all p>1 when we fix a metric g. To do so, we use a metric approach for the construction of suitable test functions for the variational characterization of the eigenvalues. The upper bounds agree with the well-known asymptotic estimate of the eigenvalues due to Friedlander. We also present upper bounds for the variational eigenvalues on hypersurfaces bounding smooth domains in a Riemannian manifold in terms of the isoperimetric ratio.
