We obtain upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues \sigma_k(M) of a smooth, compact, connected, n-dimensional submanifold M of Euclidean space with boundary \Sigma that involve the intersection indices of M and of \Sigma. One of our main results is an explicit upper bound in terms of the intersection index of \Sigma, the volume of \Sigma and the volume of M as well as dimensional constants. By also taking the injectivity radius of \Sigma into account, we obtain an upper bound that has the optimal exponent of k with respect to the asymptotics of the Steklov eigenvalues as k \to \infty.
