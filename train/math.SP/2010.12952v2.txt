We study the generalized eigenvalue problem on the whole space for a class of integro-differential elliptic operators. The nonlocal operator is over a finite measure, but this has no particular structure and it can even be singular. The first part of the paper presents results concerning the existence of a principal eigenfunction. Then we present various necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the maximum principle to hold, and use these to characterize the simplicity of the principal eigenvalue.
