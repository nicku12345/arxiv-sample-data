Let A be a square matrix and let \Omega be an open set in the plane containing the spectrum of A. We consider the problem of maximizing the operator norm \|f(A)\| amongst all holomorphic functions f from \Omega into the closed unit disk. If f_0 is extremal for this problem and if \|f_0(A)\|>1, then it turns out that the matrix f_0(A) has special properties, among them the fact that its principal left and right singular vectors are mutually orthogonal. We study this class of exceptional matrices f_0(A). In particular, we are interested in the extent to which they are characterized by the aforementioned orthogonality property.
