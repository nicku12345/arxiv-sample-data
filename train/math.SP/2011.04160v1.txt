This is a continuous of our previous work on comparison of Steklov eigenvalues and Laplacian eigenvalues for graphs. In this paper, we obtain some comparisons of the Dirichlet Laplacian eigenvalues, Neumann Laplacian eigenvalues and Laplacian eigenvalues on graphs. We also discuss the rigidity and some of their applications including some Lichnerowicz-type estimates for Dirichlet Laplacian eigenvalues and Neumann Laplacian eigenvalues.
