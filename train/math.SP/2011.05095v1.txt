The compression of the resolvent of a non-self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operator -\Delta+V onto a subdomain \Omega\subset\mathbb R^n is expressed in a Krein-Naimark type formula, where the Dirichlet realization on \Omega, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps, and certain solution operators of closely related boundary value problems on \Omega and \mathbb R^n\setminus\overline\Omega are being used. In a more abstract operator theory framework this topic is closely connected and very much inspired by the so-called coupling method that has been developed for the self-adjoint case by Henk de Snoo and his coauthors.
