The kinetic Brownian motion on the sphere bundle of a Riemannian manifold M is a stochastic process that models a random perturbation of the geodesic flow. If M is a orientable compact constantly curved surface, we show that in the limit of infinitely large perturbation the L^2-spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of a time rescaled version of the process converges to the Laplace spectrum of the base manifold.
