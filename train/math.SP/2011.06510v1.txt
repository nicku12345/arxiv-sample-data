We consider the Dirac system on the interval [0,1] with a spectral parameter \mu\in\mathbb{C} and a complex-valued potential with entries from L_p[0,1], where 1\leq p <2. We study the asymptotic behavior of its solutions in a stripe |{\rm Im}\,\mu|\le d for \mu\to \infty. These results allows us to obtain sharp asymptotic formulas for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of Sturm--Liouville operators associated with the aforementioned Dirac system.
