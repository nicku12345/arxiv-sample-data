The graph Cheeger constant and Cheeger inequalities are generalized to the case of hypergraphs whose edges have the same cardinality. In particular, it is shown that the second largest eigenvalue of the generalized normalized Laplacian is bounded both above and below by the generalized Cheeger constant, and the corresponding eigenfunctions can be used to approximate the Cheeger cut.
