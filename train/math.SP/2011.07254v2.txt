It is well known that uniform resolvent estimates imply spectral cluster estimates. We show that the converse is also true in some cases. In particular, the universal spectral cluster estimates of Sogge \cite{MR930395} for the Laplace--Beltrami operator on compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary directly imply the uniform Sobolev inequality of Dos Santos Ferreira, Kenig and Salo \cite{MR3200351}, without any reference to parametrices. This observation also yields new resolvent estimates for manifolds with boundary or with nonsmooth metrics, based on spectral cluster bounds of Smith--Sogge \cite{MR2316270} and Smith, Koch and Tataru~\cite{MR2443996}, respectively. We also convert the recent spectral cluster bounds of Canzani and Galkowski \cite{Canzani--Galkowski} to improved resolvent bounds. Moreover, we show that the resolvent estimates are stable under perturbations and use this to establish uniform Sobolev and spectral cluster inequalities for Schr\"odinger operators with singular potentials.
