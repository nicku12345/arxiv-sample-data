The second nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian on S^{2} becomes maximal as the surface degenerates to two disjoint spheres, by a result of Nadirashvili. On spheres in all dimensions, an upper bound on the eigenvalue was derived by Petrides (the odd-dimensional case was proved earlier by Girouard, Nadirashvili, and Polterovich). Druet showed that the inequality is not sharp on higher dimensional sphere. In this paper, we will provide a simpler proof of these inequalities in all dimensions by adapting the trial function construction of Freitas and Laugesen from hyperbolic space.
