Let \{e_j\} be an orthonormal basis of Laplace eigenfunctions of a compact Riemannian manifold (M,g). Let H \subset M be a submanifold and let \{\psi_k\} be an orthonormal basis of Laplace eigenfunctions of H with the induced metric. We obtain joint asymptotics for the Fourier coefficients \[   \langle \gamma_H e_j, \psi_k \rangle_{L^2(H)} = \int_H e_j \overline \psi_k \, dV_H, \] of restrictions \gamma_H e_j of e_j to H. In particular, we obtain asymptotics for the sums of the norm-squares of the Fourier coefficients over the joint spectrum \{(\mu_k, \lambda_j)\}_{j,k - 0}^{\infty} of the (square roots of the) Laplacian \Delta_M on M and the Laplacian \Delta_H on H in a family of suitably `thick' regions in \mathbb R^2. Thick regions include (1) the truncated cone \mu_k/\lambda_j \in [a,b] \subset (0,1) and \lambda_j \leq \lambda, and (2) the slowly thickening strip |\mu_k - c\lambda_j| \leq w(\lambda) and \lambda_j \leq \lambda, where w(\lambda) is monotonic and 1 \ll w(\lambda) \lesssim \lambda^{1 - 1/n}. Key tools for obtaining these asymptotics include the composition calculus of Fourier integral operators and a new multidimensional Tauberian theorem.
