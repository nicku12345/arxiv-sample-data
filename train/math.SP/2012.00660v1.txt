Barry Simon conjectured in 2005 that the Szeg\H{o} matrices, associated with Verblunsky coefficients \{\alpha_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}_+} obeying \sum_{n = 0}^\infty n^\gamma |\alpha_n|^2 < \infty for some \gamma \in (0,1), are bounded for values z \in \partial \mathbb{D} outside a set of Hausdorff dimension no more than 1 - \gamma. Three of the authors recently proved this conjecture by employing a Pr\"ufer variable approach that is analogous to work Christian Remling did on Schr\"odinger operators. This paper is a companion piece that presents a simple proof of a weak version of Simon's conjecture that is in the spirit of a proof of a different conjecture of Simon.
