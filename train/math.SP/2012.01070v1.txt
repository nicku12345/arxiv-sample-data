Sufficient and necessary conditions on the spectral measure of a self-adjoint operator A, acting in a Hilbert space, are obtained, under which for any continuous scalar function the operator function \phi(A+\gamma B) is holomorphic with rspect to the coupling constant \gamma in a neighborhood of \gamma=0, where B is a self-adjoint operator. The sharpest results are obtained in the case where B is a rank-one operator.
