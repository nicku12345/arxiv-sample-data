Let \mathcal{G} be a metric noncompact connected graph with finitely many edges. The main object of the paper is the Hamiltonian {\bf H}_{\alpha} associated in L^2(\mathcal{G};\mathbb{C}^m) with a matrix Sturm-Liouville expression and boundary delta-type conditions at each vertex. Assuming that the potential matrix is summable and applying the technique of boundary triplets and the corresponding Weyl functions, we show that the singular continuous spectrum of the Hamiltonian {\bf H}_{\alpha} as well as any other self-adjoint realization of the Sturm-Liouville expression is empty. We also indicate conditions on the graph ensuring pure absolute continuity of the positive part of {\bf H}_{\alpha}. Under an additional condition on the potential matrix, a Bargmann-type estimate for the number of negative eigenvalues of {\bf H}_{\alpha} is obtained. Additionally, for a star graph \mathcal{G} a formula is found for the scattering matrix of the pair \{{\bf H}_{\alpha}, {\bf H}_D\}, where {\bf H}_D is the Dirichlet operator on \mathcal{G}.
