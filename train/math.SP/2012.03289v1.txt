If T is a (densely defined) self-adjoint operator acting on a complex Hilbert space \mathcal{H} and I stands for the identity operator, we introduce the delta function operator \lambda \mapsto \delta \left(\lambda I-T\right)  at T. When T is a bounded operator, then \delta \left(\lambda I-T\right)  is an operator-valued distribution. If T is unbounded, \delta \left(\lambda I-T\right)  is a more general object that still retains some properties of distributions. We derive various operative formulas involving \delta \left(\lambda I-T\right)  and give several applications of its usage.
