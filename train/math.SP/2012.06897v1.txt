Our studies concern some aspects of scattering theory of the singular differential systems  y'-x^{-1}Ay-q(x)y=\rho By, \ x>0  with n\times n matrices A,B, q(x), x\in(0,\infty), where A,B are constant and \rho is a spectral parameter. We concentrate on the important special case when q(\cdot) is smooth and q(0)=0 and derive a formula that express such q(\cdot) in the form of some special contour integral, where the kernel can be written in terms of the Weyl - type solutions of the considered differential system. Formulas of such a type play an important role in constructive solution of inverse scattering problems: use of such formulas, where the terms in their right-hand sides are previously found from the so-called main equation, provides a final step of the solution procedure. In order to obtain the above-mentioned reconstruction formula we establish first the asymptotical expansions for the Weyl - type solutions as \rho\to\infty with o\left(\rho^{-1}\right) rate remainder estimate.
