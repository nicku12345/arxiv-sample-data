Muraleetharan and Thirulogasanthan in (J. Math. phys. 59, No. 10, 103506, 27p. (2018)) introduced the concept of Calkin Sspectrum of a bounded quaternionic linear operators. The study of this spectrum is establisched using the Fredholm operators theory. Motivated by this, we study the general framework of the Fredholm element with respect to a quaternionic Banach algebra homomorphism. First, we investigate the Fredholm S-spectrum of the sum of two elements in quaternionic Banach algebra by means of the Fredholm S-spectrum of the two elements. Next, we prove a perturbation result on this spectrum. We also study the boundary S-spectrum. As application, we investigate the Fredholm and Weyl S-spectra of bounded right quaternionic linear operators.
