The spectrum of the normalized complex Laplacian for electrical networks is analyzed. We show that eigenvalues lie in a larger region compared to the case of the real Laplacian. We show the existence of eigenvalues with negative real part and absolute value greater than 2. An estimate from below for the first non-vanishing eigenvalue in modulus is provided. We supplement the estimates with examples, showing sharpness.
