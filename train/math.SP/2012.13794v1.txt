We study the Schr\"odinger operator in the plane with a step magnetic field function. The bottom of its spectrum is described by the infimum of the lowest eigenvalue band function, for which we establish the existence and uniqueness of the non-degenerate minimum. We discuss the curvature effects on the localization properties of magnetic ground states, among other applications.
