Let (\Omega,g) be a piecewise-smooth, bounded convex domain in \R^2 and consider L^2-normalized Neumann eigenfunctions \phi_{\lambda} with eigenvalue \lambda^2 and u_{\lambda}:= \phi_{\lambda} |_{\partial \Omega} the associated Dirichlet data (ie. boundary restriction of \phi_{\lambda}). Our first main result (Theorem \ref{T:non-con}) is a small-scale {\em non-concentration} estimate: We prove that for {\em any} x_0 \in \overline{\Omega}, (including boundary corner points) and any \delta \in [0,1),  \| \phi_h \|_{B(x_0,\lambda^{-\delta})\cap \Omega} = O(\lambda^{-\delta/2}). Our subsequent results involve applications of the nonconcentration estimate to upper bounds for L^2 restrictions of boundary eigenfunctions that are valid up to boundary corners. In particular, in Theorem \ref{dirichlet} we prove that for any {\em flat} boundary edge \Gamma (possibly including corner points), the boundary restrictions u_h:= \phi_h |_{\partial \Omega} satisfy the bounds  \|u_{\lambda} \|_{L^2(\Gamma)} = O_{\epsilon}(\lambda^{1/4 + \epsilon}), for any \epsilon >0. The exponent 1/4 is sharp and the result improves on the O(\lambda^{1/3}) universal L^2-restriction bound for Neumann eigenfunctions due to Tataru \cite{Ta}. The O(\lambda^{1/4}) -bound is also an extension to the boundary (including corner points) of well-known interior L^2 restriction bounds of Burq-Gerard-Tzvetkov \cite{BGT} along totally-geodesic hypersurfaces.
