Let B_+ and B_- be nonnegative symmetric operators with defect numbers (1,1) in Hilbert spaces \mathcal H_+ and \mathcal H_-. We consider the coupling A of operators A_+=B_+ and A_-=-B_- which is self-adjoint, nonnegative and has a nonempty resolvent set in the Kre\u{\i}n space \mathcal K with the fundamental decomposition \mathcal K=\mathcal H_+[+]\mathcal H_-. Such an operator is definitizable and has at most two critical points at \infty and 0. It is similar to a self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space if and only if its critical points are regular and there are no Jordan chains at 0. We find criteria for the regularity of critical points of A formulated in terms of the abstract Weyl functions m_+ and m_- of the operators B_+ and B_-.   A typical example of such coupling is the operator A generated in the Kre\u{\i}n space \mathcal K = L^2_w(I) by the differential expression \[ \mathfrak{a}f := - \frac{1}{w}\left( \frac{1}{r} f' \right)', \] where I=(b_-,b_+), -\infty \leq b_- <0 < b_+ \leq + \infty, r, w \in L^1_{\operatorname{loc}}(I), r(t) >0 and (\operatorname{sgn} t) w(t) > 0 a.e. on I. The operator A is self-adjoint in the Kre\u{\i}n space L^2_w(I) and can be considered as the coupling of the restrictions of A onto L^2_{w_-}(I_-) and L^2_{w_+}(I_+), where I_- = (b_-,0), I_+ = (0,b_+), w_{-} is the restriction of -w onto I_- and w_{+} is the restriction of w onto I_+. For this operator the general criteria for the regularity of a critical point are reformulated in terms of the coefficients w and r.
