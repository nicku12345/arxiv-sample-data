There is a vast theory of Chebyshev and residual polynomials and their asymptotic behavior. The former ones maximize the leading coefficient and the latter ones maximize the point evaluation with respect to an L^\infty norm. We study Chebyshev and residual extremal problems for rational functions with real poles with respect to subsets of \overline{\mathbb{R}}. We prove root asymptotics under fairly general assumptions on the sequence of poles. Moreover, we prove Szeg\H{o}--Widom asymptotics for sets which are regular for the Dirichlet problem and obey the Parreau--Widom and DCT conditions.
