Given a smooth manifold M (with or without boundary), in this paper we study the regularisation of traces for the global pseudo-differential calculus in the context of non-harmonic analysis. Indeed, using the global pseudo-differential calculus on manifolds (with or without boundary) developed in [30], the Calder\'on-Vaillancourt Theorem and the global functional calculus in [6], we determine the singularity orders in the regularisation of traces and the sharp regularity orders for the Dixmier traceability of the global H\"ormander classes. Our analysis (free of coordinate systems) allows us to obtain non-harmonic analogues of several classical results arising from the microlocal analysis of regularised traces for pseudo-differential operators with symbols defined by localisations.
