As is known, for each fixed \nu\in\{0,1\}, the spectra of two operators generated by -y''(x)+q(x)y(x-a) and the boundary conditions y^{(\nu)}(0)=y^{(j)}(\pi)=0, j=0,1, uniquely determine the complex-valued square-integrable potential q(x) vanishing on (0,a) as soon as a\in[2\pi/5,\pi). Meanwhile, it actually became the main question of the inverse spectral theory for Sturm-Liouville operators with constant delay whether the uniqueness holds also for smaller values of a. Recently, a negative answer was given by the authors [Appl. Math. Lett. 113 (2021) 106862] for a\in[\pi/3,2\pi/5) in the case \nu=0 by constructing an infinite family of iso-bispectral potentials. Moreover, an essential and dramatic reason was established why this strategy, generally speaking, fails in the remarkable case when \nu=1. Here we construct a counterexample giving a negative answer for \nu=1, which is an important subcase of the Robin boundary condition at zero. We also refine the former counterexample for \nu=0 to W_2^1-potentials.
