We reconsider generalizations of Hardy's inequality corresponding to the case of (point) dipole potentials V_{\gamma}(x) = \gamma (u, x) |x|^{-3}, x \in \mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\}, \gamma \in [0,\infty), u \in \mathbb{R}^n, |u|=1, n \in \mathbb{N}, n \geq 3. More precisely, for n \geq 3, we provide an alternative proof of the existence of a critical dipole coupling constant \gamma_{c,n} > 0, such that \begin{align*} &\text{for all \gamma \in [0,\gamma_{c,n}], and all u \in \mathbb{R}^n, |u|=1,} \\ &\quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} d^n x \, |(\nabla f)(x)|^2 \geq \pm \gamma \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} d^n x \, (u, x) |x|^{-3} |f(x)|^2, \quad f \in D^1(\mathbb{R}^n). \end{align*} with D^1(\mathbb{R}^n) denoting the completion of C_0^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n) with respect to the norm induced by the gradient. Here \gamma_{c,n} is sharp, that is, the largest possible such constant, and we discuss a numerical scheme for its computation. Moreover, we discuss upper and lower bounds for \gamma_{c,n} > 0.   We also consider the case of multicenter dipole interactions with dipoles centered on an infinite discrete set.
