The work is devoted to the study of the similarity of a correct restriction to some self-adjoint operator in the case when the minimal operator is symmetric. The resulting theorem was applied to the Sturm-Liouville operator and the Laplace operator. It is shown that the spectrum of a non self-adjoint singularly perturbed operator is real and the corresponding system of eigenvectors forms a Riesz basis.
