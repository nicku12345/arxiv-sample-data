We discuss the problem of unique determination of the finite free discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operator from its spectrum, also known as Ambarzumian problem, with various boundary conditions, namely any real constant boundary condition at zero and Floquet boundary conditions of any angle. Then we prove the following Ambarzumian-type mixed inverse spectral problem: Diagonal entries except the first and second ones and a set of two consecutive eigenvalues uniquely determine the finite free discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operator.
