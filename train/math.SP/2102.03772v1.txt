Let T denote a positive operator with spectral radius 1 on, say, an L^p-space. A classical result in infinite dimensional Perron--Frobenius theory says that, if T is irreducible and power bounded, then its peripheral point spectrum is either empty or a subgroup of the unit circle.   In this note we show that the analogous assertion for the entire peripheral spectrum fails. More precisely, for every finite union U of finite subgroups of the unit circle we construct an irreducible stochastic operator on \ell^1 whose peripheral spectrum equals U.   We also give a similar construction for the C_0-semigroup case.
