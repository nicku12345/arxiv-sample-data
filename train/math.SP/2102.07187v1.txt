Motivated by the study of high energy Steklov eigenfunctions, we examine the semi-classical Robin Laplacian. In the two dimensional situation, we determine an effective operator describing the asymptotic distribution of the negative eigenvalues, and we prove that the corresponding eigenfunctions decay away from the boundary, for all dimensions.
