In recent years, there appeared a considerable interest in the inverse spectral theory for functional-differential operators with constant delay. In particular, it is well known that, for each fixed \nu\in\{0,1\}, the spectra of two operators generated by one and the expression -y''(x)+q(x)y(x-a) and the boundary conditions y^{(\nu)}(0)=y^{(j)}(\pi)=0, j=0,1, uniquely determine the complex-valued square-integrable potential q(x) vanishing on (0,a) as soon as a\in[\pi/2,\pi). For a<\pi/2, the main equation of the corresponding inverse problem is nonlinear, and it actually became the basic question of the inverse spectral theory for Sturm-Liouville operators with constant delay whether the uniqueness holds also in this nonlinear case. A few years ago, a positive answer was obtained for a\in[2\pi/5,\pi/2). Recently, the authors gave, however, a negative answer for a\in[\pi/3,2\pi/5) by constructing infinite families of iso-bispectral potentials. Meanwhile, the question remained open for the most difficult nonlinear case a\in(0,\pi/3), allowing the parameter a to approach the classical situation a=0, in which the uniqueness is well known. In the present paper, we address this gap and give a negative answer in this remarkable case by constructing appropriate iso-bispectral potentials.
