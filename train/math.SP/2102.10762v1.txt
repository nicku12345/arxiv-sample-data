This paper considers the comparison between the eigenvalues of Laplace operators with the standard conditions and the anti-standard conditions on non-bipartite graphs which are equilateral or inequilateral. First of all, we show the calculation of the eigenvalues of Laplace operators on equilateral metric graphs with arbitrary edge length. Based on this method, we use the properties of the cosine function and the arccosine function to find the comparison between the eigenvalues of Laplace operators with the standard conditions and the anti-standard conditions on equilateral non-bipartite graphs. In addition, we give the inequalities between standard and anti-standard eigenvalues on a special inequilateral non-bipartite graph.
