In this paper, we establish Cwikel-type estimates for noncommutative tori for any dimension~n\geq 2. We use them to derive a Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum inequality for the number of negative eigenvalues of fractional Schr\"{o}dinger operators on noncommutative tori in any dimension~n\geq 2. In order to do so we establish a "borderline version" of the abstract Birman-Schwinger principle for the number of negative eigenvalues of relatively compact form perturbations of a non-negative semi-bounded operator with isolated 0-eigenvalue.
