For the radial and one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger operator H with growing potential q(x) we outline a method of obtaining the trace identities - an asymptotic expansion of the Fredholm determinant \mathrm{det}_{F}(H-\lambda I) as \lambda\to-\infty. As an illustrating example, we consider Schr\"{o}dinger operator with the potential q(x)=2\cosh 2x, associated with the modified Mathieu equation.
