For a singular measure \mu, Ahlfors regular of order \alpha>0, with compact support in \mathbb{R}^{\mathbf{N}} and a pseudodifferential operator \mathbf{A} of order -l=-\mathbf{N}/2 we consider the compact operator \mathbf{T}(P,\mathbf{A}) = \mathbf{A}^*P\mathbf{A}. Here P is the signed measure, P=V\mu with density V belonging to the Orlicz class L^{\Psi,\mu} with \Psi(t)=(t+1)\log(t+1)-t. Using eigenvalue estimates for such operators, obtained in \texttt{arXiv:2011.14877}, we establish eigenvalue asymptotics of \mathbf{T}(P,\mathbf{A}) for a class of measures, including the ones supported on uniformly rectifiable sets. These results lead to the measurability in the sense of A.Connes of operators \mathbf{T}(P,\mathbf{A}) and a formula for the singular trace of these operators, producing a noncommutative version of integral with respect to singular measure.
