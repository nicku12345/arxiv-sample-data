Consider an L^2-normalized Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunction e_\lambda on a compact, boundary-less Riemannian manifold with \Delta e_\lambda = -\lambda^2 e_\lambda. We study eigenfunction triple products \[   \langle e_\lambda e_\mu, e_\nu \rangle = \int e_\lambda e_\mu \overline{e_\nu} \, dV. \] We show the overall \ell^2-concentration of these triple products is determined by the measure of some set of configurations of triangles with side lengths equal to the frequencies \lambda,\mu, and \nu. A rapidly vanishing proportion of this mass lies in the `classically forbidden' regime where \lambda, \mu, and \nu fail to satisfy the triangle inequality. As a consequence, we improve a result by Lu, Sogge, and Steinerberger.
