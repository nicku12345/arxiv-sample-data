In this paper, we introduce the class of diagonally dominant (with respect to a given LMI region {\mathfrak D} \subset {\mathbb C}) matrices that possesses the analogues of well-known properties of (classical) diagonally dominant matrices, e.g their spectra are localized inside the region \mathfrak D. Moreover, we show that in some cases, diagonal \mathfrak D-dominance implies ({\mathfrak D}, {\mathcal D})-stability ( i.e. the preservation of matrix spectra localization under multiplication by a positive diagonal matrix). Basing on the properties of diagonal stability and diagonal dominance, we analyze the conditions for stability of second-order dynamical systems. We show that these conditions are preserved under system perturbations of a specific form (so-called D-stability). We apply the concept of diagonal \mathfrak D-dominance to the analysis of the minimal decay rate of second-order systems and its persistence under specific perturbations (so-called relative D-stability). Diagonal \mathfrak D-dominance with respect to some conic region \mathfrak D is also shown to be a sufficient condition for stability and D-stability of fractional-order systems.
