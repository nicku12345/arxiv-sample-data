We use Rokhlin's Theorem on the uniqueness of canonical systems to find a new way to establish connections between Function Theory in the unit disk and rank one perturbations of self-adjoint or unitary operators. In the n-dimensional case, we prove that for any cyclic self-adjoint operator A, operator A_\lambda= A + \Sigma_{k=1}^n \lambda_k(\cdot,\phi_k)\phi_k is pure point for a. e. \lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,...,\lambda_n) \in\Bbb R^n iff operator A_\eta=A+\eta(\cdot,\phi_k)\phi_k is pure point for a.e.\ \eta\in\Bbb R for k=1,2,...,n. We also show that if A_\lambda is pure point for a.e.\ \lambda\in \Bbb R^n then A_\lambda is pure point for a.e.\ \lambda\in \gamma for any analytic curve \gamma\in\Bbb R^n.
