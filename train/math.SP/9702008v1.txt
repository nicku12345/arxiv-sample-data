We introduce and study dual n_1-Appell-like systems which are the simple generalization of generalized dual Appell systems in Infinite-Dimensional Analysis (IDA). We study connected with these systems objects of IDA: the analogues of Kondratiev spaces, S-transform, characterization theorems etc. The results we obtained are useful to application in the theory of probability.
