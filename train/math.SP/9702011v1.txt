There is constructed and considered the extension of classical Diriclet operator corresponding to uniformly log-concave measure in the space of symmetric differential forms. Sufficient conditions for its essential self-adjointness in one-dimensional case as well as for the same of its "sypersymmetric" part in general situations are given.
