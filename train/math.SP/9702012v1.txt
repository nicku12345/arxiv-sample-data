Is considered the asymptotical behavior of spectral function \rho(\lambda, \epsilon),\epsilon > 0, of one family of self adjoint differential operators of second order, defined in space L_2[0,+\infty) with potentials, depending on \epsilon. Are given evaluations for the derivative of spectral function for negative \lambda and is proved the weak convergence of \rho'(\lambda, \epsilon) to \rho'(\lambda, 0) with \epsilon \to +0.
