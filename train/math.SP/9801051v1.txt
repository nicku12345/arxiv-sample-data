For any real limit-n 2nth-order selfadjoint linear differential expression on [0,\infty), Titchmarsh- Weyl matrices   M(\lambda) can be defined. Two matrices of particu lar interest are the matrices M_D(\lambda) and M_N(\lambda) assoc iated respectively with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions at x=0. These satisfy   M_D(\lambda) = -M_{N}(\lambda)^{-1}. It is known that when these matrices have poles (which can only lie on the real axis) the existence of valid HELP inequalities depends on their behaviour in the neighbourhood of these poles. We prove a conjecture of Bennewitz and use it, together with a new algorithm for computing the Laurent expansion of a Titchmarsh-Weyl matrix in the neighbourhood of a pole, to investigate the existence of HELP inequalities for a number of differential equations which have so far proved awkward to analyse
