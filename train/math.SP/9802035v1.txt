A virial theorem is established for the operator proposed by Brown and Ravenhall as a model for relativistic one-electron atoms. As a consequence, it is proved that the operator has no eigenvalues greater than \max(m c^2, 2 \alpha Z - \frac{1}{2}), where \alpha is the fine structure constant, for all values of the nuclear charge Z below the critical value Z_c: in particular there are no eigenvalues embedded in the essential spectrum when Z \leq 3/4 \alpha. Implications for the operators in the partial wave decomposition are also described.
