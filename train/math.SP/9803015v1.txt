The Hardy-Rellich inequality given here generalizes a Hardy inequality of Davies (1984), from the case of the Dirichlet Laplacian of a region \Omega\subseteq\real^N to that of the higher order polyharmonic operators with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The inequality yields some immediate spectral information for the polyharmonic operators and also bounds on the trace of the associated semigroups and resolvents.
