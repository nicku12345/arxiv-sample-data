We propose a method for obtaining rigorous and accurate upper and lower bounds on the eigenvalues of ordinary and partial differential operators in bounded regions of Euclidean space. It uses a boundary condition homotopy method starting from a decomposition of the region into several simpler regions for which the eigenvalues can already be computed accurately. Several numerical examples are presented.
