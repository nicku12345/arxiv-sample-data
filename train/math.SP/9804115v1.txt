We consider the heat kernel (and the zeta function) associated with Laplace type operators acting on a general irreducible rank 1 locally symmetric space X. The set of Minakshisundaram- Pleijel coefficients {A_k(X)}_{k=0}^{\infty} in the short-time asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel is calculated explicitly.
