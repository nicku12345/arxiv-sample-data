Let M be a connected, noncompact, complete Riemannian manifold, consider the operator L=\DD +\nn V for some V\in C^2(M) with \exp[V] integrable w.r.t. the Riemannian volume element. This paper studies the existence of the spectral gap of L. As a consequence of the main result, let \rr be the distance function from a point o, then the spectral gap exists provided \lim_{\rr\to\infty}\sup L\rr<0 while the spectral gap does not exist if o is a pole and \lim_{\rr\to\infty}\inf L\rr\ge 0. Moreover, the elliptic operators on \mathbb R^d are also studied.
