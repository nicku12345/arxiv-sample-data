We consider the spectral function \rho(\mu) (\mu \geq 0) for the Sturm-Liouville equation y^{''}+(\lambda-q)y =0 on [0,\infty) with the boundary condition y(0)=0 and where q has slow decay O(x^{-\alpha}) (a>0) as x\to \infty. We develop our previous methods of locating spectral concentration for q with rapid exponential decay (JCAM 81 (1997) 333-348) to deal with the new theoretical and computational complexities which arise for slow decay.
