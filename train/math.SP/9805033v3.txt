On the half line [0,\infty) we study first order differential operators of the form B 1/i d/(dx) + Q(x), where B:=\mat{B_1}{0}{0}{-B_2}, B_1,B_2\in M(n,\C) are self--adjoint positive definite matrices and Q:\R_+\to M(2n,\C), \R_+:=[0,\infty), is a continuous self-adjoint off-diagonal matrix function.   We determine the self-adjoint boundary conditions for these operators. We prove that for each such boundary value problem there exists a unique matrix spectral function \sigma and a generalized Fourier transform which diagonalizes the corresponding operator in L^2_{\sigma}(R, C).   We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a matrix function \sigma to be the spectral measure of a matrix potential Q. Moreover we present a procedure based on a Gelfand-Levitan type equation for the determination of Q from \sigma .   Our results generalize earlier results of M. Gasymov and B. Levitan.   We apply our results to show the existence of 2n\times 2n Dirac systems with purely absolute continuous, purely singular continuous and purely discrete spectrum of multiplicity p, where 1\le p \le n is arbitrary.
