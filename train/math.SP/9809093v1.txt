We consider the analytic continuation of the transfer function for a 2x2 matrix Hamiltonian into the unphysical sheets of the energy Riemann surface. We construct a family of non-selfadjoint operators which reproduce certain parts of the transfer-function spectrum including resonances situated on the unphysical sheets neighboring the physical sheet. On this basis, completeness and basis properties for the root vectors of the transfer function (including those for the resonances) are proved.
