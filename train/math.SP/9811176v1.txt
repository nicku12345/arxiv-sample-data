Consider the Schroeodinger equation: - Du(x) - l(x)u + s(x)u = 0, where D is the Laplacian, l(x) > 0 and s(x) is dominated by l(x). We shall extend the celebrated Kato's result on the asymptotic behavior of the solution to the case where l(x) has unbounded discontinuity. The result will be used to establish the limiting absorption principle for a class of reduced wave operators with discontinuous coefficients.
