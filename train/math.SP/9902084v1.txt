We shall investigate the asymptotic behavior of the extended resolvent R(s) of the Dirac operator as |s| increases to infinity, where s is a real parameter. It will be shown that the norm of R(s), as a bounded operator between two weighted Hilbert spaces of square integrable functions on the 3-dimensional Euclidean space, stays bounded. Also we shall show that R(s) converges 0 strongly as |s| increases to infinity. This result and a result of Yamada [15] are combined to indicate that the extended resolvent of the Dirac operator decays much more slowly than those of Schroedinger operators.
