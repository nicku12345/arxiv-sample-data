We consider a regular singular Sturm-Liouville operator L:=-\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{q(x)}{x^2 (1-x)^2} on the line segment [0,1]. We impose certain boundary conditions such that we obtain a semi-bounded self-adjoint operator. It is known that the \zeta-function of this operator \zeta_L(s)=\sum_{\lambda\in\spec(L)\setminus\{0\}} \lambda^{-s} has a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane with 0 being a regular point. Then, according to Ray and Singer the \zeta-regularized determinant of L is defined by \detz(L):=\exp(-\zeta_L'(0)). In this paper we are going to express this determinant in terms of the solutions of the homogeneous differential equation Ly=0 generalizing earlier work of S. Levit and U. Smilansky, T. Dreyfus and H. Dym, and D. Burghelea, L. Friedlander and T. Kappeler. More precisely we prove the formula \detz(L)=\frac{\pi W(\psi,\phi)} {2^{\nu_0+\nu_1} \Gamma(\nu_0+1)\Gamma(\nu_1+1)}. Here \phi, \psi is a certain fundamental system of solutions for the homogeneous equation Ly=0, W(\phi, \psi) denotes their Wronski determinant, and \nu_0, \nu_1 are numbers related to the characteristic roots of the regular singular points 0, 1.
