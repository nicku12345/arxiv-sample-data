For a class of manifolds that includes quotients of real hyperbolic space by a convex co-compact discrete group, we show that the resonances of the meromorphically continued resolvent kernel for the Laplacian coincide, with multiplicities, with the poles of the meromorphically continued scattering operator. In order to carry out the proof, we use Shmuel Agmon's perturbation theory of resonances to show that both resolvent resonances and scattering poles are simple for generic potential perturbations.
