We explore connections between Krein's spectral shift function \xi(\lambda,H_0,H) associated with the pair of self-adjoint operators (H_0,H), H=H_0+V in a Hilbert space \calH and the recently introduced concept of a spectral shift operator \Xi(J+K^*(H_0-\lambda-i0)^{-1}K) associated with the operator-valued Herglotz function J+K^*(H_0-z)^{-1}K, \Im(z)>0 in \calH, where V=KJK^* and J=\sgn(V). Our principal results include a new representation for \xi(\lambda,H_0,H) in terms of an averaged index for the Fredholm pair of self-adjoint spectral projections (E_{J+A(\lambda)+tB(\lambda)}((-\infty,0)),E_J((-\infty,0))), t\in\bbR, where A(\lambda)=\Re(K^*(H_0-\lambda-i0)^{-1}K), B(\lambda)=\Im(K^*(H_0-\lambda-i0)^{-1}K) a.e. Moreover, introducing the new concept of a trindex for a pair of operators (A,P) in \calH, where A is bounded and P is an orthogonal projection, we prove that \xi(\lambda,H_0,H) coincides with the trindex associated with the pair (\Xi(J+K^*(H_0-\lambda-i0)^{-1}K),\Xi(J)). In addition, we discuss a variant of the Birman-Krein formula relating the trindex of a pair of \Xi-operators and the Fredholm determinant of the abstract scattering matrix.   We also provide a generalization of the classical Birman-Schwinger principle, replacing the traditional eigenvalue counting functions by appropriate spectral shift functions.
