We consider discrete one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with strictly ergodic, aperiodic potentials taking finitely many values. The well-known tendency of these operators to have purely singular continuous spectrum of zero Lebesgue measure is further elucidated. We provide a unified approach to both the study of the spectral type as well as the measure of the spectrum as a set. We apply this approach to Schr\"odinger operators with Sturmian potentials. Finally, in the appendix, we discuss the two different strictly ergodic dynamical systems associated to a circle map.
