A Borg-type uniqueness theorem for matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operators is proved. More precisely, assuming a reflectionless potential matrix and spectrum a half-line [0,\infty), we derive triviality of the potential matrix. Our approach is based on trace formulas and matrix-valued Herglotz representation theorems. As a by-product of our techniques, we obtain an extension of Borg's classical result from the class of periodic scalar potentials to the class of reflectionless matrix-valued potentials.
