Our goal is to study statistical properies of "dielectric resonances" which are poles of conductance of a large random LC network. Such poles are a particular example of eigenvalues \lambda_n of matrix pencils {\bf H}-\lambda {\bf W}, with {\bf W} being positive definite matrix and {\bf H} a random real symmetric one. We first consider spectra of matrix pencils with independent, identically distributed entries of {\bf H}. Then we concentrate on an infinite-range ("full-connectivity") version of random LC network. In all cases we calculate the mean eigenvalue density and the two-point correlation function in the framework of Efetov's supersymmetry approach. Fluctuations in spectra turn out to be the same as those provided by Wigner-Dyson theory of usual random matrices.
