We study the asymptotic behavior, as Planck's constant \hbar\to 0, of the number of discrete eigenvalues and the Riesz means of Pauli and Dirac operators with a magnetic field \mu\mathbf{B}(x) and an electric field. The magnetic field strength \mu is allowed to tend to infinity as \hbar\to 0. Two main types of results are established: in the first \mu\hbar\le constant as \hbar\to 0, with magnetic fields of arbitrary direction; the second results are uniform with respect to \mu\ge 0 but the magnetic fields have constant direction. The results on the Pauli operator complement recent work of Sobolev.
