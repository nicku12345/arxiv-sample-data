We introduce the notion of scattering space S_b^r for N-body quantum mechanical systems, where b is a cluster decomposition with 2\le |b|\le N and r is a real number 0\le r\le 1. Utilizing these spaces, we give a decomposition of continuous spectral subspace by S_b^1 for N-body quantum systems with long-range pair potentials V_\alpha^L(x_\alpha)=O(|x_\al|^{-\ep}). This is extended to a decomposition by S_b^r with 0\le r\le 1 for some long-range case. We also prove a characterization of ranges of wave operators by S_b^0.
