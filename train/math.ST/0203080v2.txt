By the method of Poissonization we confirm some existing results concerning consistent estimation of the structural distribution function in the situation of a large number of rare events. Inconsistency of the so called natural estimator is proved. The method of grouping in cells of equal size is investigated and its consistency derived. A bound on the mean squared error is derived.
