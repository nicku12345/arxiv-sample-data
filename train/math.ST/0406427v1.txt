The minimax theory for estimating linear functionals is extended to the case of a finite union of convex parameter spaces. Upper and lower bounds for the minimax risk can still be described in terms of a modulus of continuity.   However in contrast to the theory for convex parameter spaces rate optimal procedures are often required to be nonlinear. A construction of such nonlinear procedures is given. The results developed in this paper have important applications to the theory of adaptation.
