I write out and discuss how one might try to prove the continuous time g-computation formula, in the simplest possible case: treatments (labelled a, for actions) and covariates (l: longitudinal data) form together a bivariate counting process. This formula is an important missing ingredient in the continuous time version of J.M. Robins' counterfactual based theory of causal inference for complex longitudinal data
