We consider estimation of the common probability density f of i.i.d. random variables X_i that are observed with an additive i.i.d. noise. We assume that the unknown density f belongs to a class \mathcal{A} of densities whose characteristic function is described by the exponent \exp(-\alpha |u|^r) as |u|\to \infty, where \alpha >0, r>0. The noise density is supposed to be known and such that its characteristic function decays as \exp(-\beta |u|^s), as |u| \to \infty, where \beta >0, s>0. Assuming that r<s, we suggest a kernel type estimator that is optimal in sharp asymptotical minimax sense on \mathcal{A} simultaneously under the pointwise and the \mathbb{L}_2-risks. The variance of the estimators turns out to be asymptotically negligible w.r.t. its squared bias. For r<s/2 we construct a sharp adaptive estimator of f. We discuss some effects of dominating bias, such as superefficiency of minimax estimators.
