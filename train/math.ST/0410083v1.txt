In the recent Bayesian nonparametric literature, many examples have been reported in which Bayesian estimators and posterior distributions do not achieve the optimal convergence rate, indicating that the Bernstein-von   Mises theorem does not hold. In this article, we give a positive result in this direction by showing that the Bernstein-von Mises theorem holds in survival models for a large class of prior processes neutral to the right. We also show that, for an arbitrarily given convergence rate n^{-\alpha} with 0<\alpha \leq 1/2, a prior process neutral to the right can be chosen so that its posterior distribution achieves the convergence rate n^{-\alpha}.
