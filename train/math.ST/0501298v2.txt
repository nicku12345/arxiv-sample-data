Arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means are the three classical means famous in the literature. Another mean such as square-root mean is also known. In this paper, we have constructed divergence measures based on nonnegative differences among these means, and established an interesting inequality by use of properties of Csiszar's f-divergence. Connections of new mean divergences measures with classical divergence measures such as Jeffreys-Kullback-Leibler J-divergence, Sibson-Burbea-Rao Jensen difference divergence measure and Taneja's arithmetic - geometric mean divergence are also established.
