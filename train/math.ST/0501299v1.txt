In this paper we shall consider one parametric generalization of some non-symmetric divergence measures. The \textit{non-symmetric divergence measures} are such as: Kullback-Leibler \textit{relative information}, \chi ^2-\textit{divergence}, \textit{relative J -- divergence}, \textit{relative Jensen -- Shannon divergence} and \textit{relative Arithmetic -- Geometric divergence}. All the generalizations considered can be written as particular cases of Csisz\'{a}r's \textit{f-divergence}. By putting some conditions on the probability distribution, the aim here is to develop bounds on these measures and their parametric generalizations.
