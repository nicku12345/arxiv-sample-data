In this paper we consider one parameter generalizations of some non - symmetric divergence measures. Measures are \textit{relative information}, \chi ^2 - \textit{divergence}, \textit{relative J-divergence}, \textit{relative Jensen-Shannon divergence}and \textit{relative arithmetic and geometric divergence}. All the generalizations considered can be written as particular cases of Csisz\'{a}r \textit{f-divergence}. By conditioning the probability distributions, relationships among the \textit{relative divergence measures}are obtained.
