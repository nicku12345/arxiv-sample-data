In this paper we derive some properties of the Bezout matrix and relate the Fisher information matrix for a stationary ARMA process to the Bezoutian. Some properties are explained via realizations in state space form of the derivatives of the white noise process with respect to the parameters. A factorization of the Fisher information matrix as a product in factors which involve the Bezout matrix of the associated AR and MA polynomials is derived.   From this factorization we can characterize singularity of the Fisher information matrix.
