In many public health problems, an important goal is to identify the effect of some treatment/intervention on the risk of failure for the whole population. A marginal proportional hazards regression model is often used to analyze such an effect. When dependent censoring is explained by many auxiliary covariates, we utilize two working models to condense high-dimensional covariates to achieve dimension reduction. Then the estimator of the treatment effect is obtained by maximizing a pseudo-likelihood function over a sieve space. Such an estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal when either of the two working models is correct; additionally, when both working models are correct, its asymptotic variance is the same as the semiparametric efficiency bound.
