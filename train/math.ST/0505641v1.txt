This paper deals exclusively with crossover designs for the purpose of comparing t test treatments with a control treatment when the number of periods is no larger than t+1. Among other results it specifies sufficient conditions for a crossover design to be simultaneously A-optimal and MV-optimal in a very large and appealing class of crossover designs. It is expected that these optimal designs are highly efficient in the entire class of crossover designs. Some computationally useful tools are given and used to build assorted small optimal and efficient crossover designs. The model robustness of these newly discovered crossover designs is discussed.
