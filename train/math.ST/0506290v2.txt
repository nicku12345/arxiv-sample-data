This paper is devoted to the introduction of a new class of consistent estimators of the fractal dimension of locally self-similar Gaussian processes. These estimators are based on convex combinations of sample quantiles of discrete variations of a sample path over a discrete grid of the interval [0,1]. We derive the almost sure convergence and the asymptotic normality for these estimators. The key-ingredient is a Bahadur representation for sample quantiles of non-linear functions of Gaussians sequences with correlation function decreasing as k^{-\alpha}L(k) for some \alpha>0 and some slowly varying function L(\cdot).
