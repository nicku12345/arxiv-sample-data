This paper studies, under the setting of spline regression, the connection between finite-sample properties of selection criteria and their asymptotic counterparts, focusing on bridging the gap between the two. We introduce a bias-variance decomposition of the prediction error, using which it is shown that in the asymptotics the bias term dominates the variability term, providing an explanation of the gap. A geometric exposition is provided for intuitive understanding. The theoretical and geometric results are illustrated through a numerical example.
