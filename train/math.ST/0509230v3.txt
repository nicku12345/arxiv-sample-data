The problem of estimating the shift (or, equivalently, the center of symmetry) of an unknown symmetric and periodic function f observed in Gaussian white noise is considered. Using the blockwise Stein method, a penalized profile likelihood with a data-driven penalization is introduced so that the estimator of the center of symmetry is defined as the maximizer of the penalized profile likelihood. This estimator has the advantage of being independent of the functional class to which the signal f si assumed to belong and, furthermore, is shown to be semiparametrically adaptive and efficient. Moreover, the second-order term of the risk expansion of the proposed estimator is proved to behave at least as well as the second-order term of the risk of the best possible estimator using monotone smoothing filter. Under mild assumptions, this estimator is shown to be second-order minimax sharp adaptive over the whole scale of Sobolev balls with smoothness \beta>1. Thus, these results extend those of \cite{DGT}, where second-order asymptotic minimaxity is proved for an estimator depending on the functional class containing f and \beta\geq 2 is required.
