We consider a time series X=\{X_k, k\in\mathbb{Z}\} with memory parameter d\in\mathbb{R}. This time series is either stationary or can be made stationary after differencing a finite number of times. We study the "Local Whittle Wavelet Estimator" of the memory parameter d. This is a wavelet-based semiparametric pseudo-likelihood maximum method estimator. The estimator may depend on a given finite range of scales or on a range which becomes infinite with the sample size. We show that the estimator is consistent and rate optimal if X is a linear process and is asymptotically normal if X is Gaussian.
