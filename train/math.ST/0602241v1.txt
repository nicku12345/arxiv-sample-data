For signals belonging to balls in smoothness classes and noise with enough moments, the asymptotic behavior of the minimax quadratic risk among soft-threshold estimates is investigated. In turn, these results, combined with a median filtering method, lead to asymptotics for denoising heavy tails via wavelet thresholding. Some further comparisons of wavelet thresholding and of kernel estimators are also briefly discussed.
