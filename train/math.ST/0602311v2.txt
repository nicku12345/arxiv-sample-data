We apply FDR thresholding to a non-Gaussian vector whose coordinates X_i, i=1,..., n, are independent exponential with individual means \mu_i. The vector \mu =(\mu_i) is thought to be sparse, with most coordinates 1 but a small fraction significantly larger than 1; roughly, most coordinates are simply `noise,' but a small fraction contain `signal.' We measure risk by per-coordinate mean-squared error in recovering \log(\mu_i), and study minimax estimation over parameter spaces defined by constraints on the per-coordinate p-norm of \log(\mu_i): \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\log^p(\mu_i)\leq \eta^p. We show for large n and small \eta that FDR thresholding can be nearly Minimax. The FDR control parameter 0<q<1 plays an important role: when q\leq 1/2, the FDR estimator is nearly minimax, while choosing a fixed q>1/2 prevents near minimaxity. These conclusions mirror those found in the Gaussian case in Abramovich et al. [Ann. Statist. 34 (2006) 584--653]. The techniques developed here seem applicable to a wide range of other distributional assumptions, other loss measures and non-i.i.d. dependency structures.
