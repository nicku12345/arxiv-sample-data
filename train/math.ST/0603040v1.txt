This paper investigates the (conditional) quasi-likelihood ratio test for the threshold in MA models. Under the hypothesis of no threshold, it is shown that the test statistic converges weakly to a function of the centred Gaussian process. Under local alternatives, it is shown that this test has nontrivial asymptotic power. The results are based on a new weak convergence of a linear marked empirical process, which is independently of interest. This paper also gives an invertible expansion of the threshold MA models.
