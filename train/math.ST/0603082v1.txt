This paper aims to generalize and unify classical criteria for comparisons of balanced lattice designs, including fractional factorial designs, supersaturated designs and uniform designs. We present a general majorization framework for assessing designs, which includes a stringent criterion of majorization via pairwise coincidences and flexible surrogates via convex functions. Classical orthogonality, aberration and uniformity criteria are unified by choosing combinatorial and exponential kernels. A construction method is also sketched out.
