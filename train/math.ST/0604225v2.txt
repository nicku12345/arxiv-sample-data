Will the United Kingdom's ageing population be fit and independent, or suffer from greater chronic ill health? Healthy life expectancy is commonly used to assess this: it is an estimate of how many years are lived in good health over the lifespan. This paper examines a means of generating estimates of healthy and unhealthy life expectancy consistent with exogenous population mortality data. The method takes population transition matrices and adjusts these in a statistically coherent way so as to render them consistent with aggregate life tables. It is applied to estimates of healthy life expectancy for the United Kingdom.
