We prove a CLT for skewness and kurtosis of the wavelets coefficients of a stationary field on the torus. The results are in the framework of the fixed-domain asymptotics, i.e. we refer to observations of a single field which is sampled at higher and higher frequencies. We consider also studentized statistics for the case of an unknown correlation structure. The results are motivated by the analysis of cosmological data or high-frequency financial data sets, with a particular interest towards testing for Gaussianity and isotropy
