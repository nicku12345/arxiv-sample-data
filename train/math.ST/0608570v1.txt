We consider the numerical evaluation of one dimensional projections of general multivariate stable densities introduced by Abdul-Hamid and Nolan (1998). In their approach higher order derivatives of one dimensional densities are used, which seem to be cumbersome in practice. Furthermore there are some difficulties for even dimensions. In order to overcome these difficulties we obtain the explicit finite-interval integral representation of one dimensional projections for all dimensions. For this purpose we utilize the imaginary part of complex integration, whose real part corresponds to the derivative of the one dimensional inversion formula. We also give summaries on relations between various parameterizations of stable multivariate density and its one dimensional projection.
