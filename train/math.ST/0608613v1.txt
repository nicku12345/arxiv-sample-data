In this paper, we study the synthesis of Gegenbauer processes using the wavelet packets transform. In order to simulate a 1-factor Gegenbauer process, we introduce an original algorithm, inspired by the one proposed by Coifman and Wickerhauser [1], to adaptively search for the best-ortho-basis in the wavelet packet library where the covariance matrix of the transformed process is nearly diagonal. Our method clearly outperforms the one recently proposed by [2], is very fast, does not depend on the wavelet choice, and is not very sensitive to the length of the time series. From these first results we propose an algorithm to build bases to simulate k-factor Gegenbauer processes. Given its practical simplicity, we feel the general practitioner will be attracted to our simulator. Finally we evaluate the approximation due to the fact that we consider the wavelet packet coefficients as uncorrelated. An empirical study is carried out which supports our results.
