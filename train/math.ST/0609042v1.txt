Many multivariate data analysis techniques for an m\times n matrix \m Y are related to the model \m Y = \m M +\m E, where \m Y is an m\times n matrix of full rank and \m M is an unobserved mean matrix of rank K< (m\wedge n). Typically the rank of \m M is estimated in a heuristic way and then the least-squares estimate of \m M is obtained via the singular value decomposition of \m Y, yielding an estimate that can have a very high variance. In this paper we suggest a model-based alternative to the above approach by providing prior distributions and posterior estimation for the rank of \m M and the components of its singular value decomposition. In addition to providing more accurate inference, such an approach has the advantage of being extendable to more general data-analysis situations, such as inference in the presence of missing data and estimation in a generalized linear modeling framework.
