This special issue is a product of the First Interdisciplinary Symposium on Statistical Challenges and Opportunities in Electronic Commerce Research, which took place on May 22--23, 2005, at the Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park (\url{www.smith.umd.edu/dit/statschallenges/}). The symposium brought together, for the first time, researchers from statistics, information systems, and related fields, all of whom work or are interested in empirical research related to electronic commerce. The goal of the symposium was to cross the borders, discuss joint research opportunities, expose this field and its statistical challenges, and promote collaboration between the different fields.
