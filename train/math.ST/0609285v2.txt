Suppose that one observes pairs (x_1,Y_1), (x_2,Y_2), ..., (x_n,Y_n), where x_1\le x_2\le ... \le x_n are fixed numbers, and Y_1,Y_2,...,Y_n are independent random variables with unknown distributions. The only assumption is that {\rm Median}(Y_i)=f(x_i) for some unknown convex function f. We present a confidence band for this regression function f using suitable multiscale sign-tests. While the exact computation of this band requires O(n^4) steps, good approximations can be obtained in O(n^2) steps. In addition the confidence band is shown to have desirable asymptotic properties as the sample size n tends to infinity.
