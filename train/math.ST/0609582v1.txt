Logistic regression with unknown sizes has many important applications in biological and medical sciences. All models about this problem in the literature are parametric ones. A semiparametric regression model is proposed. This model incorporates overdispersion due to the variation of sizes, and allows general dose-response relations. An Expectation Conditional Maximization algorithm is provided to maximize the log likelihood. The bootstrap method can be used to construct confidence intervals for regression coefficients. Simulation is performed to study the behavior of the proposed model. Two real examples are investigated by the proposed model.
