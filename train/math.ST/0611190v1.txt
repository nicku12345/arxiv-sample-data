This paper concerns estimating a probability density function f based on iid observations from g(x)=W^{-1} w(x) f(x), where the weight function w and the total weight W=\int w(x) f(x) dx may not be known. The length-biased and excess life distribution models are considered. The asymptotic normality and the rate of convergence in mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators are studied.
