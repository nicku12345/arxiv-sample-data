Consider the multiple testing problem of testing null hypotheses H_1,...,H_s. A classical approach to dealing with the multiplicity problem is to restrict attention to procedures that control the familywise error rate (\mathit{FWER}), the probability of even one false rejection. But if s is large, control of the \mathit{FWER} is so stringent that the ability of a procedure that controls the \mathit{FWER} to detect false null hypotheses is limited. It is therefore desirable to consider other measures of error control. This article considers two generalizations of the \mathit{FWER}. The first is the k-\mathit{FWER}, in which one is willing to tolerate k or more false rejections for some fixed k\geq 1. The second is based on the false discovery proportion (\mathit{FDP}), defined to be the number of false rejections divided by the total number of rejections (and defined to be 0 if there are no rejections). Benjamini and Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289--300] proposed control of the false discovery rate (\mathit{FDR}), by which they meant that, for fixed \alpha, E(\mathit{FDP})\leq\alpha. Here, we consider control of the \mathit{FDP} in the sense that, for fixed \gamma and \alpha, P\{\mathit{FDP}>\gamma\}\leq \alpha. Beginning with any nondecreasing sequence of constants and p-values for the individual tests, we derive stepup procedures that control each of these two measures of error control without imposing any assumptions on the dependence structure of the p-values. We use our results to point out a few interesting connections with some closely related stepdown procedures. We then compare and contrast two \mathit{FDP}-controlling procedures obtained using our results with the stepup procedure for control of the \mathit{FDR} of Benjamini and Yekutieli [Ann. Statist. 29 (2001) 1165--1188].
