The aim of this work is to estimate a quadratic functional of a unknown Wigner function from noisy tomographic data. The Wigner function can be seen as the representation of the quantum state of a light beam. The estimation of a quadratic functional is done from result of quantum homodyne measurement performed on identically prepared quantum systems. We start by constructing an estimator of a quadratic functional of the Wigner function. We show that the proposed estimator is optimal or nearly optimal in a minimax sense over a class of infinitely differentiable functions. Parametric rates are also reached for some values of the smoothness parameters and the asymptotic normality is given. Then, we construct an adaptive estimator that does not depend on the smoothness parameters and prove it is minimax over some set-ups.
