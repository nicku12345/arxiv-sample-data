In this paper, we study first the problem of nonparametric estimation of the stationary density f of a discrete-time Markov chain (X_i). We consider a collection of projection estimators on finite dimensional linear spaces. We select an estimator among the collection by minimizing a penalized contrast. The same technique enables to estimate the density g of (X_i, X_{i+1}) and so to provide an adaptive estimator of the transition density \pi=g/f. We give bounds in L^2 norm for these estimators and we show that they are adaptive in the minimax sense over a large class of Besov spaces. Some examples and simulations are also provided.
