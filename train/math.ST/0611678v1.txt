Let \{S_n=(X_n,W_n)\}_{n\ge0} be a random walk with X_n\in \mathbb{R} and W_n\in \mathbb{R}^m. Let \tau=\tau_a=\inf\{n:X_n>a\}. The main results presented are two term asymptotic expansions for the joint distribution of S_{\tau} and \tau and the marginal distribution of h(S_{\tau}/a,\tau/a) in the limit a\to\infty. These results are used to study the distribution of t-statistics in sequential experiments with sample size \tau, and to remove bias from confidence intervals based on Anscombe's theorem.
