In this paper a new estimator for the transition density \pi of an homogeneous Markov chain is considered. We introduce an original contrast derived from regression framework and we use a model selection method to estimate \pi under mild conditions. The resulting estimate is adaptive with an optimal rate of convergence over a large range of anisotropic Besov spaces B_{2,\infty}^{(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)}. Some simulations are also presented.
