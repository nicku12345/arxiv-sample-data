Three-stage t-tests of separated one-sided hypotheses are derived, extending Lorden's optimal three-stage tests for the one-dimensional exponential family by using Lai and Zhang's generalization of Schwarz's optimal fully-sequential tests to the multiparameter exponential family. The resulting three-stage t-tests are shown to be asymptotically optimal, achieving the same average sample size as optimal fully-sequential tests.
