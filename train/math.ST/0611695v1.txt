Non-linear renewal theory is extended to include random walks perturbed by both a slowly changing sequence and a stationary one. Main results include a version of the Key Renewal Theorem, a derivation of the limiting distribution of the excess over a boundary, and an expansion for the expected first passage time. The formulation is motivated by problems in sequential analysis with staggered entry, where subjects enter a study at random times.
