There have been extensive developments recently in modern nonparametric inference and modeling. Nonparametric and semi-parametric methods are especially useful with large amounts of data that are now routinely collected in many areas of science. Probability and stochastic modeling are also playing major new roles in scientific applications. This refereed special volume highlights challenges and developments at this interface of statistics, probability and the sciences, and honors Michael B. Woodroofe for his pioneering contributions to nonparametric inference and probability.
