Let (X,Y) be a random vector whose conditional excess probability \theta(x,y):=P(Y\leq y | X>x) is of interest. Estimating this kind of probability is a delicate problem as soon as x tends to be large, since the conditioning event becomes an extreme set. Assume that (X,Y) is elliptically distributed, with a rapidly varying radial component. In this paper, three statistical procedures are proposed to estimate \theta(x,y) for fixed x,y, with x large. They respectively make use of an approximation result of Abdous et al. (cf. Canad. J. Statist. 33 (2005) 317--334, Theorem 1), a new second order refinement of Abdous et al.'s Theorem 1, and a non-approximating method. The estimation of the conditional quantile function \theta(x,\cdot)^{\leftarrow} for large fixed x is also addressed and these methods are compared via simulations. An illustration in the financial context is also given.
