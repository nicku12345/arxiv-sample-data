We establish a functional limit law of the logarithm for the increments of the normed quantile process based upon a random sample of size n\to\infty. We extend a limit law obtained by Deheuvels and Mason (12), showing that their results hold uniformly over the bandwidth h, restricted to vary in [h'_n,h''_n], where \{h'_n\}_{n\geq1} and \{h''_n\}_{n\geq 1} are appropriate non-random sequences. We treat the case where the sample observations follow possibly non-uniform distributions. As a consequence of our theorems, we provide uniform limit laws for nearest-neighbor density estimators, in the spirit of those given by Deheuvels and Mason (13) for kernel-type estimators.
