Ulf Grenander was born in Vastervik, Sweden, on July 23, 1923. He started his undergraduate education at Uppsala University, and earned his B.A. degree in 1946, the Fil. Lic. degree in 1948 and the Fil. Dr. degree in 1950, all from the University of Stockholm. His Ph.D. thesis advisor was Harald Cram\'{e}r. Professor Grenander is well known for pathbreaking research in a number of areas including pattern theory, computer vision, inference in stochastic processes, probabilities on algebraic structures and actuarial mathematics. He has published more than one dozen influential books, of which Statistical Analysis of Stationary Time Series (1957, coauthored with M. Rosenblatt), Probabilities on Algebraic Structures (1963; also in Russian) and Abstract Inference (1981b) are regarded as classics. His three-volume lecture notes, namely, Pattern Synthesis (vol. I, 1976), Pattern Analysis (vol. II, 1978) and Regular Structures (vol. III, 1981a; also in Russian) created and nurtured a brand new area of research. During 1951--1966, Professor Grenander's career path took him to the University of Chicago (1951--1952), the University of California--Berkeley (1952--1953), the University of Stockholm (1953--1957), Brown University (1957--1958) and the Institute for Insurance Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (1958--1966) as its Professor and Director. From 1966 until his retirement he was L. Herbert Ballou University Professor at Brown University. Professor Grenander also held the position of Scientific Director (1971--1973) of the Swedish Institute of Applied Mathematics. He has earned many honors and awards, including Arhennius Fellow (1948), Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (1953), Prize of the Nordic Actuaries (1961), Arnberger Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science (1962), Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science (1965), Guggenheim Fellowship (1979) and Honorary Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, London (1989). He has delivered numerous prestigious lectures, including the Rietz Lecture (1985), the Wald Lectures (1995) and the Mahalanobis Lecture (2004). Professor Grenander received an Honorary D.Sc. degree (1993) from the University of Chicago and is a Fellow of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1995) and the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A. (1998). Professor Grenander's career, life, passion and hobbies can all be summarized by one simple word: Mathematics.
