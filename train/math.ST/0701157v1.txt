In this paper we define the concept of orthogonality between two factors "through another factor". Exploiting this property we have been able to obtain orthogonal main effect plans (OMEP) on non-orthogonal blocks requiring considerably smaller number of blocks than the existing methods. As particular cases, we have been able to accomodate four six-level factors on 8 blocks of size 4 each using the first method and on 24 runs using the second.
