A general family of estimators for estimating the population mean of the variable under study, which make use of known value of certain population parameter(s), is proposed. Under Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement (SRSWOR) scheme, the expressions of bias and mean-squared error (MSE) up to first order of approximation are derived. Some well known estimators have been shown as particular member of this family. An empirical study is carried out to illustrate the performance of the constructed estimator over others.
