This work is intended as a contribution to a wavelet-based adaptive estimator of the memory parameter in the classical semi-parametric framework for Gaussian stationary processes. In particular we introduce and develop the choice of a data-driven optimal bandwidth. Moreover, we establish a central limit theorem for the estimator of the memory parameter with the minimax rate of convergence (up to a logarithm factor). The quality of the estimators are attested by simulations.
