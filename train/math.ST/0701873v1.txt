In certain applications, for instance biomechanics, turbulence, finance, or Internet traffic, it seems suitable to model the data by a generalization of a fractional Brownian motion for which the Hurst parameter H is depending on the frequency as a piece-wise constant function. These processes are called multiscale fractional Brownian motions. In this contribution, we provide a statistical study of the multiscale fractional Brownian motions. We develop a method based on wavelet analysis. By using this method, we find initially the frequency changes, then we estimate the different parameters and afterwards we test the goodness-of-fit. Lastly, we give the numerical algorithm. Biomechanical data are then studied with these new tools.
