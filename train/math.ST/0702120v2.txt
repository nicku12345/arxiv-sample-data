An extension of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory provides a new framework for modeling functional regression models with functional responses. The approach only presumes a general nonlinear regression structure as opposed to previously studied linear regression models. Generalized cross-validation (GCV) is proposed for automatic smoothing parameter estimation. The new RKHS estimate is applied to both simulated and real data as illustrations.
