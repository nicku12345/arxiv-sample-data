We extend the approach of Walker (2003, 2004) to the case of misspecified models. A sufficient condition for establishing rates of convergence is given based on a key identity involving martingales, which does not require construction of tests. We also show roughly that the result obtained by using tests can also be obtained by our approach, which demonstrates the potential wider applicability of this method.
