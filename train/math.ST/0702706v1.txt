We study two statistical models for short-length categorical (or ordinal) time series. The first one is a regression model based on generalized linear model. The second one is a parametrized Markovian model, particularizing the discrete autoregressive model to the case of categorical data. These models are used to analyze two data-sets: annual larch cone production and weekly planktonic abundance.
