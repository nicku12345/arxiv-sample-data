Previous analysis on forecasting theory either assume knowing the true parameters or assume the stationarity of the series. Not much are known on the forecasting theory for nonstationary process with estimated parameters. This paper investigates the recursive least square forecast for stationary and nonstationary processes with unit roots. We first prove that the accumulated forecast mean square error can be decomposed into two components, one of which arises from estimation uncertainty and the other from the disturbance term. The former, of the order of \log(T), is of second order importance to the latter term, of the order T. However, since the latter is common for all predictors, it is the former that determines the property of each predictor. Our theorem implies that the improvement of forecasting precision is of the order of \log(T) when existence of unit root is properly detected and taken into account. Also, our theorem leads to a new proof of strong consistency of predictive least squares in model selection and a new test of unit root where no regression is needed. The simulation results confirm our theoretical findings. In addition, we find that while mis-specification of AR order and under-specification of the number of unit root have marginal impact on forecasting precision, over-specification of the number of unit root strongly deteriorates the quality of long term forecast. As for the empirical study using Taiwanese data, the results are mixed. Adaptive forecast and imposing unit root improve forecast precision for some cases but deteriorate forecasting precision for other cases.
