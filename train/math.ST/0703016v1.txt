First, a classification is obtained which is then used to examine the specific role of occasional jobs during a spell of unemployment and, in this context, the influence of the received unemployment benefits on the duration of this spell. This paper is a continuation of previous analyses of unemployment in France, based on long-term data from the unemployed register held by ANPE (National Employment Bureau).
