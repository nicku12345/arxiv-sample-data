This paper deals with a linear model of regression on quantiles when the explanatory variable takes values in some functional space and the response is scalar. We propose a spline estimator of the functional coefficient that minimizes a penalized L1 type criterion. Then, we study the asymptotic behavior of this estimator. The penalization is of primary importance to get existence and convergence.
