In a general fractional factorial design, the n-levels of a factor are coded by the n-th roots of the unity. This device allows a full generalization to mixed-level designs of the theory of the polynomial indicator function which has already been introduced for two level designs by Fontana and the Authors (2000). the properties of orthogonal arrays and regular fractions are discussed.
