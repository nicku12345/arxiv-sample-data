Several representations of the exact cdf of the sum of squares of n independent gamma-distributed random variables Xi are given, in particular by a series of gamma distribution functions. Using a characterization of the gamma distribution by Laha, an expansion of the exact distribution of the sample variance is derived by a Taylor series approach with the former distribution as its leading term. In particular for integer orders alpha some further series are provided, including a convex combination of gamma distributions for alpha = 1 and nearly of this type for alpha > 1. Furthermore, some representations of the distribution of the angle Phi between (X1,...,Xn) and (1,...,1) are given by orthogonal series. All these series are based on the same sequence of easily computed moments of cos(Phi).
