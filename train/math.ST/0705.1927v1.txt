We present two approaches for linear prediction of long-memory time series. The first approach consists in truncating the Wiener-Kolmogorov predictor by restricting the observations to the last k terms, which are the only available values in practice. We derive the asymptotic behaviour of the mean-squared error as k tends to  + \infty. By contrast, the second approach is non-parametric. An AR(k) model is fitted to the long-memory time series and we study the error that arises in this misspecified model.
