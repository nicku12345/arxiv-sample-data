We study an AMOC time series model with an abrupt change in the mean and dependent errors that fulfill certain mixing conditions. We obtain confidence intervals for the unknown change-point via bootstrapping methods.   Precisely we use a block bootstrap of the estimated centered error sequence. Then we reconstruct a sequence with a change in the mean using the same estimators as before. The difference between the change-point estimator of the resampled sequence and the one for the original sequence can be use as an approximation of the difference between the real change-point and its estimator. This enables us to construct confidence intervals using the empirical distribution of the resampled time series.   A simulation study shows that the resampled confidence intervals are usually closer to their target levels and at the same time smaller than the asymptotic intervals.
