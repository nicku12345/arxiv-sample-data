We derive an asymptotic theory of nonparametric estimation for a time series regression model Z_t=f(X_t)+W_t, where \ensuremath\{X_t\} and \ensuremath\{Z_t\} are observed nonstationary processes and \{W_t\} is an unobserved stationary process. In econometrics, this can be interpreted as a nonlinear cointegration type relationship, but we believe that our results are of wider interest. The class of nonstationary processes allowed for \{X_t\} is a subclass of the class of null recurrent Markov chains. This subclass contains random walk, unit root processes and nonlinear processes. We derive the asymptotics of a nonparametric estimate of f(x) under the assumption that \{W_t\} is a Markov chain satisfying some mixing conditions. The finite-sample properties of \hat{f}(x) are studied by means of simulation experiments.
