We reveal the phenomenon that ``naive'' multivariate local polynomial regression can adapt to local smooth lower dimensional structure in the sense that it achieves the optimal convergence rate for nonparametric estimation of regression functions belonging to a Sobolev space when the predictor variables live on or close to a lower dimensional manifold.
