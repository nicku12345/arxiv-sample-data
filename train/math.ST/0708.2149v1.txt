Recent results in homotopy and solution paths demonstrate that certain well-designed greedy algorithms, with a range of values of the algorithmic parameter, can provide solution paths to a sequence of convex optimization problems. On the other hand, in regression many existing criteria in subset selection (including C_p, AIC, BIC, MDL, RIC, etc.) involve optimizing an objective function that contains a counting measure. The two optimization problems are formulated as (P1) and (P0) in the present paper. The latter is generally combinatoric and has been proven to be NP-hard. We study the conditions under which the two optimization problems have common solutions. Hence, in these situations a stepwise algorithm can be used to solve the seemingly unsolvable problem. Our main result is motivated by recent work in sparse representation, while two others emerge from different angles: a direct analysis of sufficiency and necessity and a condition on the mostly correlated covariates. An extreme example connected with least angle regression is of independent interest.
