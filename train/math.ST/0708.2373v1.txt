The predictive capability of a modification of Rissanen's accumulated prediction error (APE) criterion, APE_{\delta_n}, is investigated in infinite-order autoregressive (AR(\infty)) models. Instead of accumulating squares of sequential prediction errors from the beginning, APE_{\delta_n} is obtained by summing these squared errors from stage n\delta_n, where n is the sample size and 1/n\leq \delta_n\leq 1-(1/n) may depend on n. Under certain regularity conditions, an asymptotic expression is derived for the mean-squared prediction error (MSPE) of an AR predictor with order determined by APE_{\delta_n}. This expression shows that the prediction performance of APE_{\delta_n} can vary dramatically depending on the choice of \delta_n. Another interesting finding is that when \delta_n approaches 1 at a certain rate, APE_{\delta_n} can achieve asymptotic efficiency in most practical situations. An asymptotic equivalence between APE_{\delta_n} and an information criterion with a suitable penalty term is also established from the MSPE point of view. This offers new perspectives for understanding the information and prediction-based model selection criteria. Finally, we provide the first asymptotic efficiency result for the case when the underlying AR(\infty) model is allowed to degenerate to a finite autoregression.
