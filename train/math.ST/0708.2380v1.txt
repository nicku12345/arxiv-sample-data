When considering a graphical Gaussian model {\mathcal{N}}_G Markov with respect to a decomposable graph G, the parameter space of interest for the precision parameter is the cone P_G of positive definite matrices with fixed zeros corresponding to the missing edges of G. The parameter space for the scale parameter of {\mathcal{N}}_G is the cone Q_G, dual to P_G, of incomplete matrices with submatrices corresponding to the cliques of G being positive definite. In this paper we construct on the cones Q_G and P_G two families of Wishart distributions, namely the Type I and Type II Wisharts. They can be viewed as generalizations of the hyper Wishart and the inverse of the hyper inverse Wishart as defined by Dawid and Lauritzen [Ann. Statist. 21 (1993) 1272--1317]. We show that the Type I and II Wisharts have properties similar to those of the hyper and hyper inverse Wishart. Indeed, the inverse of the Type II Wishart forms a conjugate family of priors for the covariance parameter of the graphical Gaussian model and is strong directed hyper Markov for every direction given to the graph by a perfect order of its cliques, while the Type I Wishart is weak hyper Markov. Moreover, the inverse Type II Wishart as a conjugate family presents the advantage of having a multidimensional shape parameter, thus offering flexibility for the choice of a prior.
