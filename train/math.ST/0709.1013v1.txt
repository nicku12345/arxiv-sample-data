We consider the convergence of empirical processes indexed by functions that depend on an estimated parameter \eta and give several alternative conditions under which the ``estimated parameter'' \eta_n can be replaced by its natural limit \eta_0 uniformly in some other indexing set \Theta. In particular we reconsider some examples treated by Ghoudi and Remillard [Asymptotic Methods in Probability and Statistics (1998) 171--197, Fields Inst. Commun. 44 (2004) 381--406]. We recast their examples in terms of empirical process theory, and provide an alternative general view which should be of wide applicability.
