In September 2006, Piet Groeneboom officially retired as professor of statistics at Delft University of Technology and the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. He did so by delivering his farewell lecture `Summa Cogitatio' ([42] in Piet's publication list) in the Aula of the university in Delft. To celebrate Piet's impressive contributions to statistics and probability, the workshop `Asymptotics: particles, processes and inverse problems' was held from July 10 until July 14, 2006, at the Lorentz Center in Leiden. Many leading researchers in the fields of probability and statistics gave talks at this workshop, and it became a memorable event for all who attended, including the organizers and Piet himself. This volume serves as a Festschrift for Piet Groeneboom. It contains papers that were presented at the workshop as well as some other contributions, and it represents the state of the art in the areas in statistics and probability where Piet has been (and still is) most active. Furthermore, a short CV of Piet Groeneboom and a list of his publications are included.
