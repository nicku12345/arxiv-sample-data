We investigate the posterior rate of convergence for wavelet shrinkage using a Bayesian approach in general Besov spaces. Instead of studying the Bayesian estimator related to a particular loss function, we focus on the posterior distribution itself from a nonparametric Bayesian asymptotics point of view and study its rate of convergence. We obtain the same rate as in \citet{abramovich04} where the authors studied the convergence of several Bayesian estimators.
