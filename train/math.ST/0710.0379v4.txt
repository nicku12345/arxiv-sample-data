This paper proves fixed domain asymptotic results for estimating a smooth invertible transformation f:\Bbb{R}^2\to\Bbb{R}^2 when observing the deformed random field Z\circ f on a dense grid in a bounded, simply connected domain \Omega, where Z is assumed to be an isotropic Gaussian random field on \Bbb{R}^2. The estimate \hat{f} is constructed on a simply connected domain U, such that \overline{U}\subset\Omega and is defined using kernel smoothed quadratic variations, Bergman projections and results from quasiconformal theory. We show, under mild assumptions on the random field Z and the deformation f, that \hat{f}\to R_{\theta}f+c uniformly on compact subsets of U with probability one as the grid spacing goes to zero, where R_{\theta} is an unidentifiable rotation and c is an unidentifiable translation.
