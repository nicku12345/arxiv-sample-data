Efficient estimation under bias sampling, censoring or truncation is a difficult question which has been partially answered and the usual estimators are not always consistent. Several biased designs are considered for models with variables (X,Y) where Y is an indicator and X an explanatory variable, or for continuous variables (X,Y). The identifiability of the models are discussed. New nonparametric estimators of the regression functions and conditional quantiles are proposed.
