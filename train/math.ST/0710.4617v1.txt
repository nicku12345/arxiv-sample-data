The monotone rearrrangement algorithm was introduced by Hardy, Littlewood and P\'olya as a sorting device for functions. Assuming that x is a monotone function and that an estimate x_n of x is given, consider the monotone rearrangement \hat{x}_n of x_n. This new estimator is shown to be uniformly consistent. Under suitable assumptions, pointwise limit distribution results for \hat{x}_n are obtained. The framework is general and allows for weakly dependent and long range dependent stationary data. Applications in monotone density and regression function estimation are detailed.
