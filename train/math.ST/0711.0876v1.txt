Let \mathbf {X}=\{X_t, t=1,2,... \} be a stationary Gaussian random process, with mean EX_t=\mu and covariance function \gamma(\tau)=E(X_t-\mu)(X_{t+\tau}-\mu). Let f(\lambda) be the corresponding spectral density; a stationary Gaussian process is said to be long-range dependent, if the spectral density f(\lambda) can be written as the product of a slowly varying function \tilde{f}(\lambda) and the quantity \lambda ^{-2d}. In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to the estimation of the spectral density of \mathbf {X}. We prove that, under some specific assumptions on the prior distribution, our approach assures posterior consistency both when f(\cdot) and d are the objects of interest. The rate of convergence of the posterior sequence depends in a significant way on the structure of the prior; we provide some general results and also consider the fractionally exponential (FEXP) family of priors (see below). Since it has not a well founded justification in the long memory set-up, we avoid using the Whittle approximation to the likelihood function and prefer to use the true Gaussian likelihood.
