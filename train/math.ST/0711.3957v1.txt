We investigate the moment estimation for an ergodic diffusion process with unknown trend coefficient. We consider nonparametric and parametric estimation. In each case, we present a lower bound for the risk and then construct an asymptotically efficient estimator of the moment type functional or of a parameter which has a one-to-one correspondence to such a functional. Next, we clarify a higher order property of the moment type estimator by the Edgeworth expansion of the distribution function.
