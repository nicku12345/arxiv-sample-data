We derive an asymptotic power function for a likelihood-based test for interaction in a regression model, with possibly misspecified alternative distribution. This allows a general investigation of types of interactions which are poorly or well detected via data. Principally we contrast pairwise-interaction models with `diffuse interaction models' as introduced in Gustafson, Kazi, and Levy (2005).
