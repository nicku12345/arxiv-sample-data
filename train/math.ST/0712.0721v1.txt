A family of variable stage size multistage tests of simple hypotheses is described, based on efficient multistage sampling procedures. Using a loss function that is a linear combination of sampling costs and error probabilities, these tests are shown to minimize the integrated risk to second order as the costs per stage and per observation approach zero. A numerical study shows significant improvement over group sequential tests in a binomial testing problem.
