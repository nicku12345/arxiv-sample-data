In this paper, an estimator of m instants (m is known) of abrupt changes of the parameter of long-range dependence or self-similarity is proved to satisfy a limit theorem with an explicit convergence rate for a sample of a Gaussian process. In each estimated zone where the parameter is supposed not to change, a central limit theorem is established for the parameter's (of long-range dependence, self-similarity) estimator and a goodness-of-fit test is also built. {\it To cite this article: J.M.
