Parameter estimation in a class of heteroscedastic time series models is investigated. The existence of conditional least-squares and conditional likelihood estimators is proved. Their consistency and their asymptotic normality are established. Kernel estimators of the noise's density and its derivatives are defined and shown to be uniformly consistent. A simulation experiment conducted shows that the estimators perform well for large sample size.
