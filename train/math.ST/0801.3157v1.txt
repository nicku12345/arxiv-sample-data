The purpose of this paper is to estimate the intensity of a Poisson process N by using thresholding rules. In this paper, the intensity, defined as the derivative of the mean measure of N with respect to ndx where n is a fixed parameter, is assumed to be non-compactly supported. The estimator \tilde{f}_{n,\gamma} based on random thresholds is proved to achieve the same performance as the oracle estimator up to a logarithmic term. Oracle inequalities allow to derive the maxiset of \tilde{f}_{n,\gamma}. Then, minimax properties of \tilde{f}_{n,\gamma} are established. We first prove that the rate of this estimator on Besov spaces {\cal B}^\al_{p,q} when p\leq 2 is (\ln(n)/n)^{\al/(1+2\al)}. This result has two consequences. First, it establishes that the minimax rate of Besov spaces {\cal B}^\al_{p,q} with p\leq 2 when non compactly supported functions are considered is the same as for compactly supported functions up to a logarithmic term. This result is new. Furthermore, \tilde{f}_{n,\gamma} is adaptive minimax up to a logarithmic term. When p>2, the situation changes dramatically and the rate of \tilde{f}_{n,\gamma} on Besov spaces {\cal B}^\al_{p,q} is worse than (\ln(n)/n)^{\al/(1+2\al)}. Finally, the random threshold depends on a parameter \gamma that has to be suitably chosen in practice. Some theoretical results provide upper and lower bounds of \gamma to obtain satisfying oracle inequalities. Simulations reinforce these results.
