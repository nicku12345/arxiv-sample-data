Let \{(X_i,Y_i)\}_{i\in \{1,..., n\}} be an i.i.d. sample from the random design regression model Y=f(X)+\epsilon with (X,Y)\in [0,1]\times [-M,M]. In dealing with such a model, adaptation is naturally to be intended in terms of L^2([0,1],G_X) norm where G_X(\cdot) denotes the (known) marginal distribution of the design variable X. Recently much work has been devoted to the construction of estimators that adapts in this setting (see, for example, [5,24,25,32]), but only a few of them come along with a easy--to--implement computational scheme. Here we propose a family of estimators based on the warped wavelet basis recently introduced by Picard and Kerkyacharian [36] and a tree-like thresholding rule that takes into account the hierarchical (across-scale) structure of the wavelet coefficients. We show that, if the regression function belongs to a certain class of approximation spaces defined in terms of G_X(\cdot), then our procedure is adaptive and converge to the true regression function with an optimal rate. The results are stated in terms of excess probabilities as in [19].
