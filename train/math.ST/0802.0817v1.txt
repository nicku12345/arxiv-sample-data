The paper concerns the asymptotic distribution of the mixture density estimator, proposed by Oppenheim et al 2006, in the aggregation/disaggregation problem of random parameter AR(1) process. We prove that, under mild conditions on the (semiparametric) form of the mixture density, the estimator is asymptotically normal. The proof is based on the limit theory for the quadratic form in linear random variables developed by Bhansali et al 2007. The moving average representation of the aggregated process is investigated. A small simulation study illustrates the result.
