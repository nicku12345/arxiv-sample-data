Consider the following local empirical process indexed by K\in \mathcal{G}, for fixed h>0 and z\in \mathbb{R}^d: G_n(K,h,z):=\sum_{i=1}^n K \Bigl(\frac{Z_i-z}{h^{1/d}}\Big) - \mathbbE \Bigl(K \Bigl(\frac{Z_i-z}{h^{1/d}}\Big)\Big), where the Z_i are i.i.d. on \mathbb{R}^d. We provide an extension of a result of Mason (2004). Namely, under mild conditions on \mathcal{G} and on the law of Z_1, we establish a uniform functional limit law for the collections of processes \bigl\{G_n(\cdot,h_n,z), z\in H, h\in [h_n,\mathfrak{h}_n]\big\}, where H\subset \mathbb{R}^d is a compact set with nonempty interior and where h_n and \mathfrak{h}_n satisfy the Cs\"{o}rg\H{o}-R\'{e}v\'{e}sz-Stute conditions.
