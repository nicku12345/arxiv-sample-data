In this paper, we study the behavior of a kernel estimator of the regression function in the right censored model with \alpha-mixing data . The uniform strong consistency over a real compact set of the estimate is established along with a rate of convergence. Some simulations are carried out to illustrate the behavior of the estimate with different examples for finite sample sizes.
