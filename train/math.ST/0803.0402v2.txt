In this paper we introduce an influence measure based on second order expansion of the RV and GCD measures for the comparison between unperturbed and perturbed eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix estimator. Example estimators are considered to highlight how this measure compliments recent influence analysis. Importantly, we also show how a sample based version of this measure can be used to accurately and efficiently detect influential observations in practice.
