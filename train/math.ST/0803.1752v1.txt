In this article, the weighted empirical likelihood is applied to a general setting of two-sample semiparametric models, which includes biased sampling models and case-control logistic regression models as special cases. For various types of censored data, such as right censored data, doubly censored data, interval censored data and partly interval-censored data, the weighted empirical likelihood-based semiparametric maximum likelihood estimator (\tilde{\theta}_n,\tilde{F}_n) for the underlying parameter \theta_0 and distribution F_0 is derived, and the strong consistency of (\tilde{\theta}_n,\tilde{F}_n) and the asymptotic normality of \tilde{\theta}_n are established. Under biased sampling models, the weighted empirical log-likelihood ratio is shown to have an asymptotic scaled chi-squared distribution for censored data aforementioned. For right censored data, doubly censored data and partly interval-censored data, it is shown that \sqrt{n}(\tilde{F}_n-F_0) weakly converges to a centered Gaussian process, which leads to a consistent goodness-of-fit test for the case-control logistic regression models.
