A popular framework for false discovery control is the random effects model in which the null hypotheses are assumed to be independent. This paper generalizes the random effects model to a conditional dependence model which allows dependence between null hypotheses. The dependence can be useful to characterize the spatial structure of the null hypotheses. Asymptotic properties of false discovery proportions and numbers of rejected hypotheses are explored and a large-sample distributional theory is obtained.
