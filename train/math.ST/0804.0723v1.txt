This paper presents a new approach to the estimation of the deformation of an isotropic Gaussian random field on \mathbb{R}^2 based on dense observations of a single realization of the deformed random field. Under this framework we investigate the identification and estimation of deformations. We then present a complete methodological package--from model assumptions to algorithmic recovery of the deformation--for the class of nonstationary processes obtained by deforming isotropic Gaussian random fields.
