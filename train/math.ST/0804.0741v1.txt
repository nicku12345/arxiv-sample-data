In sequential change detection, existing performance measures differ significantly in the way they treat the time of change. By modeling this quantity as a random time, we introduce a general framework capable of capturing and better understanding most well-known criteria and also propose new ones. For a specific new criterion that constitutes an extension to Lorden's performance measure, we offer the optimum structure for detecting a change in the constant drift of a Brownian motion and a formula for the corresponding optimum performance.
