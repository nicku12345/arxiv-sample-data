We consider a semiparametric convolution model. We observe random variables having a distribution given by the convolution of some unknown density f and some partially known noise density g. In this work, g is assumed exponentially smooth with stable law having unknown self-similarity index s. In order to ensure identifiability of the model, we restrict our attention to polynomially smooth, Sobolev-type densities f, with smoothness parameter \beta. In this context, we first provide a consistent estimation procedure for s. This estimator is then plugged-into three different procedures: estimation of the unknown density f, of the functional \int f^2 and goodness-of-fit test of the hypothesis H_0:f=f_0, where the alternative H_1 is expressed with respect to \mathbb {L}_2-norm (i.e. has the form \psi_n^{-2}\|f-f_0\|_2^2\ge \mathcal{C}). These procedures are adaptive with respect to both s and \beta and attain the rates which are known optimal for known values of s and \beta. As a by-product, when the noise density is known and exponentially smooth our testing procedure is optimal adaptive for testing Sobolev-type densities. The estimating procedure of s is illustrated on synthetic data.
