In the framework of noisy quantum homodyne tomography with efficiency parameter 0 < \eta \leq 1, we propose two estimators of a quantum state whose density matrix elements \rho_{m,n} decrease like e^{-B(m+n)^{r/ 2}}, for fixed known B>0 and 0<r\leq 2. The first procedure estimates the matrix coefficients by a projection method on the pattern functions (that we introduce here for 0<\eta \leq 1/2), the second procedure is a kernel estimator of the associated Wigner function. We compute the convergence rates of these estimators, in \mathbb{L}_2 risk.
