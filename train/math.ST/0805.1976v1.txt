Let X_n=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i\epsilon_{n-i}, where the \epsilon_i are i.i.d. with mean 0 and at least finite second moment, and the a_i are assumed to satisfy |a_i|=O(i^{-\beta}) with \beta >1/2. When 1/2<\beta<1, X_n is usually called a long-range dependent or long-memory process. For a certain class of Borel functions K(x_1,...,x_{d+1}), d\ge0, from {\mathcal{R}}^{d+1} to \mathcal{R}, which includes indicator functions and polynomials, the stationary sequence K(X_n,X_{n+1},...,X_{n+d}) is considered. By developing a finite orthogonal expansion of K(X_n,...,X_{n+d}), the Berry--Esseen type bounds for the normalized sum Q_N/\sqrt{N},Q_N=\sum_{n=1}^N(K(X_ n,...,X_{n+d})-\mathrm{E}K(X_n,...,X_{n+d})) are obtained when Q_N/\sqrt{N} obeys the central limit theorem with positive limiting variance.
