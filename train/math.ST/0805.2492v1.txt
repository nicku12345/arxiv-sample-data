One of Pranab K. Sen's major research areas is sequential nonparametrics and semiparametrics and their applications to clinical trials, to which he has made many important contributions. Herein we review a number of these contributions and related developments. We also describe some recent work on nonparametric and semiparametric inference and the associated computational methods in time-sequential clinical trials with survival endpoints.
