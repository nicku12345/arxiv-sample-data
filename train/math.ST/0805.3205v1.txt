In the subjective Bayesian approach uncertainty is described by a prior distribution chosen by the statistician. Fuzzy set theory is another way of representing uncertainty. Here we give a decision theoretic approach which allows a Bayesian to convert their prior distribution into a fuzzy set membership function. This yields a formal relationship between these two different methods of expressing uncertainty.
