In this paper, we derive a probability density function that generalizes the Burr XII distribution. The cumulative distribution function and the n^{th} moment of the generalized distribution are obtained while the distribution of some order statistics of the distribution are established. A theorem that relate the new distribution to another statistical distribution is established.
