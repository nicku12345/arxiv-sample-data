It is well known that generalized models is attracting the attention of researchers in recent times because of their flexibilities. Particularly, the logistic model has been generalized and applied by many authors while the half logistic distribution has not recieve much attention in term of its generalization. In this paper, we considered a generalized form of half logistic model called type III generalized half logistic distribution. We obtained its probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, the n^{th} moment, the median, the mode, the 100p-percentage points and the order statistics of the generalized distribution are established.
