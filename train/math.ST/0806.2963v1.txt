We propose a class of locally and asymptotically optimal tests, based on multivariate ranks and signs for the homogeneity of scatter matrices in m elliptical populations. Contrary to the existing parametric procedures, these tests remain valid without any moment assumptions, and thus are perfectly robust against heavy-tailed distributions (validity robustness). Nevertheless, they reach semiparametric efficiency bounds at correctly specified elliptical densities and maintain high powers under all (efficiency robustness). In particular, their normal-score version outperforms traditional Gaussian likelihood ratio tests and their pseudo-Gaussian robustifications under a very broad range of non-Gaussian densities including, for instance, all multivariate Student and power-exponential distributions.
