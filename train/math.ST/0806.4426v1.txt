In the present paper a generalization of Gurland distribution [3] is obtained as a beta mixture of the generalized Poisson distribution (GPD) of Consul and Jain [2]. The first two moments of the distribution and a recurrence relation among probabilities are obtained. The present distribution is supposed to be more general in nature and wider in scope.
