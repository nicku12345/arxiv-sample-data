An important tool for statistical research are moment inequalities for sums of independent random vectors. Nemirovski and coworkers (1983, 2000) derived one particular type of such inequalities: For certain Banach spaces (\B,\|\cdot\|) there exists a constant K = K(\B,\|\cdot\|) such that for arbitrary independent and centered random vectors X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \in \B, their sum S_n satisfies the inequality  E \|S_n \|^2 \le K \sum_{i=1}^n E \|X_i\|^2. We present and compare three different approaches to obtain such inequalities: Nemirovski's results are based on deterministic inequalities for norms. Another possible vehicle are type and cotype inequalities, a tool from probability theory on Banach spaces. Finally, we use a truncation argument plus Bernstein's inequality to obtain another version of the moment inequality above. Interestingly, all three approaches have their own merits.
