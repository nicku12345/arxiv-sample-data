Given a discrete time sample X_1,... X_n from a L\'evy process X=(X_t)_{t\geq 0} of a finite jump activity, we study the problem of nonparametric estimation of the characteristic triplet (\gamma,\sigma^2,\rho) corresponding to the process X. Based on Fourier inversion and kernel smoothing, we propose estimators of \gamma,\sigma^2 and \rho and study their asymptotic behaviour. The obtained results include derivation of upper bounds on the mean square error of the estimators of \gamma and \sigma^2 and an upper bound on the mean integrated square error of an estimator of \rho.
