We consider an estimator \hbbeta_n(t) defined as the element \bphi\in\bPhi minimizing a contrast process \pencontrast(\bphi, t) for each t. We give some general results for deriving the weak convergence of \sqrt{n}(\hbbeta_n-\bbeta) in the space of bounded functions, where, for each t, \bbeta(t) is the \bphi\in\bPhi minimizing the limit of \pencontrast(\bphi, t) as n\to\infty. These results are applied in the context of penalized M-estimation, that is, when \pencontrast(\bphi, t)=M_n(\bphi)+ t J_n(\bphi), where M_n is a usual contrast process and J_n a penalty such as the \ell^1 norm or the squared \ell^2 norm. The function \hbbeta_n is then called a \emph{regularization path}. For instance we show that the central limit theorem established for the lasso estimator in Knight and Fu (2000) continues to hold in a functional sense for the regularization path. Other examples include various possible contrast processes for M_n such as those considered in Pollard (1985).
