We consider the problem of pointwise estimation of multi-dimensional signals s, from noisy observations (y_\tau) on the regular grid \bZd. Our focus is on the adaptive estimation in the case when the signal can be well recovered using a (hypothetical) linear filter, which can depend on the unknown signal itself.   The basic setting of the problem we address here can be summarized as follows: suppose that the signal s is "well-filtered", i.e. there exists an adapted time-invariant linear filter q^*_T with the coefficients which vanish outside the "cube" \{0,..., T\}^d which recovers s_0 from observations with small mean-squared error. We suppose that we do not know the filter q^*, although, we do know that such a filter exists. We give partial answers to the following questions: -- is it possible to construct an adaptive estimator of the value s_0, which relies upon observations and recovers s_0 with basically the same estimation error as the unknown filter q^*_T? -- how rich is the family of well-filtered (in the above sense) signals?   We show that the answer to the first question is affirmative and provide a numerically efficient construction of a nonlinear adaptive filter. Further, we establish a simple calculus of "well-filtered" signals, and show that their family is quite large: it contains, for instance, sampled smooth signals, sampled modulated smooth signals and sampled harmonic functions.
