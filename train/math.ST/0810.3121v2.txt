The paper discusses the estimation of a continuous density function of the target random field X_{\bf{i}}, \bf{i}\in \mathbb {Z}^N which is contaminated by measurement errors. In particular, the observed random field Y_{\bf{i}}, \bf{i}\in \mathbb {Z}^N is such that Y_{\bf{i}}=X_{\bf{i}}+\epsilon_{\bf{i}}, where the random error \epsilon_{\bf{i}} is from a known distribution and independent of the target random field. Compared to the existing results, the paper is improved in two directions. First, the random vectors in contrast to univariate random variables are investigated. Second, a random field with a certain spatial interactions instead of i. i. d. random variables is studied. Asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator is established under appropriate conditions.
