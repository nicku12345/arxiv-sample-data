Under left truncation, data (X_i,Y_i) are observed only when Y_i\le X_i. Usually, the distribution function F of the X_i is the target of interest. In this paper, we study linear functionals \int\varphi \mathrm{d}F_n of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of F, the Lynden-Bell estimator F_n. A useful representation of \int \varphi \mathrm{d}F_n is derived which yields asymptotic normality under optimal moment conditions on the score function \varphi. No continuity assumption on F is required. As a by-product, we obtain the distributional convergence of the Lynden-Bell empirical process on the whole real line.
