The purpose of this paper is to estimate the intensity of a Poisson process N by using thresholding rules. In this paper, the intensity, defined as the derivative of the mean measure of N with respect to ndx where n is a fixed parameter, is assumed to be non-compactly supported. The estimator \tilde{f}_{n,\gamma} based on random thresholds is proved to achieve the same performance as the oracle estimator up to a possible logarithmic term. Then, minimax properties of \tilde{f}_{n,\gamma} on Besov spaces {\cal B}^{\ensuremath \alpha}_{p,q} are established. Under mild assumptions, we prove that \sup_{f\in B^{\ensuremath \alpha}_{p,q}\cap \ensuremath \mathbb {L}_{\infty}} \ensuremath \mathbb {E}(\ensuremath | | \tilde{f}_{n,\gamma}-f| |_2^2)\leq C(\frac{\log n}{n})^{\frac{\ensuremath \alpha}{\ensuremath \alpha+{1/2}+({1/2}-\frac{1}{p})_+}} and the lower bound of the minimax risk for {\cal B}^{\ensuremath \alpha}_{p,q}\cap \ensuremath \mathbb {L}_{\infty} coincides with the previous upper bound up to the logarithmic term. This new result has two consequences. First, it establishes that the minimax rate of Besov spaces {\cal B}^{\ensuremath \alpha}_{p,q} with p\leq 2 when non compactly supported functions are considered is the same as for compactly supported functions up to a logarithmic term. When p>2, the rate exponent, which depends on p, deteriorates when p increases, which means that the support plays a harmful role in this case. Furthermore, \tilde{f}_{n,\gamma} is adaptive minimax up to a logarithmic term.
