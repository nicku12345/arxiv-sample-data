In the focus of our attention is the asymptotic properties of the sequence of convex hulls which arise as a result of a peeling procedure applied to the convex hull generated by a Poisson point process. Processes of the considered type are tightly connected with empirical point processes and stable random vectors. Results are given about the limit shape of the convex hulls in the case of a discrete spectral measure. We give some numerical experiments to illustrate the peeling procedure for a more large class of Poisson point processes.
