This paper proposes a closed-form optimal estimator based on the theory of estimating functions for a class of linear ARCH models. The estimating function (EF) estimator has the advantage over the widely used maximum likelihood (ML) and quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimators that (i) it can be easily implemented, (ii) it does not depend on a distributional assumption for the innovation, and (iii) it does not require the use of any numerical optimization procedures or the choice of initial values of the conditional variance equation. In the case of normality, the asymptotic distribution of the ML and QML estimators naturally turn out to be identical and, hence, coincides with ours. Moreover, a robustness property of the EF estimator is derived by means of influence function. Simulation results show that the efficiency benefits of our estimator relative to the ML and QML estimators are substantial for some ARCH innovation distributions.
