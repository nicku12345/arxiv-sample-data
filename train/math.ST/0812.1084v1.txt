The last decade has seen a remarkable development in the theory of asymptotics of Bayesian nonparametric procedures. Exponential consistency has played an important role in this area. It is known that the condition of f_0 being in the Kullback-Leibler support of the prior cannot ensure exponential consistency of posteriors. Many authors have obtained additional sufficient conditions for exponential consistency of posteriors, see, for instance, Schwartz (1965), Barron, Schervish and Wasserman (1999), Ghosal, Ghosh and Ramamoorthi (1999), Walker (2004), Xing and Ranneby (2008). However, given the Kullback-Leibler support condition, less is known about both necessary and sufficient conditions. In this paper we give one type of both necessary and sufficient conditions. As a consequence we derive a simple sufficient condition on Bayesian exponential consistency, which is weaker than the previous sufficient conditions.
