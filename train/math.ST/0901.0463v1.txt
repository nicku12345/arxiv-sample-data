The law of likelihood underlies a general framework, known as the likelihood paradigm, for representing and interpreting statistical evidence. As stated, the law applies only to simple hypotheses, and there have been reservations about extending the law to composite hypotheses, despite their tremendous relevance in statistical applications. This paper proposes a generalization of the law of likelihood for composite hypotheses. The generalized law is developed in an axiomatic fashion, illustrated with real examples, and examined in an asymptotic analysis. Previous concerns about including composite hypotheses in the likelihood paradigm are discussed in light of the new developments. The generalized law of likelihood is compared with other likelihood-based methods and its practical implications are noted. Lastly, a discussion is given on how to use the generalized law to interpret published results of hypothesis tests as reduced data when the full data are not available.
