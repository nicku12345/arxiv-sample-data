We study the characteristics of the Pickands' dependence function for bivariate extreme distribution for minima, BEVM, when considering the stochastics ordering of the two variables. The existing Pickand's dependence function terminologies and theories are modified to suit the dependence functions of extreme cases. We successful implement and apply these functions to our simulate extreme data
