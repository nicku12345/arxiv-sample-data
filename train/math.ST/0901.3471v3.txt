We propose two estimators of a monotone spectral density, that are based on the periodogram. These are the isotonic regression of the periodogram and the isotonic regression of the log-periodogram. We derive pointwise limit distribution results for the proposed estimators for short memory linear processes and long memory Gaussian processes and also that the estimators are rate optimal.
