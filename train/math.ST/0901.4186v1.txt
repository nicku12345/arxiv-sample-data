In this paper we consider a random variable Y contamined by an independent additive noise Z. We assume that Z has known distribution. Our purpose is to test the distribution of the unobserved random variable Y. We propose a data driven statistic based on a development of the density of Y+Z, which is valid in the discrete case and in the continuous case. The test is illustrated in both cases.
