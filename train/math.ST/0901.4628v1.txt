We consider independent random variables (r.v.'s) with a common mean \mu that either satisfy Lindeberg's condition, or are symmetric around \mu. Present forms of existing functional central limit theorems (FCLT's) for Studentized partial sums of such r.v.'s on D[0,1] are seen to be of some use for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals, or what we call functional asymptotic confidence intervals (FACI's), for \mu. In this paper we establish completely data-based versions of these FCLT's and thus extend their applicability in this regard. Two special examples of new FACI's for \mu are presented.
