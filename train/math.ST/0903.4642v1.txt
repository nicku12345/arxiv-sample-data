We present a review of several results concerning the construction of the Cramer-von Mises and Kolmogorov-Smirnov type goodness-of-fit tests for continuous time processes. As the models we take a stochastic differential equation with small noise, ergodic diffusion process, Poisson process and self-exciting point processes. For every model we propose the tests which provide the asymptotic size \alpha  and discuss the behaviour of the power function under local alternatives. The results of numerical simulations of the tests are presented.
