We consider a diffusion (\xi_t)_{t\ge 0} with some T-periodic time dependent input term contained in the drift: under an unknown parameter \vth\in\Theta, some discontinuity - an additional periodic signal - occurs at times kT{+}\vth, k\in\bbn. Assuming positive Harris recurrence of (\xi_{kT})_{k\in\bbn_0} and exploiting the periodicity structure, we prove limit theorems for certain martingales and functionals of the process (\xi_t)_{t\ge 0}. They allow to consider the statistical model parametrized by \vth\in\Theta locally in small neighbourhoods of some fixed \vth, with radius 1/n as \nto. We prove convergence of local models to a limit experiment studied by Ibragimov and Khasminskii [IH 81] and discuss the behaviour of estimators under contiguous alternatives.
