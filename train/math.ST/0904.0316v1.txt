A prevalent problem in general state-space models is the approximation of the smoothing distribution of a state, or a sequence of states, conditional on the observations from the past, the present, and the future. The aim of this paper is to provide a rigorous foundation for the calculation, or approximation, of such smoothed distributions, and to analyse in a common unifying framework different schemes to reach this goal. Through a cohesive and generic exposition of the scientific literature we offer several novel extensions allowing to approximate joint smoothing distribution in the most general case with a cost growing linearly with the number of particles.
