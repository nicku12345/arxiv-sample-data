The estimation of a probability p from repeated Bernoulli trials is considered in this paper. A sequential approach is followed, using a simple stopping rule. A closed-form expression and an upper bound are obtained for the mean absolute error of the unbiased estimator of p. The results given permit the estimation of an arbitrary probability with a prescribed level of normalized mean absolute error.
