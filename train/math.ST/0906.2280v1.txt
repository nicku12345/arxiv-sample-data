The purpose of this paper is to extend the investigation of Poisson-type deviation inequalities started by Joulin (Bernoulli 13 (2007) 782--798) to the empirical mean of positively curved Markov jump processes. In particular, our main result generalizes the tail estimates given by Lezaud (Ann. Appl. Probab. 8 (1998) 849--867, ESAIM Probab. Statist. 5 (2001) 183--201). An application to birth--death processes completes this work.
