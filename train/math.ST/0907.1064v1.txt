Some tools and ideas are interchanged between random matrix theory and multivariate statistics. In the context of the random matrix theory, classes of spherical and generalised Wishart random matrix ensemble, containing as particular cases the classical random matrix ensembles, are proposed. Some properties of these classes of ensemble are analysed. In addition, the random matrix ensemble approach is extended and a unified theory proposed for the study of distributions for real normed division algebras in the context of multivariate statistics.
