We study generalized density-based clustering in which sharply defined clusters such as clusters on lower-dimensional manifolds are allowed. We show that accurate clustering is possible even in high dimensions. We propose two data-based methods for choosing the bandwidth and we study the stability properties of density clusters. We show that a simple graph-based algorithm successfully approximates the high density clusters.
