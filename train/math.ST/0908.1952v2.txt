We provide a new algorithm for the treatment of the deconvolution problem on the sphere which combines the traditional SVD inversion with an appropriate thresholding technique in a well chosen new basis. We establish upper bounds for the behavior of our procedure for any \mathbb {L}_p loss. It is important to emphasize the adaptation properties of our procedures with respect to the regularity (sparsity) of the object to recover as well as to inhomogeneous smoothness. We also perform a numerical study which proves that the procedure shows very promising properties in practice as well.
