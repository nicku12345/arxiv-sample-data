The problem we concentrate on is as follows: given (1) a convex compact set X in {\mathbb{R}}^n, an affine mapping x\mapsto A(x), a parametric family \{p_{\mu}(\cdot)\} of probability densities and (2) N i.i.d. observations of the random variable \omega, distributed with the density p_{A(x)}(\cdot) for some (unknown) x\in X, estimate the value g^Tx of a given linear form at x. For several families \{p_{\mu}(\cdot)\} with no additional assumptions on X and A, we develop computationally efficient estimation routines which are minimax optimal, within an absolute constant factor. We then apply these routines to recovering x itself in the Euclidean norm.
