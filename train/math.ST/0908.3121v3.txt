Given a sample from a discretely observed L\'evy process X=(X_t)_{t\geq 0} of the finite jump activity, the problem of nonparametric estimation of the L\'evy density \rho corresponding to the process X is studied. An estimator of \rho is proposed that is based on a suitable inversion of the L\'evy-Khintchine formula and a plug-in device. The main results of the paper deal with upper risk bounds for estimation of \rho over suitable classes of L\'evy triplets. The corresponding lower bounds are also discussed.
