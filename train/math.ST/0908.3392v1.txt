We consider the problem of estimating the slope parameter in circular functional linear regression, where scalar responses Y1,...,Yn are modeled in dependence of 1-periodic, second order stationary random functions X1,...,Xn. We consider an orthogonal series estimator of the slope function, by replacing the first m theoretical coefficients of its development in the trigonometric basis by adequate estimators. Wepropose a model selection procedure for m in a set of admissible values, by defining a contrast function minimized by our estimator and a theoretical penalty function; this first step assumes the degree of ill posedness to be known. Then we generalize the procedure to a random set of admissible m's and a random penalty function. The resulting estimator is completely data driven and reaches automatically what is known to be the optimal minimax rate of convergence, in term of a general weighted L2-risk. This means that we provide adaptive estimators of both the slope function and its derivatives.
