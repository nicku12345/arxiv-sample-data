This paper generalizes a part of the theory of Z-estimation which has been developed mainly in the context of modern empirical processes to the case of stochastic processes, typically, semimartingales. We present a general theorem to derive the asymptotic behavior of the solution to an estimating equation \theta\leadsto \Psi_n(\theta,\widehat{h}_n)=0 with an abstract nuisance parameter h when the compensator of \Psi_n is random. As its application, we consider the estimation problem in an ergodic diffusion process model where the drift coefficient contains an unknown, finite-dimensional parameter \theta and the diffusion coefficient is indexed by a nuisance parameter h from an infinite-dimensional space. An example for the nuisance parameter space is a class of smooth functions. We establish the asymptotic normality and efficiency of a Z-estimator for the drift coefficient. As another application, we present a similar result also in an ergodic time series model.
