Regular factorial designs with randomization restrictions are widely used in practice. This paper provides a unified approach to the construction of such designs using randomization defining contrast subspaces for the representation of randomization restrictions. We use finite projective geometry to determine the existence of designs with the required structure and develop a systematic approach for their construction. An attractive feature is that commonly used factorial designs with randomization restrictions are special cases of this general representation. Issues related to the use of these designs for particular factorial experiments are also addressed.
