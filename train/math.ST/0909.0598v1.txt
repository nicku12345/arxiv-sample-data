New types of designs called nested space-filling designs have been proposed for conducting multiple computer experiments with different levels of accuracy. In this article, we develop several approaches to constructing such designs. The development of these methods also leads to the introduction of several new discrete mathematics concepts, including nested orthogonal arrays and nested difference matrices.
