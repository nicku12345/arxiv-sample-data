Several important properties of positive semidefinite processes of Ornstein--Uhlenbeck type are analysed. It is shown that linear operators of the form X\mapsto AX+XA^{\mathrm{T}} with A\in M_d(\mathbb{R}) are the only ones that can be used in the definition provided one demands a natural non-degeneracy condition. Furthermore, we analyse the absolute continuity properties of the stationary distribution (especially when the driving matrix subordinator is the quadratic variation of a d-dimensional L\'{e}vy process) and study the question of how to choose the driving matrix subordinator in order to obtain a given stationary distribution. Finally, we present results on the first and second order moment structure of matrix subordinators, which is closely related to the moment structure of positive semidefinite Ornstein--Uhlenbeck type processes. The latter results are important for method of moments based estimation.
