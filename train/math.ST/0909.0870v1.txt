Expansions are provided for the moments of the number of collisions X_n in the \beta(2,b)-coalescent restricted to the set \{1,...,n\}. We verify that X_n/\mathbb{E}X_n converges almost surely to one and that X_n, properly normalized, weakly converges to the standard normal law. These results complement previously known facts concerning the number of collisions in \beta(a,b)-coalescents with a\in(0,2) and b=1, and a>2 and b>0. The case a=2 is a kind of `border situation' which seems not to be amenable to approaches used for a\neq2.
