We propose an algorithm to estimate the common density s of a stationary process X_1,...,X_n. We suppose that the process is either \beta or \tau-mixing. We provide a model selection procedure based on a generalization of Mallows' C_p and we prove oracle inequalities for the selected estimator under a few prior assumptions on the collection of models and on the mixing coefficients. We prove that our estimator is adaptive over a class of Besov spaces, namely, we prove that it achieves the same rates of convergence as in the i.i.d framework.
