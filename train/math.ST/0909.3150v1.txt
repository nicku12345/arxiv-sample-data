In this paper we prove the asymptotic efficiency of the model selection procedure proposed by the authors in the first part. To this end we introduce the robust risk as the least upper bound of the quadratical risk over a broad class of observation distributions. Asymptotic upper and lower bounds for the robust risk have been derived. The asymptotic efficiency of the procedure is proved. The Pinsker constant is found.
