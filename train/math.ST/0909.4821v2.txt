For statistical analysis of multiway contingency tables we propose modeling interaction terms in each maximal compact component of a hierarchical model. By this approach we can search for parsimonious models with smaller degrees of freedom than the usual hierarchical model, while preserving conditional independence structures in the hierarchical model. We discuss estimation and exacts tests of the proposed model and illustrate the advantage of the proposed modeling with some data sets.
