We consider an unknown response function f defined on \Delta=[0,1]^d, 1\le d\le\infty, taken at n random uniform design points and observed with Gaussian noise of known variance. Given a positive sequence r_n\to 0 as n\to\infty and a known function f_0 \in L_2(\Delta), we propose, under general conditions, a unified framework for the goodness-of-fit testing problem for testing the null hypothesis H_0: f=f_0 against the alternative H_1: f\in\CF, \|f-f_0\|\ge r_n, where \CF is an ellipsoid in the Hilbert space  L_2(\Delta) with respect to the tensor product Fourier basis and \|\cdot\| is the norm in  L_2(\Delta). We obtain both rate and sharp asymptotics for the error probabilities in the minimax setup. The derived tests are inherently non-adaptive.   Several illustrative examples are presented. In particular, we consider functions belonging to ellipsoids arising from the well-known multidimensional Sobolev and tensor product Sobolev norms as well as from the less-known Sloan-Wo\rm\acute{z}niakowski norm and a norm constructed from multivariable analytic functions on the complex strip.   Some extensions of the suggested minimax goodness-of-fit testing methodology, covering the cases of general design schemes with a known product probability density function, unknown variance, other basis functions and adaptivity of the suggested tests, are also briefly discussed.
