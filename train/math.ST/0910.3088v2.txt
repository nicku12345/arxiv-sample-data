In this paper, we show how concentration inequalities for Gaussian quadratic form can be used to propose exact confidence intervals of the Hurst index parametrizing a fractional Brownian motion. Both cases where the scaling parameter of the fractional Brownian motion is known or unknown are investigated. These intervals are obtained by observing a single discretized sample path of a fractional Brownian motion and without any assumption on the parameter H.
