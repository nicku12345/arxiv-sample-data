This paper addresses asymptotic properties of general penalized spline estimators with an arbitrary B-spline degree and an arbitrary order difference penalty. The estimator is approximated by a solution of a linear differential equation subject to suitable boundary conditions. It is shown that, in certain sense, the penalized smoothing corresponds approximately to smoothing by the kernel method. The equivalent kernels for both inner points and boundary points are obtained with the help of Green's functions of the differential equation. Further, the asymptotic normality is established for the estimator at interior points. It is shown that the convergence rate is independent of the degree of the splines, and the number of knots does not affect the asymptotic distribution, provided that it tends to infinity fast enough.
