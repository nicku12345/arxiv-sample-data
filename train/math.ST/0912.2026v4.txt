In this paper, we study the problem of adaptive estimation of the spectral density of a stationary Gaussian process. For this purpose, we consider a wavelet-based method which combines the ideas of wavelet approximation and estimation by information projection in order to warrants that the solution is a nonnegative function. The spectral density of the process is estimated by projecting the wavelet thresholding expansion of the periodogram onto a family of exponential functions. This ensures that the spectral density estimator is a strictly positive function. Then, by Bochner's theorem, the corresponding estimator of the covariance function is semidefinite positive. The theoretical behavior of the estimator is established in terms of rate of convergence of the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy over Besov classes. We also show the excellent practical performance of the estimator in some numerical experiments.
