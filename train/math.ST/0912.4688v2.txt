Let (X_i)_{i\geq 1} be a stationary mean-zero Gaussian process with covariances \rho(k)=\PE(X_{1}X_{k+1}) satisfying: \rho(0)=1 and \rho(k)=k^{-D} L(k) where D is in (0,1) and L is slowly varying at infinity. Consider the U-process \{U_n(r),\; r\in I\} defined as  U_n(r)=\frac{1}{n(n-1)}\sum_{1\leq i\neq j\leq n}\1_{\{G(X_i,X_j)\leq r\}}\; ,  where I is an interval included in \rset and G is a symmetric function. In this paper, we provide central and non-central limit theorems for U_n. They are used to derive the asymptotic behavior of the Hodges-Lehmann estimator, the Wilcoxon-signed rank statistic, the sample correlation integral and an associated scale estimator. The limiting distributions are expressed through multiple Wiener-It\^o integrals.
