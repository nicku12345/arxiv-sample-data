Let \{Z_n\} be a real nonstationary stochastic process such that E(Z_n|{\mathcaligr F}_{n-1})\stackrel{\mathrm{a.s.}}{<}\infty and E(Z^2_n|{\mathcaligr F}_{n-1})\stackrel{\mathrm{a.s.}}{<}\infty, where \{{\mathcaligr F}_n\} is an increasing sequence of \sigma-algebras. Assuming that E(Z_n|{\mathcaligr F}_{n-1})=g_n(\theta_0,\nu_0)=g^{(1)}_n(\theta_0)+g^{(2)}_n(\theta_0,\nu_0), \theta_0\in{\mathbb{R}}^p, p<\infty, \nu_0\in{\mathbb{R}}^q and q\leq\infty, we study the asymptotic properties of \hat{\theta}_n:=\arg\min_{\theta}\sum_{k=1}^n(Z_k-g_k({\theta,\hat{\nu}}))^2\lambda_k^{-1}, where \lambda_k is {\mathcaligr F}_{k-1}-measurable, \hat{\nu}=\{\hat{\nu}_k\} is a sequence of estimations of \nu_0, g_n(\theta,\hat{\nu}) is Lipschitz in \theta and g^{(2)}_n(\theta_0,\hat{\nu})-g^{(2)}_n(\theta,\hat{\nu}) is asymptotically negligible relative to g^{(1)}_n(\theta_0)-g^{(1)}_n(\theta). We first generalize to this nonlinear stochastic model the necessary and sufficient condition obtained for the strong consistency of \{\hat{\theta}_n\} in the linear model. For that, we prove a strong law of large numbers for a class of submartingales. Again using this strong law, we derive the general conditions leading to the asymptotic distribution of \hat{\theta}_n. We illustrate the theoretical results with examples of branching processes, and extension to quasi-likelihood estimators is also considered.
