We investigate the x\log x condition for a general (Crump--Mode--Jagers) multi-type branching process with a general type space by constructing a size-biased population measure that relates to the ordinary population measure via an intrinsic martingale W_t. Sufficiency of the x\log x condition for a non-degenerate limit of W_t is proved and conditions for necessity are investigated.
