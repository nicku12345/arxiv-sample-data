For a Markov chain \mathbf{X}=\{X_i,i=1,2,...,n\} with the state space \{0,1\}, the random variable S:=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i is said to follow a Markov binomial distribution. The exact distribution of S, denoted \mathcal{L}S, is very computationally intensive for large n (see Gabriel [Biometrika 46 (1959) 454--460] and Bhat and Lal [Adv. in Appl. Probab. 20 (1988) 677--680]) and this paper concerns suitable approximate distributions for \mathcal{L}S when \mathbf{X} is stationary. We conclude that the negative binomial and binomial distributions are appropriate approximations for \mathcal{L}S when \operatorname {Var}S is greater than and less than \mathbb{E}S, respectively. Also, due to the unique structure of the distribution, we are able to derive explicit error estimates for these approximations.
