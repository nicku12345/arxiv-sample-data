This paper deals with empirical processes of the type \[C_n(B)=\sqrt{n}\{\mu_n(B)-P(X_{n+1}\in B\mid X_1,...,X_n)\},\] where (X_n) is a sequence of random variables and \mu_n=(1/n)\sum_{i=1}^n\delta_{X_i} the empirical measure. Conditions for \sup_B|C_n(B)| to converge stably (in particular, in distribution) are given, where B ranges over a suitable class of measurable sets. These conditions apply when (X_n) is exchangeable or, more generally, conditionally identically distributed (in the sense of Berti et al. [Ann. Probab. 32 (2004) 2029--2052]). By such conditions, in some relevant situations, one obtains that \sup_B|C_n(B)|\stackrel{P}{\to}0 or even that \sqrt{n}\sup_B|C_n(B)| converges a.s. Results of this type are useful in Bayesian statistics.
