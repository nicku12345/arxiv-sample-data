In this paper, we are interested in the study of beta kernel estimators from an asymptotic minimax point of view. It is well known that beta kernel estimators are, on the contrary of classical kernel estimators, "free of boundary effect" and thus are very useful in practice. The goal of this paper is to prove that there is a price to pay: for very regular functions or for certain losses, these estimators are not minimax. Nevertheless they are minimax for classical regularities such as regularity of order two or less than two, supposed commonly in the practice and for some classical losses.
