In this paper, we present a statistical framework for modeling conditional quantiles of spatial processes assumed to be strongly mixing in space. We establish the L_1 consistency and the asymptotic normality of the kernel conditional quantile estimator in the case of random fields. We also define a nonparametric spatial predictor and illustrate the methodology used with some simulations.
