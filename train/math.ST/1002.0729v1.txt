In this work we introduce a new and richer class of finite order Markov chain models and address the following model selection problem: find the Markov model with the minimal set of parameters (minimal Markov model) which is necessary to represent a source as a Markov chain of finite order. Let us call M the order of the chain and A the finite alphabet, to determine the minimal Markov model, we define an equivalence relation on the state space A^{M}, such that all the sequences of size M with the same transition probabilities are put in the same category. In this way we have one set of (|A|-1) transition probabilities for each category, obtaining a model with a minimal number of parameters. We show that the model can be selected consistently using the Bayesian information criterion.
