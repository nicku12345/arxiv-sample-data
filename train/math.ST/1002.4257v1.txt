We consider a positive stationary generalized Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process \[V_t=\mathrm{e}^{-\xi_t}\biggl(\int_0^t\mathrm{e}^{\xi_{s-}}\ ,\mathrm{d}\eta_s+V_0\biggr)\qquadfor t\geq0,\] and the increments of the integrated generalized Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process I_k=\int_{k-1}^k\sqrt{V_{t-}} \mathrm{d}L_t, k\in\mathbb{N}, where (\xi_t,\eta_t,L_t)_{t\geq0} is a three-dimensional L\'{e}vy process independent of the starting random variable V_0. The genOU model is a continuous-time version of a stochastic recurrence equation. Hence, our models include, in particular, continuous-time versions of \operatorname {ARCH}(1) and \operatorname {GARCH}(1,1) processes. In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of extremes and the sample autocovariance function of (V_t)_{t\geq0} and (I_k)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}. Furthermore, we present a central limit result for (I_k)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}. Regular variation and point process convergence play a crucial role in establishing the statistics of (V_t)_{t\geq0} and (I_k)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}. The theory can be applied to the \operatorname {COGARCH}(1,1) and the Nelson diffusion model.
