Multivariate \operatorname {COGARCH}(1,1) processes are introduced as a continuous-time models for multidimensional heteroskedastic observations. Our model is driven by a single multivariate L\'{e}vy process and the latent time-varying covariance matrix is directly specified as a stochastic process in the positive semidefinite matrices. After defining the \operatorname {COGARCH}(1,1) process, we analyze its probabilistic properties. We show a sufficient condition for the existence of a stationary distribution for the stochastic covariance matrix process and present criteria ensuring the finiteness of moments. Under certain natural assumptions on the moments of the driving L\'{e}vy process, explicit expressions for the first and second-order moments and (asymptotic) second-order stationarity of the covariance matrix process are obtained. Furthermore, we study the stationarity and second-order structure of the increments of the multivariate \operatorname {COGARCH}(1,1) process and their "squares".
