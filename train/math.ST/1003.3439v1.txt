This work sets the non isotropic noncentral elliptical shape distributions via QR decomposition in the context of zonal polynomials, avoiding the invariant polynomials and the open problems for their computation. The new shape distributions are easily computable and then the inference procedure can be studied under exact densities instead under the published approximations and asymptotic densities under isotropic models. An application in Biology is studied under the classical gaussian approach and a two non gaussian models.
