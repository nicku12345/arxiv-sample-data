This work finds the non isotropic noncentral elliptical shape distributions via SVD decomposition in the context of zonal polynomials, avoiding the invariant polynomials and the open problems for their computation. The new shape distributions are easily computable and then the inference procedure is based on exact densities instead of the published approximations and asymptotic densities of isotropic models. An application of the technique is illustrated with a classical landmark data in Biology, for this, three models are proposed, the usual Gaussian and two non Gaussian; the best one is chosen by using a modified BIC criterion.
