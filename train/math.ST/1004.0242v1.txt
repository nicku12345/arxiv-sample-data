The non isotropic and non central elliptical shape distributions via the Le and Kendall SVD decomposition approach are derived in this paper in the context of invariant polynomials and zonal polynomials. The so termed cone and disk densities here obtained generalise some results of the literature. Finally, some particular densities are applied in a classical data of Biology, and the inference is performed after choosing the best model by using a modified BIC criterion.
