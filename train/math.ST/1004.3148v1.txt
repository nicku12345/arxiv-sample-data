If the space \mathcal{Q} of quadratic forms in \mathbb{R}^n is splitted in a direct sum \mathcal{Q}_1\oplus...\oplus \mathcal{Q}_k and if X and Y are independent random variables of \mathbb{R}^n, assume that there exist a real number a such that E(X|X+Y)=a(X+Y) and real distinct numbers b_1,...,b_k such that E(q(X)|X+Y)=b_iq(X+Y) for any q in \mathcal{Q}_i. We prove that this happens only when k=2, when \mathbb{R}^n can be structured in a Euclidean Jordan algebra and when X and Y have Wishart distributions corresponding to this structure.
