We derive a Markov basis consisting of moves of degree at most three for two-state toric homogeneous Markov chain model of arbitrary length without parameters for initial states. Our basis consists of moves of degree three and degree one, which alter the initial frequencies, in addition to moves of degree two and degree one for toric homogeneous Markov chain model with parameters for initial states.
