It is shown that the variable bandwidth density estimator proposed by McKay (1993a and b) following earlier findings by Abramson (1982) approximates density functions in C^4(\mathbb R^d) at the minimax rate in the supremum norm over bounded sets where the preliminary density estimates on which they are based are bounded away from zero. A somewhat more complicated estimator proposed by Jones McKay and Hu (1994) to approximate densities in C^6(\mathbb R) is also shown to attain minimax rates in sup norm over the same kind of sets. These estimators are strict probability densities.
