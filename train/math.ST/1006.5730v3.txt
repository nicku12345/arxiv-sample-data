The asymptotic properties of the variances of the spatial autoregressive model X_{k,\ell}=\alpha X_{k-1,\ell}+\beta X_{k,\ell-1}+\gamma X_{k-1,\ell-1}+\epsilon_{k,\ell} are investigated in the unit root case, that is when the parameters are on the boundary of domain of stability that forms a tetrahedron in [-1,1]^3. The limit of the variance of n^{-\varrho}X_{[ns],[nt]} is determined, where on the interior of the faces of the domain of stability \varrho=1/4, on the edges \varrho =1/2, while on the vertices \varrho =1.
