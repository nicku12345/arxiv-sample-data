We study the convergence of the false discovery proportion (FDP) of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure in the Gaussian equi-correlated model, when the correlation \rho_m converges to zero as the hypothesis number m grows to infinity. By contrast with the standard convergence rate m^{1/2} holding under independence, this study shows that the FDP converges to the false discovery rate (FDR) at rate \{\min(m,1/\rho_m)\}^{1/2} in this equi-correlated model.
