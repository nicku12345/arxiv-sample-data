In this paper, four new Chi-Square type statistics are presented for testing the hypothesis of a uniform null versus specified trend alternatives. The powers of these test statistics are compared with the powers of the statistics considered by Steele and Chaseling [8]. The four test statistics are shown to have superior or equivalent powers to the powers of the test statistics considered by the authors for certain trend alternatives and for certain conditions placed on the cell count.
