Prior distributions elicited for modelling the natural fluctuations or the uncertainty on parameters of Bayesian fishery population models, can be chosen among a vast range of statistical laws. Since the statistical framework is defined by observational processes, observational parameters enter into the estimation and must be considered random, similarly to parameters or states of interest like population levels or real catches. The former are thus perceived as nuisance parameters whose values are intrinsically linked to the considered experiment, which also require noninformative priors. In fishery research Jeffreys methodology has been presented by Millar (2002) as a practical way to elicit such priors. However they can present wrong properties in multiparameter contexts. Therefore we suggest to use the elicitation method proposed by Berger and Bernardo to avoid paradoxical results raised by Jeffreys priors. These benchmark priors are derived here in the framework of sequential population analysis.
