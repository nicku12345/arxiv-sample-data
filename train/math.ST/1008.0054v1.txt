This paper is devoted to the off-line multiple change-point detection in a semiparametric framework. The time series is supposed to belong to a large class of models including AR(\infty), ARCH(\infty), TARCH(\infty),... models where the coefficients change at each instant of breaks. The different unknown parameters (number of changes, change dates and parameters of successive models) are estimated using a penalized contrast built on conditional quasi-likelihood. Under Lipshitzian conditions on the model, the consistency of the estimator is proved when the moment order r of the process satisfies r\geq 2. If r\geq 4, the same convergence rates for the estimators than in the case of independent random variables are obtained. The particular cases of AR(\infty), ARCH(\infty) and TARCH(\infty) show that our method notably improves the existing results.
