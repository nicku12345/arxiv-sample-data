Under a partially linear models we study a family of robust estimates for the regression parameter and the regression function when some of the predictor variables take values on a Riemannian manifold. We obtain the consistency and the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. Also, we consider a robust cross validation procedure to select the smoothing parameter. Simulations and application to real data show the performance of our proposal under small samples and contamination.
