The non isotropic noncentral elliptical shape distributions via pseudo-Wishart distribution are founded. This way, the classical shape theory is extended to non isotropic case and the normality assumption is replaced by assuming a elliptical distribution. In several cases, the new shape distributions are easily computable and then the inference procedure can be studied under exact densities. An application in Biology is studied under the classical gaussian approach and two non gaussian models.
