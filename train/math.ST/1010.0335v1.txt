This paper presents some limit theorems for certain functionals of moving averages of semimartingales plus noise which are observed at high frequency. Our method generalizes the pre-averaging approach (see [Bernoulli 15 (2009) 634--658, Stochastic Process. Appl. 119 (2009) 2249--2276]) and provides consistent estimates for various characteristics of general semimartingales. Furthermore, we prove the associated multidimensional (stable) central limit theorems. As expected, we find central limit theorems with a convergence rate n^{-1/4}, if n is the number of observations.
