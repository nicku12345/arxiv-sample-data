Let X_1,X_2,...,X_n be a sequence of independent or locally dependent random variables taking values in \mathbb{Z}_+. In this paper, we derive sharp bounds, via a new probabilistic method, for the total variation distance between the distribution of the sum \sum_{i=1}^nX_i and an appropriate Poisson or compound Poisson distribution. These bounds include a factor which depends on the smoothness of the approximating Poisson or compound Poisson distribution. This "smoothness factor" is of order \mathrm{O}(\sigma ^{-2}), according to a heuristic argument, where \sigma ^2 denotes the variance of the approximating distribution. In this way, we offer sharp error estimates for a large range of values of the parameters. Finally, specific examples concerning appearances of rare runs in sequences of Bernoulli trials are presented by way of illustration.
