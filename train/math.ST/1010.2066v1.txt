In this work, we deal with approximations for distribution functions of non-negative random variables. More specifically, we construct continuous approximants using an acceleration technique over a well-know inversion formula for Laplace transforms. We give uniform error bounds using a representation of these approximations in terms of gamma-type operators. We apply our results to certain mixtures of Erlang distributions which contain the class of continuous phase-type distributions.
