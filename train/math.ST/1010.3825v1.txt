In this paper, we investigate the (in)-consistency of different bootstrap methods for constructing confidence intervals in the class of estimators that converge at rate n^{1/3}. The Grenander estimator, the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of an unknown nonincreasing density function f on [0,\infty), is a prototypical example. We focus on this example and explore different approaches to constructing bootstrap confidence intervals for f(t_0), where t_0\in(0,\infty) is an interior point. We find that the bootstrap estimate, when generating bootstrap samples from the empirical distribution function \mathbb{F}_n or its least concave majorant \tilde{F}_n, does not have any weak limit in probability. We provide a set of sufficient conditions for the consistency of any bootstrap method in this example and show that bootstrapping from a smoothed version of \tilde{F}_n leads to strongly consistent estimators. The m out of n bootstrap method is also shown to be consistent while generating samples from \mathbb{F}_n and \tilde{F}_n.
