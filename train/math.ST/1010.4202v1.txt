In this paper we consider a novel statistical inverse problem on the Poincar\'{e}, or Lobachevsky, upper (complex) half plane. Here the Riemannian structure is hyperbolic and a transitive group action comes from the space of 2\times2 real matrices of determinant one via M\"{o}bius transformations. Our approach is based on a deconvolution technique which relies on the Helgason--Fourier calculus adapted to this hyperbolic space. This gives a minimax nonparametric density estimator of a hyperbolic density that is corrupted by a random M\"{o}bius transform. A motivation for this work comes from the reconstruction of impedances of capacitors where the above scenario on the Poincar\'{e} plane exactly describes the physical system that is of statistical interest.
