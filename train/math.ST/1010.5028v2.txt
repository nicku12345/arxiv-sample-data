Consider a linear model Y=X\beta+z, z\sim N(0,I_n). Here, X=X_{n,p}, where both p and n are large, but p>n. We model the rows of X as i.i.d. samples from N(0,\frac{1}{n}\Omega), where \Omega is a p\times p correlation matrix, which is unknown to us but is presumably sparse. The vector \beta is also unknown but has relatively few nonzero coordinates, and we are interested in identifying these nonzeros. We propose the Univariate Penalization Screeing (UPS) for variable selection. This is a screen and clean method where we screen with univariate thresholding and clean with penalized MLE. It has two important properties: sure screening and separable after screening. These properties enable us to reduce the original regression problem to many small-size regression problems that can be fitted separately. The UPS is effective both in theory and in computation.
