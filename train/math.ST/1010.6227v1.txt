This work is motivated by a real work problem: objectivization. It consists in explaining the subjective drivability using physical criteria coming from signals measured during experiments. We suggest an approach for the discriminant variables selection trying to take advantage of the functional nature of the data. The porblem is ill-posed, since the number of explanatory variables is hugely greater than the sample size. The strategy proceeds in three steps: a signal preprocessing including wavelet denoising and synchronization, dimensionality reduction by compression using a common wavelet basis, and finally the selection of useful variables using a stepwise strategy involving successive applications of the CART method.
