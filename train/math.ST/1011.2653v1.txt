We investigate structure for pairs of randomizations that do not follow each other in a chain. These are unrandomized-inclusive, independent, coincident or double randomizations. This involves taking several structures that satisfy particular relations and combining them to form the appropriate orthogonal decomposition of the data space for the experiment. We show how to establish the decomposition table giving the sources of variation, their relationships and their degrees of freedom, so that competing designs can be evaluated. This leads to recommendations for when the different types of multiple randomization should be used.
