This habilitation thesis presents several contributions to (1) the PAC-Bayesian analysis of statistical learning, (2) the three aggregation problems: given d functions, how to predict as well as (i) the best of these d functions (model selection type aggregation), (ii) the best convex combination of these d functions, (iii) the best linear combination of these d functions, (3) the multi-armed bandit problems.
