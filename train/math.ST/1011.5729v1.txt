Using Bernstein polynomial approximations, we prove the central limit theorem for linear spectral statistics of sample covariance matrices, indexed by a set of functions with continuous fourth order derivatives on an open interval including [(1-\sqrt{y})^2,(1+\sqrt{y})^2], the support of the Mar\u{c}enko--Pastur law. We also derive the explicit expressions for asymptotic mean and covariance functions.
