Compound Poisson distributions and signed compound Poisson measures are used for approximation of the Markov binomial distribution. The upper and lower bound estimates are obtained for the total variation, local and Wasserstein norms. In a special case, asymptotically sharp constants are calculated. For the upper bounds, the smoothing properties of compound Poisson distributions are applied. For the lower bound estimates, the characteristic function method is used.
