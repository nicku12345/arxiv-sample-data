Limits of densities belonging to an exponential family appear in many applications, {e.g.} Gibbs models in Statistical Physics, relaxed combinatorial optimization, coding theory, critical likelihood computations, Bayes priors with singular support, random generation of factorial designs. We discuss the problem from the methodological point of view in the case of a finite state space. We prove two characterizations of the limit distributions, both based on a suitable description of the marginal polytope (convex hull of canonical statistics' values). First, the set of limit densities is equal to the set of conditional densities given a face of the marginal polytope. Second, in the lattice case there exists a parametric presentation, in monomial form, of the closure of the statistical model.
