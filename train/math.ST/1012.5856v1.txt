This work sets the statistical affine shape theory in the context of real normed division algebras. The general densities apply for every field: real, complex, quaternion, octonion, and for any noncentral and non-isotropic elliptical distribution; then the separated published works about real and complex shape distributions can be obtained as corollaries by a suitable selection of the field parameter and univariate integrals involving the generator elliptical function. As a particular case, the complex normal affine density is derived and applied in brain magnetic resonance scans of normal and schizophrenic patients.
