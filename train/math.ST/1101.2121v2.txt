In this paper we consider a semiparametric regression model involving a d-dimensional quantitative explanatory variable X and including a dimension reduction of X via an index \beta'X. In this model, the main goal is to estimate the euclidean parameter \beta and to predict the real response variable Y conditionally to X. Our approach is based on sliced inverse regression (SIR) method and optimal quantization in \mathbf{L}^p-norm. We obtain the convergence of the proposed estimators of \beta and of the conditional distribution. Simulation studies show the good numerical behavior of the proposed estimators for finite sample size.
