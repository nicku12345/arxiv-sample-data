The 'standard' confidence interval for a Poisson parameter is only one of a number of estimation intervals based on the chi-square distribution that may be used in the estimation of the mean or mean rate for a Poisson model. Other chi-square intervals are available for experimenters using Bayesian or structural inference methods. Exploring these intervals also leads to other alternate approximate chi-square intervals. Although coverage probability may not always be of interest for Bayesian or structural intervals, coverage probabilities are useful for validating 'objective' priors. Coverage probabilities are explored for all of the intervals considered.
