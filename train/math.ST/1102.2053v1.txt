There exist very few results on mixing for non-stationary processes. However, mixing is often required in statistical inference for non-stationary processes such as time-varying ARCH (tvARCH) models. In this paper, bounds for the mixing rates of a stochastic process are derived in terms of the conditional densities of the process. These bounds are used to obtain the \alpha, 2-mixing and \beta-mixing rates of the non-stationary time-varying \operatorname {ARCH}(p) process and \operatorname {ARCH}(\infty) process. It is shown that the mixing rate of the time-varying \operatorname {ARCH}(p) process is geometric, whereas the bound on the mixing rate of the \operatorname {ARCH}(\infty) process depends on the rate of decay of the \operatorname {ARCH}(\infty) parameters. We note that the methodology given in this paper is applicable to other processes.
