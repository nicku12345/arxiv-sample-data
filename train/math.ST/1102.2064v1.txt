The aim of this article is to establish asymptotic distributions and consistency of subsampling for spectral density and for magnitude of coherence for non-stationary, almost periodically correlated time series. We show the asymptotic normality of the spectral density estimator and the limiting distribution of a magnitude of coherence statistic for all points from the bifrequency square. The theoretical results hold under \alpha-mixing and moment conditions.
