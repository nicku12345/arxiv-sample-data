Let X_1,...,X_n be a random sample from some unknown probability density f defined on a compact homogeneous manifold \mathbf M of dimension d \ge 1. Consider a 'needlet frame' \{\phi_{j \eta}\} describing a localised projection onto the space of eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator on \mathbf M with corresponding eigenvalues less than 2^{2j}, as constructed in \cite{GP10}. We prove non-asymptotic concentration inequalities for the uniform deviations of the linear needlet density estimator f_n(j) obtained from an empirical estimate of the needlet projection \sum_\eta \phi_{j \eta} \int f \phi_{j \eta} of f. We apply these results to construct risk-adaptive estimators and nonasymptotic confidence bands for the unknown density f. The confidence bands are adaptive over classes of differentiable and H\"{older}-continuous functions on \mathbf M that attain their H\"{o}lder exponents.
