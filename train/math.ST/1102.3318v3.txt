Spatial unilateral autoregressive model X_{k,\ell}=\alpha X_{k-1,\ell}+\beta X_{k,\ell-1}+\gamma X_{k-1,\ell-1}+\epsilon_{k,\ell} is investigated in the unit root case, that is when the parameters are on the boundary of the domain of stability that forms a tetrahedron with vertices (1,1,-1), \ (1,-1,1),\ (-1,1,1) and (-1,-1,-1). It is shown that the limiting distribution of the least squares estimator of the parameters is normal and the rate of convergence is n when the parameters are in the faces or on the edges of the tetrahedron, while on the vertices the rate is n^{3/2}.
