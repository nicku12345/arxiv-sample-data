Gaussian covariance graph models encode marginal independence among the components of a multivariate random vector by means of a graph G. These models are distinctly different from the traditional concentration graph models (often also referred to as Gaussian graphical models or covariance selection models) since the zeros in the parameter are now reflected in the covariance matrix \Sigma, as compared to the concentration matrix \Omega =\Sigma^{-1}. The parameter space of interest for covariance graph models is the cone P_G of positive definite matrices with fixed zeros corresponding to the missing edges of G. As in Letac and Massam [Ann. Statist. 35 (2007) 1278--1323], we consider the case where G is decomposable. In this paper, we construct on the cone P_G a family of Wishart distributions which serve a similar purpose in the covariance graph setting as those constructed by Letac and Massam [Ann. Statist. 35 (2007) 1278--1323] and Dawid and Lauritzen [Ann. Statist. 21 (1993) 1272--1317] do in the concentration graph setting. We proceed to undertake a rigorous study of these "covariance" Wishart distributions and derive several deep and useful properties of this class.
