This paper develops a framework for the estimation of the functional mean and the functional principal components when the functions form a random field. More specifically, the data we study consist of curves X(\mathbf{s}_k;t),t\in[0,T], observed at spatial points \mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{s}_N. We establish conditions for the sample average (in space) of the X(\mathbf{s}_k) to be a consistent estimator of the population mean function, and for the usual empirical covariance operator to be a consistent estimator of the population covariance operator. These conditions involve an interplay of the assumptions on an appropriately defined dependence between the functions X(\mathbf{s}_k) and the assumptions on the spatial distribution of the points \mathbf{s}_k. The rates of convergence may be the same as for i.i.d. functional samples, but generally depend on the strength of dependence and appropriately quantified distances between the points \mathbf{s}_k. We also formulate conditions for the lack of consistency.
