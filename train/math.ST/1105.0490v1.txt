A number of regularization methods for discrete inverse problems consist in considering weighted versions of the usual least square solution. However, these so-called filter methods are generally restricted to monotonic transformations, e.g. the Tikhonov regularization or the spectral cut-off. In this paper, we point out that in several cases, non-monotonic sequences of filters are more efficient. We study a regularization method that naturally extends the spectral cut-off procedure to non-monotonic sequences and provide several oracle inequalities, showing the method to be nearly optimal under mild assumptions. Then, we extend the method to inverse problems with noisy operator and provide efficiency results in a newly introduced conditional framework.
