Consider an autoregressive model with measurement error: we observe Z_i=X_i+\epsilon_i, where X_i is a stationary solution of the equation X_i=f_{\theta^0}(X_{i-1})+\xi_i. The regression function f_{\theta^0} is known up to a finite dimensional parameter \theta^0. The distributions of X_0 and \xi_1 are unknown whereas the distribution of \epsilon_1 is completely known. We want to estimate the parameter \theta^0 by using the observations Z_0,..,Z_n. We propose an estimation procedure based on a modified least square criterion involving a weight function w, to be suitably chosen. We give upper bounds for the risk of the estimator, which depend on the smoothness of the errors density f_\epsilon and on the smoothness properties of w f_\theta.
