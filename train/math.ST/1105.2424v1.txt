In this paper, we study nonparametric estimation of the L\'{e}vy density for L\'{e}vy processes, with and without Brownian component. For this, we consider n discrete time observations with step \Delta. The asymptotic framework is: n tends to infinity, \Delta=\Delta_n tends to zero while n\Delta_n tends to infinity. We use a Fourier approach to construct an adaptive nonparametric estimator of the L\'{e}vy density and to provide a bound for the global {\mathbb{L}}^2-risk. Estimators of the drift and of the variance of the Gaussian component are also studied. We discuss rates of convergence and give examples and simulation results for processes fitting in our framework.
