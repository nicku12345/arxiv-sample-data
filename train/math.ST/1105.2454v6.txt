This article considers inference in linear models with d\_X regressors, some or many of which could be endogenous, and d\_Z instrumental variables (IVs). d\_Z can range from less than d\_X to any order smaller than an exponential in the sample size. For moderate d\_X, identification robust confidence sets are obtained by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite programs. For large d\_X, we propose the STIV estimator. The analysis of its error uses sensitivity characteristics introduced in this paper. Robust confidence sets are derived by solving linear programs. Results on rates of convergence, variable selection, and confidence sets which "adapt" to the sparsity are given. Generalizations include models with endogenous IVs and systems of equations with approximation errors. We also analyse confidence bands for vectors of linear functionals and functions using bias correction. The application is to a demand system with approximation errors, cross-equation restrictions, and thousands of endogenous regressors.
