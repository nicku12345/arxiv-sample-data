In the random coefficients binary choice model, a binary variable equals 1 iff an index X^\top\beta is positive.The vectors X and \beta are independent and belong to the sphere \mathbb{S}^{d-1} in \mathbb{R}^{d}.We prove lower bounds on the minimax risk for estimation of the density f\_{\beta} over Besov bodies where the loss is a power of the L^p(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}) norm for 1\le p\le \infty. We show that a hard thresholding estimator based on a needlet expansion with data-driven thresholds achieves these lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.
