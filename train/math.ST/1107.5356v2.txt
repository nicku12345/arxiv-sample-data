The Dvoretzky--Kiefer--Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality says that if F_n is an empirical distribution function for variables i.i.d.\ with a distribution function F, and K_n is the Kolmogorov statistic \sqrt{n}\sup_x|(F_n-F)(x)|, then there is a finite constant C such that for any M>0, \Pr(K_n>M) \leq C\exp(-2M^2). Massart proved that one can take C=2 (DKWM inequality) which is sharp for F continuous. We consider the analogous Kolmogorov--Smirnov statistic KS_{m,n} for the two-sample case and show that for m=n, the DKW inequality holds with C=2 if and only if n\geq 458. For n_0\leq n<458 it holds for some C>2 depending on n_0.   For m\neq n, the DKWM inequality fails for the three pairs (m,n) with 1\leq m < n\leq 3. We found by computer search that for n\geq 4, the DKWM inequality always holds for 1\leq m< n\leq 200, and further that it holds for n=2m with 101\leq m\leq 300. We conjecture that the DKWM inequality holds for pairs m\leq n with the 457+3 =460 exceptions mentioned.
