Let \bm X=(X_1,...,X_d) be a random vector, whose components are not necessarily independent nor are they required to have identical distribution functions F_1,...,F_d. Denote by N_s the number of exceedances among X_1,...,X_d above a high threshold s. The fragility index, defined by FI=\lim_{s\nearrow}E(N_s\mid N_s>0) if this limit exists, measures the asymptotic stability of the stochastic system \bm X as the threshold increases. The system is called stable if FI=1 and fragile otherwise. In this paper we show that the asymptotic conditional distribution of exceedance counts (ACDEC) p_k=\lim_{s\nearrow}P(N_s=k\mid N_s>0), 1\le k\le d, exists, if the copula of \bm X is in the domain of attraction of a multivariate extreme value distribution, and if \lim_{s\nearrow}(1-F_i(s))/(1-F_\kappa(s))=\gamma_i\in[0,\infty) exists for 1\le i\le d and some \kappa\in{1,...,d}. This enables the computation of the FI corresponding to \bm X and of the extended FI as well as of the asymptotic distribution of the exceedance cluster length also in that case, where the components of \bm X are not identically distributed.
