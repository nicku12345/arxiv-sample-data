The objective of this paper is to provide, for the problem of univariate symmetry (with respect to specified or unspecified location), a concept of optimality, and to construct tests achieving such optimality. This requires embedding symmetry into adequate families of asymmetric (local) alternatives. We construct such families by considering non-Gaussian generalizations of classical first-order Edgeworth expansions indexed by a measure of skewness such that (i) location, scale and skewness play well-separated roles (diagonality of the corresponding information matrices) and (ii) the classical tests based on the Pearson--Fisher coefficient of skewness are optimal in the vicinity of Gaussian densities.
