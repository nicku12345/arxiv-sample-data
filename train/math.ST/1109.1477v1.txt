Let (X,Y) be a random vector with distribution function F(x,y), and (X_{1},Y_{1}),(X_{2},Y_{2}),...,(X_{n},Y_{n}) are independent copies of (X,Y). Let X_{i:n} be the ith order statistics constructed from the sample X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n} of the first coordinate of the bivariate sample and Y_{[i:n]} be the concomitant of X_{i:n}. Denote F_{i:n}% (x,y)=P\{X_{i:n}\leq x,Y_{[i:n]}\leq y\}. Using majorization theory we write upper and lower bounds for F expressed in terms of mixtures of joint distributions of order statistics and their concomitants, i.e. {\dsum \limits_{i=1}^{n}}% {\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}} p_{i}F_{i:n}(x,y) and {\dsum \limits_{i=1}^{n}}% {\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}} p_{i}F_{n-i+1:n}(x,y). It is shown that these bounds converge to F for a particular sequence (p_{1}(m),p_{2}(m),...,p_{n}(m)),m=1,2,.. as m\rightarrow\infty.
