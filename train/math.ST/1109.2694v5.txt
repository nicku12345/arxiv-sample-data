In this paper, under natural and easily verifiable conditions, we prove the \mathbb{L}^1-convergence and the asymptotic normality of the Parzen-Rosenblatt density estimator for stationary random fields of the form X_k = g\left(\varepsilon_{k-s}, s \in \Z^d \right), k\in\Z^d, where (\varepsilon_i)_{i\in\Z^d} are i.i.d real random variables and g is a measurable function defined on \R^{\Z^d}. Such kind of processes provides a general framework for stationary ergodic random fields. A Berry-Esseen's type central limit theorem is also given for the considered estimator.
