We revisit and reinterpret Selten's concept of subgame perfectness in the context of single agent normal form sequential decision making, which leads us to the concept of subtree perfectness. Thereby, we extend Hammond's characterization of extensive form consequentialist consistent behaviour norms to the normal form and to arbitrary choice functions under very few assumptions. In particular, we do not need to assume probabilities on any event or utilities on any reward. We show that subtree perfectness is equivalent to normal-extensive form equivalence, and is sufficient, but, perhaps surprisingly, not necessary, for backward induction to work.
