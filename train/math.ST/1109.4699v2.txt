In this paper we consider two statistical hypotheses for the families of Wishart type distributions. These distributions are analogs of the Wishart distributions defined and parametrized over a Lorentz cone. We test these hypotheses by means of maximal invariant statistics which are explicitly derived in the paper. The testing problems, respectively, concern the hypothesis that parameters are in a sub-Lorentz-cone, and the the hypothesis that two observations have the same parameter.
