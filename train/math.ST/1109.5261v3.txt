Ferguson's Dirichlet process plays an important role in nonparametric Bayesian inference. Let P_a be the Dirichlet process in \mathbb{R} with a base probability measure H and a concentration parameter a>0. In this paper, we show that \sqrt {a} \big(P_a((-\infty,t]) -H((-\infty,t])\big) converges to a certain Brownian bridge as a \to \infty. We also derive a certain Glivenko-Cantelli theorem for the Dirichlet process. Using the functional delta method, the weak convergence of the quantile process is also obtained. A large concentration parameter occurs when a statistician puts too much emphasize on his/her prior guess. This scenario also happens when the sample size is large and the posterior is used to make inference.
