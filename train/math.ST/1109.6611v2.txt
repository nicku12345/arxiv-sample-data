We consider an empirical process based upon ratio of selected pair of the non-overlapping m-spacings generated by independent samples of arbitrary sizes. As a main result, we show that when both samples are uniformly distributed on intervals of equal lengths, this empirical process converges to a mean-centered Brownian bridge of the form \ \displaystyle (B\circ H_{m})_{C}(v)=B(H_{m}(v))-2(2m+1)C\ \frac{(2m-1)!}{m((m-1)!)^2}(v(1-v))^m\int_{0}^{1}B(H_{m}(s))\ud s,\  for \ \displaystyle 0\leq v\leq 1,\  where \ \displaystyle B(.)\  denotes a Brownian bridge, \ \displaystyle H_{m},\  the distribution function of the Beta distribution with parameters m and m,\  and C,\  a constant.
