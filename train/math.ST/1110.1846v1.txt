Consider the semiparametric transformation model \Lambda_{\theta_o}(Y)=m(X)+\epsilon, where \theta_o is an unknown finite dimensional parameter, the functions \Lambda_{\theta_o} and m are smooth, \epsilon is independent of X, and \esp(\epsilon)=0. We propose a kernel-type estimator of the density of the error \epsilon, and prove its asymptotic normality. The estimated errors, which lie at the basis of this estimator, are obtained from a profile likelihood estimator of \theta_o and a nonparametric kernel estimator of m. The practical performance of the proposed density estimator is evaluated in a simulation study.
