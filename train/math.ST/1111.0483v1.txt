This article studies exponential families \mathcal{E} on finite sets such that the information divergence D(P\|\mathcal{E}) of an arbitrary probability distribution from \mathcal{E} is bounded by some constant D>0. A particular class of low-dimensional exponential families that have low values of D can be obtained from partitions of the state space. The main results concern optimality properties of these partition exponential families. Exponential families where D=\log(2) are studied in detail. This case is special, because if D<\log(2), then \mathcal{E} contains all probability measures with full support.
