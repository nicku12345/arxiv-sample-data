A d-dimensional nonparametric additive regression model with dependent observations is considered. Using the marginal integration technique and wavelets methodology, we develop a new adaptive estimator for a component of the additive regression function. Its asymptotic properties are investigated via the minimax approach under the \mathbb{L}_2 risk over Besov balls. We prove that it attains a sharp rate of convergence which turns to be the one obtained in the \iid case for the standard univariate regression estimation problem.
