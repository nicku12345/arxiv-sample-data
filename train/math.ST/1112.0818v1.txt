One-step ahead prediction for the multinomial model is considered. The performance of a predictive density is evaluated by the average Kullback-Leibler divergence from the true density to the predictive density. Asymptotic approximations of risk functions of Bayesian predictive densities based on Dirichlet priors are obtained. It is shown that a Bayesian predictive density based on a specific Dirichlet prior is asymptotically minimax. The asymptotically minimax prior is different from known objective priors such as the Jeffreys prior or the uniform prior.
