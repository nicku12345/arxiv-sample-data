The higher criticism of a family of tests starts with the individual uncorrected p-values of each test. It then requires a procedure for deciding whether the collection of p-values indicates the presence of a real effect and if possible selects the ones that deserve closer scrutiny. This paper investigates procedures in which the ordered p-values are compared to an arbitrary positive and non-decreasing threshold sequence.
