A deformed logarithm function called q-logarithm has received considerable attention by physicist after its introduction by C. Tsallis. J. Naudts has proposed a generalization called \phi-logarithm and he has derived the basic properties of \phi-exponential families. In this paper we study the related notion of marginal polytope in the case of a finite state space.
