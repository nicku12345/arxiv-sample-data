We observe n inhomogeneous Poisson processes with covariates and aim at estimating their intensities. We assume that the intensity of each Poisson process is of the form s (\cdot, x) where x is the covariate and where s is an unknown function. We propose a model selection approach where the models are used to approximate the multivariate function s. We show that our estimator satisfies an oracle-type inequality under very weak assumptions both on the intensities and the models. By using an Hellinger-type loss, we establish non-asymptotic risk bounds and specify them under several kind of assumptions on the target function s such as being smooth or a product function. Besides, we show that our estimation procedure is robust with respect to these assumptions.
