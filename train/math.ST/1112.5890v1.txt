This paper focuses on recovering an unknown vector \beta from the noisy data Y=X\beta +\sigma\xi, where X is a known n\times p-matrix, \xi  is a standard white Gaussian noise, and \sigma is an unknown noise level. In order to estimate \beta, a spectral regularization method is used, and our goal is to choose its regularization parameter with the help of the data Y. In this paper, we deal solely with regularization methods based on the so-called ordered smoothers and provide some oracle inequalities in the case, where the noise level is unknown.
