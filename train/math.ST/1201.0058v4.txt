In this paper, we show the Wilks type of results for the Bradley-Terry model. Specifically, for some simple and composite null hypotheses of interest, we show that the likelihood ratio test statistic \Lambda enjoys a chi-square approximation in the sense that (2p)^{-1/2}(-2\log \Lambda -p)\stackrel{L}{\rightarrow}N(0,1) as p goes to infinity, where p is the corresponding degrees of freedom. Simulation studies and an application to NBA data illustrate the theoretical results.
