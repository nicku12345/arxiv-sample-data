We establish sufficient conditions for the asymptotic normality of kernel density estimators, applied to causal linear random fields. Our conditions on the coefficients of linear random fields are weaker than known results, although our assumption on the bandwidth is not minimal. The proof is based on the m-approximation method. As a key step, we prove a central limit theorem for triangular arrays of stationary m-dependent random fields with unbounded m. We also apply a moment inequality recently established for stationary random fields.
