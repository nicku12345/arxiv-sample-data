In this paper we study the asymptotic behaviour of power and multipower variations of processes Y:\[Y_t=\int_{-\in fty}^tg(t-s)\sigma_sW(\mathrm{d}s)+Z_t,\] where g:(0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathbb{R} is deterministic, \sigma >0 is a random process, W is the stochastic Wiener measure and Z is a stochastic process in the nature of a drift term. Processes of this type serve, in particular, to model data of velocity increments of a fluid in a turbulence regime with spot intermittency \sigma. The purpose of this paper is to determine the probabilistic limit behaviour of the (multi)power variations of Y as a basis for studying properties of the intermittency process \sigma. Notably the processes Y are in general not of the semimartingale kind and the established theory of multipower variation for semimartingales does not suffice for deriving the limit properties. As a key tool for the results, a general central limit theorem for triangular Gaussian schemes is formulated and proved. Examples and an application to the realised variance ratio are given.
