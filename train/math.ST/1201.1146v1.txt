The conventional definition of a depth function is vector-based. In this paper, a novel projection depth (PD) technique directly based on tensors, such as matrices, is instead proposed. Tensor projection depth (TPD) is still an ideal depth function and its computation can be achieved through the iteration of PD. Furthermore, we also discuss the cases for sparse samples and higher order tensors. Experimental results in data classification with the two projection depths show that TPD performs much better than PD for data with a natural tensor form, and even when the data have a natural vector form, TPD appears to perform no worse than PD.
