Given an i.i.d sample (Y_i,Z_i), taking values in \RRR^{d'}\times \RRR^d, we consider a collection Nadarya-Watson kernel estimators of the conditional expectations \EEE(<c_g(z),g(Y)>+d_g(z)\mid Z=z), where z belongs to a compact set H\subset \RRR^d, g a Borel function on \RRR^{d'} and c_g(\cdot),d_g(\cdot) are continuous functions on \RRR^d. Given two bandwidth sequences h_n<\wth_n fulfilling mild conditions, we obtain an exact and explicit almost sure limit bounds for the deviations of these estimators around their expectations, uniformly in g\in\GG,\;z\in H and h_n\le h\le \wth_n under mild conditions on the density f_Z, the class \GG, the kernel K and the functions c_g(\cdot),d_g(\cdot). We apply this result to prove that smoothed empirical likelihood can be used to build confidence intervals for conditional probabilities \PPP(Y\in C\mid Z=z), that hold uniformly in z\in H,\; C\in \CC,\; h\in [h_n,\wth_n]. Here \CC is a Vapnik-Chervonenkis class of sets.
