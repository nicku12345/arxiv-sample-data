Given an observation of the uniform empirical process \alp_n, its functional increments \alp_n(u+a_n\cdot)-\alp_n(u) can be viewed as a single random process, when u is distributed under the Lebesgue measure. We investigate the almost sure limit behaviour of the multivariate versions of these processes as \nif and a_n\downarrow 0. Under mild conditions on a_n, a convergence in distribution and functional limit laws are established. The proofs rely on a new extension of usual Poissonisation tools for the local empirical process.
