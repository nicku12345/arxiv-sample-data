Let (X_i)_{i\geq 1} be an i.i.d. sample on \RRR^d having density f. Given a real function \phi on \RRR^d with finite variation and given an integer valued sequence (j_n), let \fn denote the estimator of f by wavelet projection based on \phi and with multiresolution level equal to j_n. We provide exact rates of almost sure convergence to 0 of the quantity \sup_{x\in H}\mid \fn(x)-\EEE(\fn)(x)\mid, when n2^{-dj_n}/\log n \rar \infty and H is a given hypercube of \RRR^d. We then show that, if n2^{-dj_n}/\log n \rar c for a constant c>0, then the quantity \sup_{x\in H}\mid \fn(x)-f\mid almost surely fails to converge to 0.
