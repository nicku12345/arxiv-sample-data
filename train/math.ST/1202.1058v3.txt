For an n\times n balanced symmetric matrix T=(t_{i,j}) with positive elements satisfying t_{i,i}= \sum_{j\neq i} t_{i,j} and certain bounding conditions, we propose to use the matrix S=(s_{i,j}) to approximate its inverse, where s_{i,j}=\delta_{i,j}/t_{i,i}-1/t_{..}, \delta_{i,j} is the Kronecker delta function, and t_{..}=\sum_{i,j=1 }^{n}(1-\delta_{i,j}) t_{i,j}. An explicit bound on the approximation error is obtained, showing that the inverse is well approximated to order 1/(n-1)^2 uniformly.
