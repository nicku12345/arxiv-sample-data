This paper deals with the problem of estimating the level sets L(c)= \{F(x) \geq c \}, with c \in (0,1), of an unknown distribution function F on \mathbb{R}^d_+. A plug-in approach is followed. That is, given a consistent estimator F_n of F, we estimate L(c) by L_n(c)= \{F_n(x) \geq c \}. We state consistency results with respect to the Hausdorff distance and the volume of the symmetric difference. These results can be considered as generalizations of results previously obtained, in a bivariate framework, in Di Bernardino et al. (2011). Finally we investigate the effects of scaling data on our consistency results.
