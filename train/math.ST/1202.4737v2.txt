Recently the regular conditional distributions of max-infinitely divisible processes were derived by \citet{Dombry2011} and although these conditional distributions have complicated closed forms, \citet{Dombry2011b} introduce an algorithm to get conditional realizations of Brown-Resnick processes. In this paper we derive the regular conditional distributions of the max-stable process introduced by \citet{Schlather2002} and adapt the framework of \citet{Dombry2011b} to this specific process. We test the methods on simulated data and give an application to extreme temperatures in Switzerland. Results show that the proposed sampling scheme provide accurate conditional simulations and can handle real-sized problems.
