For a Gaussian time series with long-memory behavior, we use the FEXP-model for semi-parametric estimation of the long-memory parameter d. The true spectral density f_o is assumed to have long-memory parameter d_o and a FEXP-expansion of Sobolev-regularity \be > 1. We prove that when k follows a Poisson or geometric prior, or a sieve prior increasing at rate n^{\frac{1}{1+2\be}}, d converges to d_o at a suboptimal rate. When the sieve prior increases at rate n^{\frac{1}{2\be}} however, the minimax rate is almost obtained. Our results can be seen as a Bayesian equivalent of the result which Moulines and Soulier obtained for some frequentist estimators.
