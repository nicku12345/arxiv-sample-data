The current Special Issue of The Annals of Statistics contains three invited articles. Javier Rojo discusses Erich's scientific achievements and provides complete lists of his scientific writings and his former Ph.D. students. Willem van Zwet describes aspects of Erich's life and work, enriched with personal and interesting anecdotes of Erich's long and productive scientific journey. Finally, Peter Bickel, Aiyou Chen and Elizaveta Levina present a research paper on network models: they dedicate their contribution to Erich, emphasizing that their new nonparametric method and issues about optimality have been very much influenced by Erich's thinking.
