A hybrid censoring scheme is a mixture of Type-I and Type-II censoring schemes. We study the estimation of parameters of weighted exponential distribution based on Type-II hybrid censored data. By applying EM algorithm, maximum likelihood estimators are evaluated. Also using Fisher infirmation matrix asymptotic confidence intervals are provided. By applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques Bayes estimators, and corresponding highest posterior density confidence intervals of parameters are obtained. Monte Carlo simulations to compare the performances of the different methods is performed and one data set is analyzed for illustrative purposes.
