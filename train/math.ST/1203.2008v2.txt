We consider spherical data X_i noised by a random rotation \varepsilon_i\in SO(3) so that only the sample Z_i=\varepsilon_iX_i, i=1,\dots, N is observed. We define a nonparametric test procedure to distinguish H_0: ''the density f of X_i is the uniform density f_0 on the sphere'' and H_1: ''\|f-f_0\|_2^2\geq \C\psi_N and f is in a Sobolev space with smoothness s''. For a noise density f_\varepsilon with smoothness index \nu, we show that an adaptive procedure (i.e. s is not assumed to be known) cannot have a faster rate of separation than \psi_N^{ad}(s)=(N/\sqrt{\log\log(N)})^{-2s/(2s+2\nu+1)} and we provide a procedure which reaches this rate. We also deal with the case of super smooth noise. We illustrate the theory by implementing our test procedure for various kinds of noise on SO(3) and by comparing it to other procedures. Applications to real data in astrophysics and paleomagnetism are provided.
