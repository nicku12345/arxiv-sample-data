A new concept of (asymptotic) qualitative robustness for plug-in estimators based on identically distributed possibly dependent observations is introduced, and it is shown that Hampel's theorem for general metrics d still holds. Since Hampel's theorem assumes the UGC property w.r.t. d, that is, convergence in probability of the empirical probability measure to the true marginal distribution w.r.t. d uniformly in the class of all admissible laws on the sample path space, this property is shown for a large class of strongly mixing laws for three different metrics d. For real-valued observations, the UGC property is established for both the Kolomogorov \phi-metric and the L\'{e}vy \psi-metric, and for observations in a general locally compact and second countable Hausdorff space the UGC property is established for a certain metric generating the \psi-weak topology. The key is a new uniform weak LLN for strongly mixing random variables. The latter is of independent interest and relies on Rio's maximal inequality.
