We study the local linear estimator for the drift coefficient of stochastic differential equations driven by \alpha-stable L\'{e}vy motions observed at discrete instants letting T \rightarrow \infty. Under regular conditions, we derive the weak consistency and central limit theorem of the estimator. Compare with Nadaraya-Watson estimator, the local linear estimator has a bias reduction whether kernel function is symmetric or not under different schemes.
