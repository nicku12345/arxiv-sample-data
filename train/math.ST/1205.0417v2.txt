In this paper nonparametric methods to assess the multivariate L\'{e}vy measure are introduced. Starting from high-frequency observations of a L\'{e}vy process \mathbf{X}, we construct estimators for its tail integrals and the Pareto-L\'{e}vy copula and prove weak convergence of these estimators in certain function spaces. Given n observations of increments over intervals of length \Delta_n, the rate of convergence is k_n^{-1/2} for k_n=n\Delta_n which is natural concerning inference on the L\'{e}vy measure. Besides extensions to nonequidistant sampling schemes analytic properties of the Pareto-L\'{e}vy copula which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been mentioned before in the literature are provided as well. We conclude with a short simulation study on the performance of our estimators and apply them to real data.
