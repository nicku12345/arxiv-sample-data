We show that the thermal subadditivity of entropy provides a common basis to derive a strong form of the bounded difference inequality and related results as well as more recent inequalities applicable to convex Lipschitz functions, random symmetric matrices, shortest travelling salesmen paths and weakly self-bounding functions. We also give two new concentration inequalities.
