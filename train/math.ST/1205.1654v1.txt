Two transformations \mathcal{A}_1 and \mathcal{A}_2 of L\'{e}vy measures on \mathbb{R}^d based on the arcsine density are studied and their relation to general Upsilon transformations is considered. The domains of definition of \mathcal{A}_1 and \mathcal{A}_2 are determined and it is shown that they have the same range. The class of infinitely divisible distributions on \mathbb{R}^d with L\'{e}vy measures being in the common range is called the class A and any distribution in the class A is expressed as the law of a stochastic integral \int_0^1\cos(2^{-1}\uppi t)\,\mathrm{d}X_t with respect to a L\'{e}vy process \{X_t\}. This new class includes as a proper subclass the Jurek class of distributions. It is shown that generalized type G distributions are the image of distributions in the class A under a mapping defined by an appropriate stochastic integral. \mathcal{A}_2 is identified as an Upsilon transformation, while \mathcal{A}_1 is shown not to be.
