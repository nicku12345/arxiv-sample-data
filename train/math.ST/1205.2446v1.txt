In this paper, we consider the problem of treating linear regression equation coefficients in the case of correlated predictors. It is shown that in general there are no natural ways of interpreting these coefficients similar to the case of single predictor. Nevertheless we suggest linear transformations of predictors, reducing multiple regression to a simple one and retaining the coefficient at variable of interest. The new variable can be treated as the part of the old variable that has no linear statistical dependence on other presented variables.
