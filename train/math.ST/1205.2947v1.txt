Let \{X_n\}_{n\ge0} be a V-geometrically ergodic Markov chain. Given some real-valued functional F, define M_n(\alpha):=n^{-1}\sum_{k=1}^nF(\alpha,X_{k-1},X_k), \alpha\in\mathcal{A}\subset \mathbb {R}. Consider an M estimator \hat{\alpha}_n, that is, a measurable function of the observations satisfying M_n(\hat{\alpha}_n)\leq \min_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}M_n(\alpha)+c_n with \{c_n\}_{n\geq1} some sequence of real numbers going to zero. Under some standard regularity and moment assumptions, close to those of the i.i.d. case, the estimator \hat{\alpha}_n satisfies a Berry--Esseen theorem uniformly with respect to the underlying probability distribution of the Markov chain.
