We consider a linear stochastic bandit problem where the dimension K of the unknown parameter \theta is larger than the sampling budget n. In such cases, it is in general impossible to derive sub-linear regret bounds since usual linear bandit algorithms have a regret in O(K\sqrt{n}). In this paper we assume that \theta is S-sparse, i.e. has at most S-non-zero components, and that the space of arms is the unit ball for the ||.||_2 norm. We combine ideas from Compressed Sensing and Bandit Theory and derive algorithms with regret bounds in O(S\sqrt{n}).
