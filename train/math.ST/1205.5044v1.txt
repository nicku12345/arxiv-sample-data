We consider spatially homogeneous marked point patterns in an unboundedly expanding convex sampling window. Our main objective is to identify the distribution of the typical mark by constructing an asymptotic \chi^2-goodness-of-fit test. The corresponding test statistic is based on a natural empirical version of the Palm mark distribution and a smoothed covariance estimator which turns out to be mean-square consistent. Our approach does not require independent marks and allows dependences between the mark field and the point pattern. Instead we impose a suitable \beta-mixing condition on the underlying stationary marked point process which can be checked for a number of Poisson-based models and, in particular, in the case of geostatistical marking. Our method needs a central limit theorem for \beta-mixing random fields which is proved by extending Bernstein's blocking technique to non-cubic index sets and seems to be of interest in its own right. By large-scale model-based simulations the performance of our test is studied in dependence of the model parameters which determine the range of spatial correlations.
