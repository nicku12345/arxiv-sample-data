This paper studies the problem of nonparametric testing for the effect of a random functional covariate on a real-valued error term. The covariate takes values in L^2[0,1], the Hilbert space of the square-integrable real-valued functions on the unit interval. The error term could be directly observed as a response or \emph{estimated} from a functional parametric model, like for instance the functional linear regression. Our test is based on the remark that checking the no-effect of the functional covariate is equivalent to checking the nullity of the conditional expectation of the error term given a sufficiently rich set of projections of the covariate. Such projections could be on elements of norm 1 from finite-dimension subspaces of L^2[0,1]. Next, the idea is to search a finite-dimension element of norm 1 that is, in some sense, the least favorable for the null hypothesis. Finally, it remains to perform a nonparametric check of the nullity of the conditional expectation of the error term given the scalar product between the covariate and the selected least favorable direction. For such finite-dimension search and nonparametric check we use a kernel-based approach. As a result, our test statistic is a quadratic form based on univariate kernel smoothing and the asymptotic critical values are given by the standard normal law. The test is able to detect nonparametric alternatives, including the polynomial ones. The error term could present heteroscedasticity of unknown form. We do no require the law of the covariate X to be known. The test could be implemented quite easily and performs well in simulations and real data applications. We illustrate the performance of our test for checking the functional linear regression model.
