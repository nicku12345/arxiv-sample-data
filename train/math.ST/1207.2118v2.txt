We consider the problem of testing equality of functions f_j:[0,1]\to \mathbb{R} for j=1,2,...,J the basis of J independent samples from possibly different distributions under the assumption that the functions are monotone. We provide a uniform approach that covers testing equality of monotone regression curves, equality of monotone densities and equality of monotone hazards in the random censorship model. Two test statistics are proposed based on L_1-distances. We show that both statistics are asymptotically normal and we provide bootstrap implementations, which are shown to have critical regions with asymptotic level \alpha.
