In this paper, we show that the adaptive multidimensional increment ratio estimator of the long range memory parameter defined in Bardet and Dola (2012) satisfies a central limit theorem (CLT in the sequel) for a large semiparametric class of Gaussian fractionally integrated processes with memory parameter d \in (-0.5,1.25). Since the asymptotic variance of this CLT can be computed, tests of stationarity or nonstationarity distinguishing the assumptions d<0.5 and d \geq 0.5 are constructed. These tests are also consistent tests of unit root. Simulations done on a large benchmark of short memory, long memory and non stationary processes show the accuracy of the tests with respect to other usual stationarity or nonstationarity tests (LMC, V/S, ADF and PP tests). Finally, the estimator and tests are applied to log-returns of famous economic data and to their absolute value power laws.
