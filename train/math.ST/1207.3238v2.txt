This paper proposes two estimators of the joint entropy of the Type-II censored data. Consistency of both estimators is proved. Simulation results show that the second one shows less bias and root of mean square error (RMSE) than leading estimator. Also, two goodness of fit test statistics based on the Kullback-Leibler information with the Type-II censored data are established and their performances with the leading test statistics are compared. We provide a Monte Carlo simulation study which shows that the test statistics T^{(1)}_{m,n,r} and T^{(2)}_{m,n,r} show better powers than leading test statistics against the alternatives with monotone decreasing and monotone increasing hazard functions, respectively.
