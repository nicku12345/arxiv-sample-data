We prove several results on the behavior near t=0 of Y_t^{-t} for certain (0,\infty)-valued stochastic processes (Y_t)_{t>0}. In particular, we show for L\'{e}vy subordinators that the Pareto law on [1,\infty) is the only possible weak limit and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence. More generally, we also consider the weak convergence of tL(Y_t) as t\to0 for a decreasing function L that is slowly varying at zero. Various examples demonstrating the applicability of the results are presented.
