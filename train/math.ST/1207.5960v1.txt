In this paper, we develop statistical inference techniques for the unknown coefficient functions and single-index parameters in single-index varying-coefficient models. We first estimate the nonparametric component via the local linear fitting, then construct an estimated empirical likelihood ratio function and hence obtain a maximum empirical likelihood estimator for the parametric component. Our estimator for parametric component is asymptotically efficient, and the estimator of nonparametric component has an optimal convergence rate. Our results provide ways to construct the confidence region for the involved unknown parameter. We also develop an adjusted empirical likelihood ratio for constructing the confidence regions of parameters of interest. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the finite sample behaviors of the proposed methods.
