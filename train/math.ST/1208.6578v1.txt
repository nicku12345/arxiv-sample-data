The geometric formulation of fiducial probability employed in this paper is an improvement over the usual pivotal quantity formulation. For a single parameter and single observation, the new formulation is based on the geometric properties of an ordinary two variable function and its surface representation.   The following theorem is proved: A fiducial distribution for the continuous parameter \theta exists if and only if (i) the continuous random probability distributions of x for different \theta's are non-intersecting, and (ii) the random distributions are complete, i.e. at the extreme values of \theta the limiting probability distributions are zero and one for all x.   The proof yields also a complete characterization of random distributions that lead to fiducial distributions.   The paper also treats intersecting distributions and non-intersecting incomplete distributions. The latter, which are frequently encountered in a null hypothesis, are shown to be associated with intersecting "composite" distributions.   An appendix compares the pivotal and geometric formulations.
