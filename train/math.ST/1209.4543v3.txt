We point out that the ideas underlying some test procedures recently proposed for testing post-model-selection (and for some other test problems) in the econometrics literature have been around for quite some time in the statistics literature. We also sharpen some of these results in the statistics literature. Furthermore, we show that some intuitively appealing testing procedures, that have found their way into the econometrics literature, lead to tests that do not have desirable size properties, not even asymptotically.
