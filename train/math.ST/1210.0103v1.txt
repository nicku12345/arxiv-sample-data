Frequentist-style large-sample properties of Bayesian posterior distributions, such as consistency and convergence rates, are important considerations in nonparametric problems. In this paper we give an analysis of Bayesian asymptotics based primarily on predictive densities. Our analysis is unified in the sense that essentially the same approach can be taken to develop convergence rate results in iid, mis-specified iid, independent non-iid, and dependent data cases.
