This paper proposes the density and characteristic functions of a general matrix quadratic form \mathbf{X}^{*}\mathbf{AX}, when \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}^{*}, \mathbf{X} has a matrix multivariate elliptical distribution and \mathbf{X}^{*} denotes the usual conjugate transpose of \mathbf{X}. These results are obtained for real normed division algebras. With particular cases we obtained the density and characteristic functions of matrix quadratic forms for matrix multivariate normal, Pearson type VII, t and Cauchy distributions.
