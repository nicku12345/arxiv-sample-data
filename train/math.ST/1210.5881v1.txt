Extensions of previous linear regression models for interval data are presented. A more flexible simple linear model is formalized. The new model may express cross-relationships between mid-points and spreads of the interval data in a unique equation based on the interval arithmetic. Moreover, extensions to the multiple case are addressed. The associated least-squares estimation problem are solved. Empirical results and a real-life application are presented in order to show the applicability and the differences among the proposed models.
