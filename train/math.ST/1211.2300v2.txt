In this paper, we adopt a Bayesian point of view for predicting real continuous-time processes. We give two equivalent definitions of a Bayesian predictor and study some properties: admissibility, prediction sufficiency, non-unbiasedness, comparison with efficient predictors. Prediction of Poisson process and prediction of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the continuous and sampled situations are considered. Various simulations illustrate comparison with non-Bayesian predictors.
