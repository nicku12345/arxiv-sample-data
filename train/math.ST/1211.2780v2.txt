The main purpose is to estimate the regression function of a real random variable with functional explanatory variable by using a recursive nonparametric kernel approach. The mean square error and the almost sure convergence of a family of recursive kernel estimates of the regression function are derived. These results are established with rates and precise evaluation of the constant terms. Also, a central limit theorem for this class of estimators is established. The method is evaluated on simulations and real data set studies.
