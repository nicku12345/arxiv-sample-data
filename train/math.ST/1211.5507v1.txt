We consider the problem of testing the parametric form of the volatility for high frequency data. It is demonstrated that in the presence of microstructure noise commonly used tests do not keep the preassigned level and are inconsistent. The concept of preaveraging is used to construct new tests, which do not suffer from these drawbacks. These tests are based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Cramer-von-Mises functional of an integrated stochastic process, for which weak convergence to a (conditional) Gaussian process is established. The finite sample properties of a bootstrap version of the test are illustrated by means of a simulation study.
