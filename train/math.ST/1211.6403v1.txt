We give a new explicitly invertible approximation of the normal cumulative distribution function: \Phi(x) \simeq 1/2 + 1/2 \sqrt{1-{e}^{-x^2\frac{17+{x}^{2}}{26.694+2x^2}}}, \forall x \ge 0, with absolute error <4.00\cdot 10^{-5}, absolute value of the relative error <4.53\cdot 10^{-5}, which, beeing designed essentially for practical use, is much simpler than a previously published formula and, though less precise, still reaches 4 decimals of precision, and has a complexity essentially comparable with that of the approximation of the normal cumulative distribution function \Phi(x) immediatly derived from Winitzki's approximation of erf(x), reducing about 36% the absolute error and about 28% the relative error with respect to that, overcoming the threshold of 4 decimals of precision.
