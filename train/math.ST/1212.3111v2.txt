We consider the high order moments estimator of the frontier of a random pair introduced by Girard, S., Guillou, A., Stupfler, G. (2012). {\it Frontier estimation with kernel regression on high order moments}. In the present paper, we show that this estimator is strongly uniformly consistent on compact sets and its rate of convergence is given when the conditional cumulative distribution function belongs to the Hall class of distribution functions.
