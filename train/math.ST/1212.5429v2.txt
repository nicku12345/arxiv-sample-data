In this paper, we consider the so-called Shape Invariant Model which stands for the estimation of a function f^0 submitted to a random translation of law g^0 in a white noise model. We are interested in such a model when the law of the deformations is unknown. We aim to recover the law of the process \PP_{f^0,g^0} as well as f^0 and g^0. In this perspective, we adopt a Bayesian point of view and find prior on f and g such that the posterior distribution concentrates around \PP_{f^0,g^0} at a polynomial rate when n goes to +\infty. We obtain a logarithmic posterior contraction rate for the shape f^0 and the distribution g^0. We also derive logarithmic lower bounds for the estimation of f^0 and g^0 in a frequentist paradigm.
