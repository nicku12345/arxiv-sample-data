Kadilar and Cingi (2003) have introduced a family of estimators using auxiliary information in stratified random sampling. In this paper, we propose the ratio estimator for the estimation of population mean in the stratified random sampling by using the estimators in Bahl and Tuteja (1991) and Kadilar and Cingi (2003). Obtaining the mean square error (MSE) equations of the proposed estimators, we find theoretical conditions that the proposed estimators are more efficient than the other estimators. These theoretical findings are supported by a numerical example.
