In the framework of noisy quantum homodyne tomography with efficiency parameter 1/2 < \eta \leq 1, we propose a novel estimator of a quantum state whose density matrix elements \rho_{m,n} decrease like Ce^{-B(m+n)^{r/ 2}}, for fixed C\geq 1, B>0 and 0<r\leq 2. On the contrary to previous works, we focus on the case where r, C and B are unknown. The procedure estimates the matrix coefficients by a projection method on the pattern functions, and then by soft-thresholding the estimated coefficients.   We prove that under the \mathbb{L}_2 -loss our procedure is adaptive rate-optimal, in the sense that it achieves the same rate of conversgence as the best possible procedure relying on the knowledge of (r,B,C). Finite sample behaviour of our adaptive procedure are explored through numerical experiments.
