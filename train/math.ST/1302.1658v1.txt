This paper deals with the problem of estimating the finite population mean when some information on two auxiliary attributes are available. It is shown that the proposed estimator is more efficient than the usual mean estimator and other existing estimators. The study is also extended to two-phase sampling. The results have been illustrated numerically by taking empirical population considered in the literature.
