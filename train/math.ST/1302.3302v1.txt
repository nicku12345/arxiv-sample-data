This paper considers the asymptotic power of likelihood ratio test (LRT) for the identity test when the dimension p is large compared to the sample size n. The asymptotic distribution of LRT under alternatives is given and an explicit expression of the power is derived. A simulation study is carried out to compare LRT with other tests. All these studies show that LRT is a powerful test to detect eigenvalues around zero.   Key words and phrases: Covariance matrix, High dimensional data, Identity test, Likelihood ratio test, Power
