This paper revisits the prominent Fisher, Wilks, and Bernstein -- von Mises (BvM) results from different viewpoints. Particular issues to address are: nonasymptotic framework with just one finite sample, possible model misspecification, and a large parameter dimension. In particular, in the case of an i.i.d. sample, the mentioned results can be stated for any smooth parametric family provided that the dimension \(p \) of the parameter space satisfies the condition "\(p^{2}/n \) is small" for the Fisher expansion, while the Wilks and the BvM results require "\(p^{3}/n \) is small".
