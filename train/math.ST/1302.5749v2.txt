The exact expression is derived for the expected value, < {p_i}> , for the parameter for any bin i of a histogram following a multinomial distribution derived by sorting N observations into bins of B classes, if n_i of the observations are found to be sorted into bin i. This expected value is found to be  < {p_i}> = \frac {n_i + 1} {N + B}. The expected value for the variance is found to be \frac{< p_i > (1-< p_i >)}{N+B+1}. A general expression is derived to determine < {p_i}^z >  for arbitrary values of B and z. These expressions hold provided there is no \emph{a priori} reason for p_i associated with any bin to have a value that is exactly equal to 0. For the particular case of the binomial distribution (B=2), these estimators are tested by examining how often the value of p_{true}, the value which is used to generate sets of pseudo-random binomial variates, falls within 1.96 estimated standard deviations of the estimated value < p >. When compared with the results of identical, earlier reported tests for small sample sizes, the unbiased estimators derived here predictably outperform \emph{asymptotically} unbiased estimators
