We consider the problem of simultaneous detection and estimation under a sequential framework. In particular we are interested in sequential tests that distinguish between the null and the alternative hypothesis and every time the decision is in favor of the alternative they provide an estimate of a random parameter. As we demonstrate with our analysis treating the two subproblems separately with the corresponding optimal strategies does not result in the best possible performance. To enjoy optimality one needs to take into account the optimum estimator during the hypothesis testing phase.
