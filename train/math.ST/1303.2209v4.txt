We introduce the notions of scaling transition and distributional long-range dependence for stationary random fields Y on \mathbb {Z}^2 whose normalized partial sums on rectangles with sides growing at rates O(n) and O(n^{\gamma}) tend to an operator scaling random field V_{\gamma} on \mathbb {R}^2, for any \gamma>0. The scaling transition is characterized by the fact that there exists a unique \gamma_0>0 such that the scaling limits V_{\gamma} are different and do not depend on \gamma for \gamma>\gamma_0 and \gamma<\gamma_0. The existence of scaling transition together with anisotropic and isotropic distributional long-range dependence properties is demonstrated for a class of \alpha-stable (1<\alpha\le2) aggregated nearest-neighbor autoregressive random fields on \mathbb{Z}^2 with a scalar random coefficient A having a regularly varying probability density near the "unit root" A=1.
