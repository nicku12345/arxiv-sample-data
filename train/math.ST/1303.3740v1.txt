We provide a closed-form estimator based on the VARMA representation for the unrestricted multivariate GARCH(1,1). We show that all parameters can be derived using basic linear algebra tools. We show that the estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal distributed. Our results allow also to derive a closed form for the parameters in the context of temporal aggregation of multivariate GARCH(1,1) by solving the equations as in Hafner [2008].
