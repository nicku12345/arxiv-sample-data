Power law generalized covariance functions provide a simple model for describing the local behavior of an isotropic random field. This work seeks to extend this class of covariance functions to spatial-temporal processes for which the degree of smoothness in space and in time may differ while maintaining other desirable properties for the covariance functions, including the availability of explicit convergent and asymptotic series expansions.
