We propose a simple continuous time model for modeling the lead-lag effect between two financial assets. A two-dimensional process (X_t,Y_t) reproduces a lead-lag effect if, for some time shift \vartheta\in \mathbb{R}, the process (X_t,Y_{t+\vartheta}) is a semi-martingale with respect to a certain filtration. The value of the time shift \vartheta is the lead-lag parameter. Depending on the underlying filtration, the standard no-arbitrage case is obtained for \vartheta=0. We study the problem of estimating the unknown parameter \vartheta\in \mathbb{R}, given randomly sampled non-synchronous data from (X_t) and (Y_t). By applying a certain contrast optimization based on a modified version of the Hayashi-Yoshida covariation estimator, we obtain a consistent estimator of the lead-lag parameter, together with an explicit rate of convergence governed by the sparsity of the sampling design.
