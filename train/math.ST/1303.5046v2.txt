The paper extends the result of Harman and Pronzato [Stat. & Prob. Lett., 77:90--94, 2007], which corresponds to p=0, to all strictly concave criteria in Kiefer's \phi_p-class. Let \xi be any design on a compact set X\subset\mathbb{R}^m with a nonsingular information matrix \Mb(\xi), and let \delta be the maximum of the directional derivative F_{\phi_p}(\xi,x) over all x\in X. We show that any support point x_* of a \phi_p-optimal design satisfies the inequality F_{\phi_p}(\xi,x_*) \geq h_p[\Mb(\xi),\delta], where the bound h_p[\Mb(\xi),\delta] is easily computed: it requires the determination of the unique root of a simple univariate equation (polynomial when p is integer) in a given interval. The construction can be used to accelerate algorithms for \phi_p-optimal design and is illustrated on an example with A-optimal design.
