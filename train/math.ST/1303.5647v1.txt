We observe a N\times M matrix of independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables which are centered except for elements of some submatrix of size n\times m where the mean is larger than some a>0. The submatrix is sparse in the sense that n/N and m/M tend to 0, whereas n,\, m, \, N and M tend to infinity.   We consider the problem of selecting the random variables with significantly large mean values. We give sufficient conditions on a as a function of n,\, m,\,N and M and construct a uniformly consistent procedure in order to do sharp variable selection. We also prove the minimax lower bounds under necessary conditions which are complementary to the previous conditions. The critical values a^* separating the necessary and sufficient conditions are sharp (we show exact constants).   We note a gap between the critical values a^* for selection of variables and that of detecting that such a submatrix exists given by Butucea and Ingster (2012). When a^* is in this gap, consistent detection is possible but no consistent selector of the corresponding variables can be found.
