We show that the even- resp. odd-dimensional Schoenberg coefficients in Gegenbauer expansions of isotropic positive definite functions on the d-sphere can be expressed as linear combinations of Fourier resp. Legendre coefficients, and we give closed form expressions for the coefficients involved in these expansions.
