Bayesian inference for fractionally integrated exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (FIEGARCH) models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is described. A simulation study is presented to access the performance of the procedure, under the presence of long-memory in the volatility. Samples from FIEGARCH processes are obtained upon considering the generalized error distribution (GED) for the innovation process. Different values for the tail-thickness parameter \nu are considered covering both scenarios, innovation processes with lighter (\nu<2) and heavier (\nu>2) tails than the Gaussian distribution (\nu=2). A sensitivity analysis is performed by considering different prior density functions and by integrating (or not) the knowledge on the true parameter values to select the hyperparameter values.
