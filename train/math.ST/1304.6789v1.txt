There are often two important types of variation in functional data: the horizontal (or phase) variation and the vertical (or amplitude) variation. These two types of variation have been appropriately separated and modeled through a domain warping method (or curve registration) based on the Fisher Rao metric. This paper focuses on the analysis of the horizontal variation, captured by the domain warping functions. The square-root velocity function representation transforms the manifold of the warping functions to a Hilbert sphere. Motivated by recent results on manifold analogs of principal component analysis, we propose to analyze the horizontal variation via a Principal Nested Spheres approach. Compared with earlier approaches, such as approximating tangent plane principal component analysis, this is seen to be the most efficient and interpretable approach to decompose the horizontal variation in some examples.
