This paper proposes a general family of estimators for estimating the population mean in systematic sampling in the presence of non-response adapting the family of estimators proposed by Khoshnevisan et al. (2007). In this paper we have discussed the general properties of the proposed family including optimum property. The results have been illustrated numerically by taking an empirical population considered in the literature.
