A Bernstein-von Mises theorem is derived for general semiparametric functionals. The result is applied to a variety of semiparametric problems in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. situations. In particular, new tools are developed to handle semiparametric bias, in particular for nonlinear functionals and in cases where regularity is possibly low. Examples include the squared L^2-norm in Gaussian white noise, nonlinear functionals in density estimation, as well as functionals in autoregressive models. For density estimation, a systematic study of BvM results for two important classes of priors is provided, namely random histograms and Gaussian process priors.
