In this paper we propose a generalization of a class of Gaussian Semiparametric Estimators (GSE) of the fractional differencing parameter for long-range dependent multivariate time series. We generalize a known GSE-type estimator by introducing some modifications at the objective function level regarding the process' spectral density matrix estimator. We study large sample properties of the estimator without assuming Gaussianity as well as hypothesis testing. The class of models considered here satisfies simple conditions on the spectral density function, restricted to a small neighborhood of the zero frequency. This includes, but is not limited to, the class of VARFIMA models. A simulation study to assess the finite sample properties of the proposed estimator is presented and supports its competitiveness. We also present an empirical application to an exchange rate data.
