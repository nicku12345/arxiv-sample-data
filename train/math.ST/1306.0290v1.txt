Consider randomly picked points inside the n-dimensional unit hypersphere centered at the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system. The Cartesian coordinates of the points are random variables, which form an n-dimensional vector for each point. Observing only the x-coordinate I obtained its probability density function (PDF). I show that it is related to the Gaussian distribution: in limit its companion PDF?? converges to the PDF of the standard normal distribution.
