A moment bound for the normalized conditional-sum-of-squares (CSS) estimate of a general autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model with an arbitrary unknown memory parameter is derived in this paper. To achieve this goal, a uniform moment bound for the inverse of the normalized objective function is established. An important application of these results is to establish asymptotic expressions for the one-step and multi-step mean squared prediction errors (MSPE) of the CSS predictor. These asymptotic expressions not only explicitly demonstrate how the multi-step MSPE of the CSS predictor manifests with the model complexity and the dependent structure, but also offer means to compare the performance of the CSS predictor with the least squares (LS) predictor for integrated autoregressive models. It turns out that the CSS predictor can gain substantial advantage over the LS predictor when the integration order is high. Numerical findings are also conducted to illustrate the theoretical results.
