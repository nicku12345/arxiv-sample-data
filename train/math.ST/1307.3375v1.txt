In this paper, we develop a new method to estimate the parameters of a deteriorating system under perfect condition-based maintenance. This method is based on the asymptotical behavior of the system, which is studied by using the renewal process theory. We obtain a Central Limit Theorem (CLT in the following) for the parameters. We compare the accuracy and the speed of the method with the maximum likelihood one (ML method in the following) on different examples.
