We consider the problem of estimating a continuous distribution function F, as well as meaningful functions \tau(F) under a large class of loss functions. We obtain best invariant estimators and establish their minimaxity for H\"{o}lder continuous \tau's and strict bowl-shaped losses with a bounded derivative. We also introduce and motivate the use of integrated balanced loss functions which combine the criteria of an integrated distance between a decision d and F, with the proximity of d with a target estimator d_0. Moreover, we show how the risk analysis of procedures under such an integrated balanced loss relates to a dual risk analysis under an "unbalanced" loss, and we derive best invariant estimators, minimax estimators, risk comparisons, dominance and inadmissibility results. Finally, we expand on various illustrations and applications relative to maxima-nomination sampling, median-nomination sampling, and a case study related to bilirubin levels in the blood of babies suffering from jaundice.
