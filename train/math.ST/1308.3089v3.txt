The LAN property is proved in the statistical model based on discrete-time observations of a solution to a L\'{e}vy driven SDE. The proof is based on a general sufficient condition for a statistical model based on a discrete observations of a Markov process to possess the LAN property, and involves substantially the Malliavin calculus-based integral representations for derivatives of log-likelihood of the model.
