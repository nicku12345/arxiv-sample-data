In multivariate statistics, acyclic mixed graphs with directed and bidirected edges are widely used for compact representation of dependence structures that can arise in the presence of hidden (i.e., latent or unobserved) variables. Indeed, under multivariate normality, every mixed graph corresponds to a set of covariance matrices that contains as a full-dimensional subset the covariance matrices associated with a causally interpretable acyclic digraph. This digraph generally has some of its nodes corresponding to hidden variables. We seek to clarify for which mixed graphs there exists an acyclic digraph whose hidden variable model coincides with the mixed graph model. Restricting to the tractable setting of chain graphs and multivariate normality, we show that decomposability of the bidirected part of the chain graph is necessary and sufficient for equality between the mixed graph model and some hidden variable model given by an acyclic digraph.
