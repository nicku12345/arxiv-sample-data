In this paper, a procedure is given for estimating the population mean in simple random sampling without replacement in the presence of auxiliary information. The mean squared error expressions of the proposed estimators have been derived under large sample approximation. We have compared the performances of the proposed estimators with several existing estimators. Both theoretical and empirical findings are encouraging and support the soundness of the proposed procedure for mean estimation.
