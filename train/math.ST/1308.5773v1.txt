The purpose of writing this book is to suggest some improved estimators using auxiliary information in sampling schemes like simple random sampling and systematic sampling.   This volume is a collection of five papers. The following problems have been discussed in the book:   In chapter one an estimator in systematic sampling using auxiliary information is studied in the presence of non-response. In second chapter some improved estimators are suggested using auxiliary information. In third chapter some improved ratio-type estimators are suggested and their properties are studied under second order of approximation.   In chapter four and five some estimators are proposed for estimating unknown population parameter(s) and their properties are studied.   This book will be helpful for the researchers and students who are working in the field of finite population estimation.
