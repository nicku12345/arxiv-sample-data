This paper proposes a class of ratio type estimators of finite population variance, when the population variance of an auxiliary character is known. Asymptotic expression for mean square error (MSE) is derived and compared with the mean square errors of some existing estimators. An empirical study is carried out to illustrate the performance of the constructed estimator over others.
