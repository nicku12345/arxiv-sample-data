Chakrabarty, Khoshnevisan, Sahai and Ray, Solanki suggested some estimators to estimate unknown population mean of the study variable. These authors discussed the estimators along with their first order biases and mean square errors(MSEs). In this paper, we have tried to found out the second order biases and mean square errors of some estimators using information on auxiliary attribute. We have compared the performance of the estimators with the help of a numerical illustration.
