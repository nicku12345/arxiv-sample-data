Some improved estimators are proposed for estimating the population mean in stratified sampling in the presence of auxiliary information. Mean square error (MSE) of the proposed estimators have been derived under large sample approximation. It has been shown that under optimum conditions proposed estimators are better than usual unbiased estimator and Hansen (1946) estimator. Both theoretical and empirical findings are encouraging and support the soundness of the proposed procedure for mean estimation.
