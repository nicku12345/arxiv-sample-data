In this paper we deal with the estimation of population variance of the study variable y using auxiliary information on variable x. A family of ratio and product-type estimators are proposed using suitable transformation on both random variable x(auxiliary variable) and(study variable).Up to the first order of approximation the expression of mean square error and Bias term are obtained. An empirical study is carried out to illustrate the performance of the constructed estimator over others.
