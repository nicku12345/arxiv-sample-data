Stochastic processes are often used to model complex scientific problems in fields ranging from biology and finance to engineering and physical science. This paper investigates rate-optimal estimation of the volatility matrix of a high-dimensional It\^{o} process observed with measurement errors at discrete time points. The minimax rate of convergence is established for estimating sparse volatility matrices. By combining the multi-scale and threshold approaches we construct a volatility matrix estimator to achieve the optimal convergence rate. The minimax lower bound is derived by considering a subclass of It\^{o} processes for which the minimax lower bound is obtained through a novel equivalent model of covariance matrix estimation for independent but nonidentically distributed observations and through a delicate construction of the least favorable parameters. In addition, a simulation study was conducted to test the finite sample performance of the optimal estimator, and the simulation results were found to support the established asymptotic theory.
