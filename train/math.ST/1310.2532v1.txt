This paper is dedicated to the study of an estimator of the generalized Hoeffding decomposition. We build such an estimator using an empirical Gram-Schmidt approach and derive a consistency rate in a large dimensional settings.   Then, we apply a greedy algorithm with these previous estimators to Sensitivity Analysis. We also establish the consistency of this \mathbb L_2-boosting up to sparsity assumptions on the signal to analyse. We end the paper with numerical experiments, which demonstrates the low computational cost of our method as well as its efficiency on standard benchmark of Sensitivity Analysis.
