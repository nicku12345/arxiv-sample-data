We provide a bird's eye view onto the area of sequential change-point detection. We focus on the discrete-time case with known pre- and post-change data distributions and offer a summary of the forefront asymptotic results established in each of the four major formulations of the underlying optimization problem: Bayesian, generalized Bayesian, minimax, and multi-cyclic.
