This paper gives a way to simulate from the two star probability distribution on the space of simple graphs via auxiliary variables. Using this simulation scheme, the model is explored for various domains of the parameter values, and the phase transition boundaries are identified, and shown to be similar as that of the Curie-Weiss model of statistical physics. Concentration results are obtained for all the degrees, which further validate the phase transition predictions.
