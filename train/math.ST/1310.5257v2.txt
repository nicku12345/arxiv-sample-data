We discuss joint temporal and contemporaneous aggregation of N independent copies of AR(1) process with random-coefficient a \in [0,1) when N and time scale n increase at different rate. Assuming that a has a density, regularly varying at a = 1 with exponent -1 < \beta < 1, different joint limits of normalized aggregated partial sums are shown to exist when N^{1/(1+\beta)}/n tends to (i) \infty, (ii) 0, (iii) 0 < \mu < \infty. The limit process arising under (iii) admits a Poisson integral representation on (0,\infty) \times C(\mathbb{R}) and enjoys "intermediate" properties between fractional Brownian motion limit in (i) and sub-Gaussian limit in (ii).
