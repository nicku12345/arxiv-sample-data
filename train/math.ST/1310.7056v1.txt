In this note, the practical use of priors for Bayes estimators, of the two parameters of the Weibull reliability model, is discussed in a technological context. The meaning of the priors as expression of virtual data samples is analyzed. The implications of physics of failures are also highlighted. The whole analysis shows a rational way to convert a really available technological knowledge into prior information, effectively and without a long elicitation process. A large Monte Carlo study, on both complete and censored samples of small size, shows the good properties of some estimators, which can exploit such a new approach.
