In this report, oracle inequalities on the excess risk of the empirical risk minimizer in the quantization framework are derived. These inequalities are based on conditions which may be thought of as margin type conditions, such as one derived in the statistical learning framework. Furthermore, these inequalities derive from innovative chaining techniques and its use for Dudley's entropy integral.
