In this paper, we establish the theory of weak convergence (toward a normal distribution) for both single-chain and population stochastic approximation MCMC algorithms. Based on the theory, we give an explicit ratio of convergence rates for the population SAMCMC algorithm and the single-chain SAMCMC algorithm. Our results provide a theoretic guarantee that the population SAMCMC algorithms are asymptotically more efficient than the single-chain SAMCMC algorithms when the gain factor sequence decreases slower than O(1/t), where t indexes the number of iterations. This is of interest for practical applications.
