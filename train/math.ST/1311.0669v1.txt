Avila and Jitomirskaya prove that the spectral measure \mu_{\lambda v, \alpha,x}^f of quasi-periodic Schr\"{o}dinger operator is 1/2-H\"{o}lder continuous with appropriate initial vector f, if \alpha  satisfies Diophantine condition and \lambda is small. In the present paper, the conclusion is extended to that for all \alpha with \beta(\alpha)<\infty, the spectral measure \mu_{\lambda v, \alpha,x}^f is 1/2-H\"{o}lder continuous with small \lambda, if v is real analytic in a neighbor of \{|\Im x|\leq C\beta\}, where C is a large absolute constant. In particular, the spectral measure \mu_{\lambda, \alpha,x}^f of almost Mathieu operator is 1/2-H\"{o}lder continuous if |\lambda|<e^{-C\beta} with C a large absolute constant.
