A new characterization of the multivariate so-called "quasi-Gaussian distribution" (the authors dared to coin a new term) by means of independence their Cartesian and polar coordinates proposed.   The authors try to show that these distributions may essentially differ from the classical Gaussian distribution. Some properties of these distributions are studied: calculating of moments and of bilateral tail behavior. Some potential applications of these distributions and mixtures of the distributions in demography, philology are discussed in the final section.
