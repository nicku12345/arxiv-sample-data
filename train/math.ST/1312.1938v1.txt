A projective moving average \{X_t, t \in \mathbb{Z}\} is a Bernoulli shift written as a backward martingale transform of the innovation sequence. We introduce a new class of nonlinear stochastic equations for projective moving averages, termed projective equations, involving a (nonlinear) kernel Q and a linear combination of projections of X_t on "intermediate" lagged innovation subspaces with given coefficients \alpha_i, \beta_{i,j}. The class of such equations include usual moving-average processes and the Volterra series of the LARCH model. Solvability of projective equations is studied, including a nested Volterra series representation of the solution X_t. We show that under natural conditions on Q, \alpha_i, \beta_{i,j}, this solution exhibits covariance and distributional long memory, with fractional Brownian motion as the limit of the corresponding partial sums process.
