The auto-cross covariance matrix is defined as \[\mathbf{M}_n=\frac{1} {2T}\sum_{j=1}^T\bigl(\mathbf{e}_j\mathbf{e}_{j+\tau}^*+\mathbf{e}_{j+ \tau}\mathbf{e}_j^*\bigr),\] where \mathbf{e}_j's are n-dimensional vectors of independent standard complex components with a common mean 0, variance \sigma^2, and uniformly bounded 2+\etath moments and \tau is the lag. Jin et al. [Ann. Appl. Probab. 24 (2014) 1199-1225] has proved that the LSD of \mathbf{M}_n exists uniquely and nonrandomly, and independent of \tau for all \tau\ge 1. And in addition they gave an analytic expression of the LSD. As a continuation of Jin et al. [Ann. Appl. Probab. 24 (2014) 1199-1225], this paper proved that under the condition of uniformly bounded fourth moments, in any closed interval outside the support of the LSD, with probability 1 there will be no eigenvalues of \mathbf{M}_n for all large n. As a consequence of the main theorem, the limits of the largest and smallest eigenvalue of \mathbf{M}_n are also obtained.
