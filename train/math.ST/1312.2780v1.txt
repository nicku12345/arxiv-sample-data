In this paper we consider a heavy-tailed stochastic volatility model, X_t=\sigma_tZ_t, t\in\mathbb{Z}, where the volatility sequence (\sigma_t) and the i.i.d. noise sequence (Z_t) are assumed independent, (\sigma_t) is regularly varying with index \alpha>0, and the Z_t's have moments of order larger than \alpha. In the literature (see Ann. Appl. Probab. 8 (1998) 664-675, J. Appl. Probab. 38A (2001) 93-104, In Handbook of Financial Time Series (2009) 355-364 Springer), it is typically assumed that (\log\sigma_t) is a Gaussian stationary sequence and the Z_t's are regularly varying with some index \alpha (i.e., (\sigma_t) has lighter tails than the Z_t's), or that (Z_t) is i.i.d. centered Gaussian. In these cases, we see that the sequence (X_t) does not exhibit extremal clustering. In contrast to this situation, under the conditions of this paper, both situations are possible; (X_t) may or may not have extremal clustering, depending on the clustering behavior of the \sigma-sequence.
