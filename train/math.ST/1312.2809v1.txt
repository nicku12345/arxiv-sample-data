We display several examples of generalized gamma convoluted and hyperbolically completely monotone random variables related to positive \alpha-stable laws. We also obtain new factorizations for the latter, refining Kanter's and Pestana-Shanbhag-Sreehari's. These results give stronger credit to Bondesson's hypothesis that positive \alpha-stable densities are hyperbolically completely monotone whenever \alpha\le1/2.
