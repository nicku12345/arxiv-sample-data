This article addresses the problem of estimating the population mean in the presence of auxiliary information when study variable itself is qualitative in nature. Bias and mean squared error (MSE) expressions of the class of estimators are derived up to the first order of approximation. The suggested estimators have been compared with the traditional estimator and several other estimators considered by Singh (2010). In addition, we support this theoretical result by an empirical study to show the superiority of the constructed estimator over others.
