We consider a nonparametric regression model Y=r(X)+\varepsilon with a random covariate X that is independent of the error \varepsilon. Then the density of the response Y is a convolution of the densities of \varepsilon and r(X). It can therefore be estimated by a convolution of kernel estimators for these two densities, or more generally by a local von Mises statistic. If the regression function has a nowhere vanishing derivative, then the convolution estimator converges at a parametric rate. We show that the convergence holds uniformly, and that the corresponding process obeys a functional central limit theorem in the space C_0(\mathbb {R}) of continuous functions vanishing at infinity, endowed with the sup-norm. The estimator is not efficient. We construct an additive correction that makes it efficient.
