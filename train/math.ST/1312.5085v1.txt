Quaternary code (QC) designs form an attractive class of nonregular factorial fractions. We develop a complementary set theory for characterizing optimal QC designs that are highly fractionated in the sense of accommodating a large number of factors. This is in contrast to existing theoretical results which work only for a relatively small number of factors. While the use of imaginary numbers to represent the Gray map associated with QC designs facilitates the derivation, establishing a link with foldovers of regular fractions helps in presenting our results in a neat form.
