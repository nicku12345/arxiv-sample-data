This survey provides a self-contained account of M-estimation of multivariate scatter. In particular, we present new proofs for existence of the underlying M-functionals and discuss their weak continuity and differentiability. This is done in a rather general framework with matrix-valued random variables. By doing so we reveal a connection between Tyler's (1987) M-functional of scatter and the estimation of proportional covariance matrices. Moreover, this general framework allows us to treat a new class of scatter estimators, based on symmetrizations of arbitrary order. Finally these results are applied to M-estimation of multivariate location and scatter via multivariate t-distributions.
