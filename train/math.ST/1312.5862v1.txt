This paper is devoted to the estimation of the shift parameter in a semiparametric regression model when the distribution of the observation times is unknown. Hence, we propose to use a stochastic algorithm which takes into account the estimation of the distribution of the observation times. We establish the almost sure convergence of our estimator and the asymptotic normality. The main result of the paper is that, with little assumptions on the regularity of the regression function, the asymptotic variance obtained is the same as when the distribution is known. In that sense, we improve the recent work of Bercu and Fraysse.
