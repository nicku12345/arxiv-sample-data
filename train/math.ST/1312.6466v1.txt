Let Y be a stochastic process on [0,1] satisfying dY(t) = n^{1/2} f(t) dt + dW(t), where n \ge 1 is a given scale parameter (``sample size''), W is standard Brownian motion and f is an unknown function. Utilizing suitable multiscale tests we construct confidence bands for f with guaranteed given coverage probability, assuming that f is isotonic or convex. These confidence bands are computationally feasible and shown to be asymptotically sharp optimal in an appropriate sense.
