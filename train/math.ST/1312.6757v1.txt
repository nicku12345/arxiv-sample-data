Recently we proposed quantum language(or, measurement theory), which is characterized as the linguistic turn of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Also, we consider that this is a kind of system theory such that it is applicable to both classical and quantum systems. As far as classical systems, it should be noted that quantum language is similar to statistics. In this paper, we discuss the usual confidence interval methods in terms of quantum language. And we assert that three concepts (i.e.,"estimator" and "quantity" and "semi-distance)are indispensable for the theoretical understanding of the confidence interval methods. Since our argument is quite elementary, we hope that the readers acquire a new viewpoint of statistics, and agree that our proposal is, from the pure theoretical point of view, the true confidence interval methods.
