The paper proposes one-to-one transformation of the vector of components \{Y_{in}\}_{i=1}^m of Pearson's chi-square statistic, \[Y_{in}=\frac{\nu_{in}-np_i}{\sqrt{np_i}},\qquad i=1,\ldots,m,\] into another vector \{Z_{in}\}_{i=1}^m, which, therefore, contains the same "statistical information," but is asymptotically distribution free. Hence any functional/test statistic based on \{Z_{in}\}_{i=1}^m is also asymptotically distribution free. Natural examples of such test statistics are traditional goodness-of-fit statistics from partial sums \sum_{I\leq k}Z_{in}. The supplement shows how the approach works in the problem of independent interest: the goodness-of-fit testing of power-law distribution with the Zipf law and the Karlin-Rouault law as particular alternatives.
