Although there are many ideas for the formulations of statistical hypothesis testing, we consider that the likelihood ratio test is the most reasonable and orthodox. However, it is not handy, and thus, it is not usual in elementary books. That is, the statistical hypothesis testing written in elementary books is different from the likelihood ratio test. Thus, from the theoretical point of view, we have the following question: "What is the statistical hypothesis testing written in elementary books?" For example, we consider that even the difference between "one sided test" and "two sided test" is not clear yet. In this paper, we give an answer to this question. That is, we propose a new formulation of statistical hypothesis testing, which is contrary to the confidence interval methods. In other words, they are two sides of the same coin. This will be done in quantum language (or, measurement theory), which is characterized as the linguistic turn of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, and also, a kind of system theory such that it is applicable to both classical and quantum systems. Since quantum language is suited for theoretical arguments, we believe that our results are essentially final as a general theory.
