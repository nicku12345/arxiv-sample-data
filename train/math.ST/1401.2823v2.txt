We derive explicit expressions for a family of radially symmetric, non-differentiable, Spartan covariance functions in \mathbb{R}^2 that involve the modified Bessel function of the second kind. In addition to the characteristic length and the amplitude coefficient, the Spartan covariance parameters include the rigidity coefficient \eta_{1} which determines the shape of the covariance function. If  \eta_{1} >> 1 Spartan covariance functions exhibit multiscaling. We also derive a family of radially symmetric, infinitely differentiable Bessel-Lommel covariance functions valid in \mathbb{R}^{d}, d\ge 2. We investigate the parametric dependence of the integral range for Spartan and Bessel-Lommel covariance functions using explicit relations and numerical simulations. Finally, we define a generalized spectrum of correlation scales \lambda^{(\alpha)}_{c} in terms of the fractional Laplacian of the covariance function; for 0 \le \alpha \le1 the \lambda^{(\alpha)}_{c} extend from the smoothness microscale (\alpha=1) to the integral range (\alpha=0). The smoothness scale of mean-square continuous but non-differentiable random fields vanishes; such fields, however, can be discriminated by means of \lambda^{(\alpha)}_{c} scales obtained for \alpha <1.
