We consider discrete time Heath-Jarrow-Morton type interest rate models, where the interest rate curves are driven by a geometric spatial autoregression field. Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters are proved for stable no-arbitrage models containing a general stochastic discounting factor, where explicit form of the ML estimators is not available given a non-i.i.d. sample. The results form the basis of further statistical problems in such models.
