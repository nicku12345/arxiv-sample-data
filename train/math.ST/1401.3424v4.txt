This paper studies the limiting behavior of Tyler's M-estimator for the scatter matrix, in the regime that the number of samples n and their dimension p both go to infinity, and p/n converges to a constant y with 0<y<1. We prove that when the data samples x_1, \ldots, x_n are identically and independently generated from the Gaussian distribution \mathcal{N}(0, I), the operator norm of the difference between a properly scaled Tyler's M-estimator and \sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i^\top/n tends to zero. As a result, the spectral distribution of Tyler's M-estimator converges weakly to the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur distribution.
