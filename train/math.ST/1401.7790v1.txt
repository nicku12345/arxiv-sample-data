It has been shown that local algorithms based on grey-scale images sometimes lead to asymptotically unbiased estimators for surface area and integrated mean curvature. This paper extends the results to estimators for Minkowski tensors. In particular, asymptotically unbiased local algorithms for estimation of all volume and surface tensors and certain mean curvature tensors are given. This requires an extension of the known asymptotic formulas to estimators with position dependent weights.
