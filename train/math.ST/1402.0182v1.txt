The main aim of this article is to characterize and investigate the three parameter exponentiated exponential Poisson probability distribution {\rm EEP}(\alpha, \beta, \lambda) by giving explicit closed form expressions for its characteristic function \phi_\xi(t) and moment generating function M_\xi(t), and finally, to show that the existing series and integral form expressions for positive integer order moments \mathbb E\xi^\nu, \nu \in \mathbb N are in fact valid for all \nu>1-\alpha, \alpha>0.
