We prove the Simons-Johnson theorem for the sums S_n of m-dependent random variables, with exponential weights and limiting compound Poisson distribution \CP(s,\lambda). More precisely, we give sufficient conditions for \sum_{k=0}^\infty\ee^{hk}\ab{P(S_n=k)-\CP(s,\lambda)\{k\}}\to 0 and provide an estimate on the rate of convergence. It is shown that the Simons-Johnson theorem holds for weighted Wasserstein norm as well. %limiting sum of two Poisson variables defined on %different lattices. The results are then illustrated for N(n;k_1,k_2) and k-runs statistics.
