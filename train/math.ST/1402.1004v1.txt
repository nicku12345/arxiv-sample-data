The evaluation of integral transforms of special functions is required in different research and practical areas. Analyzing the \kappa-\mu fading distribution also khown as the generalized Rician distribution, we find out that the assessment of a few different performance metrics, such as the probability of energy detection of unknown signals and outage probability under co-channel interference, involves the evaluation of an infinite-range integral, which has the form of Laplace transform of product of Marcum Q, Bessel I, and power functions. We evaluate this integral in a closed-form and present numerical estimates.
