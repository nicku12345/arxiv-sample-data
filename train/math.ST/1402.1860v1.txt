We derive contrast measures which involve the number of looks and the complex correlation coefficient between polarization channels in PolSAR imagery. Using asymptotic results which characterize the behavior of these measures, we derive statistical regions of confidence which lead to test of hypothesis. An application to real data is performed, confirming the importance of the proposals.
