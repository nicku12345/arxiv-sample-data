Supposing Kotz-Riesz type I and II distributions and their corresponding independent univariate Riesz distributions the associated generalised matrix multivariate T distributions, termed matrix multivariate T-Riesz distributions are obtained. In addition, its various properties are studied. All these results are obtained for real normed division algebras.
