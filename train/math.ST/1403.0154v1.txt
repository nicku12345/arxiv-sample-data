Singh and Kumar (2011) suggested estimators for calculating population variance using auxiliary attributes. This paper proposes a family of estimators based on an adaptation of the estimators presented by Kadilar and Cingi (2004) and Singh et al. (2007), and introduces a new family of estimators using auxiliary attributes. The expressions of the mean square errors (MSEs) of the adapted and proposed families are derived. It is shown that adapted estimators and suggested estimators are more efficient than Singh and Kumar (2011) estimators. The theoretical findings are supported by a numerical example.
