In this paper, the area swept under the workload graph is analyzed: with \{Q(t) : t\ge0\} denoting the stationary workload process, the asymptotic behavior of \[\pi_{T(u)}(u):={\mathbb{P}}\biggl(\int_0^ {T(u)}Q(r)\,\mathrm{d}r>u\biggr)\] is analyzed. Focusing on regulated Brownian motion, first the exact asymptotics of \pi_{T(u)}(u) are given for the case that T(u) grows slower than \sqrt{u}, and then logarithmic asymptotics for (i) T(u)=T\sqrt{u} (relying on sample-path large deviations), and (ii) \sqrt{u}=\mathrm{o}(T(u)) but T(u)=\mathrm{o}(u). Finally, the Laplace transform of the residual busy period are given in terms of the Airy function.
