Incomplete rankings on a set of items \{1,\; \ldots,\; n\} are orderings of the form a_{1}\prec\dots\prec a_{k}, with \{a_{1},\dots a_{k}\}\subset\{1,\dots,n\} and k < n. Though they arise in many modern applications, only a few methods have been introduced to manipulate them, most of them consisting in representing any incomplete ranking by the set of all its possible linear extensions on \{1,\; \ldots,\; n\}. It is the major purpose of this paper to introduce a completely novel approach, which allows to treat incomplete rankings directly, representing them as injective words over \{1,\; \ldots,\; n\}. Unexpectedly, operations on incomplete rankings have very simple equivalents in this setting and the topological structure of the complex of injective words can be interpretated in a simple fashion from the perspective of ranking. We exploit this connection here and use recent results from algebraic topology to construct a multiresolution analysis and develop a wavelet framework for incomplete rankings. Though purely combinatorial, this construction relies on the same ideas underlying multiresolution analysis on a Euclidean space, and permits to localize the information related to rankings on each subset of items. It can be viewed as a crucial step toward nonlinear approximation of distributions of incomplete rankings and paves the way for many statistical applications, including preference data analysis and the design of recommender systems.
