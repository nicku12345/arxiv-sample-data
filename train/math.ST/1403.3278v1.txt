The paper suggests a simple method of deriving minimax lower bounds to the accuracy of statistical inference on heavy tails. A well-known result by Hall and Welsh (Ann. Statist. 12 (1984) 1079-1084) states that if \hat{\alpha}_n is an estimator of the tail index \alpha_P and \{z_n\} is a sequence of positive numbers such that \sup_{P\in{\mathcal{D}}_r}\mathbb{P}(|\hat{\alpha}_n-\alpha_P|\ge z_n)\to0, where {\mathcal{D}}_r is a certain class of heavy-tailed distributions, then z_n\gg n^{-r}. The paper presents a non-asymptotic lower bound to the probabilities \mathbb{P}(|\hat{\alpha}_n-\alpha_P|\ge z_n). We also establish non-uniform lower bounds to the accuracy of tail constant and extreme quantiles estimation. The results reveal that normalising sequences of robust estimators should depend in a specific way on the tail index and the tail constant.
