A d-dimensional RCA(1) process is a generalization of the d-dimensional AR(1) process, such that the coefficients \{M_t;t=1,2,\ldots\} are i.i.d. random matrices. In the case d=1, under a nondegeneracy condition, Goldie and Maller gave necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence in distribution of an RCA(1) process, and for the almost sure convergence of a closely related sum of random variables called a perpetuity. We here prove that under the condition \Vert {\prod_{t=1}^nM_t}\Vert \stackrel{\mathrm{a.s.}}{\longrightarrow}0 as n\to\infty, most of the results of Goldie and Maller can be extended to the case d>1. If this condition does not hold, some of their results cannot be extended.
