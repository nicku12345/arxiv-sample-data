Contingency table analysis routinely relies on log linear models, with latent structure analysis providing a common alternative. Latent structure models lead to a low rank tensor factorization of the probability mass function for multivariate categorical data, while log linear models achieve dimensionality reduction through sparsity. Little is known about the relationship between these notions of dimensionality reduction in the two paradigms. We derive several results relating the support of a log-linear model to the nonnegative rank of the associated probability tensor. Motivated by these findings, we propose a new collapsed Tucker class of tensor decompositions, which bridge existing PARAFAC and Tucker decompositions, providing a more flexible framework for parsimoniously characterizing multivariate categorical data. Taking a Bayesian approach to inference, we illustrate advantages of the new decompositions in simulations and an application to functional disability data.
