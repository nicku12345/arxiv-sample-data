The present paper presents the detail discussion on estimation of population mean in simple random sampling in the presence of non-response. Motivated by Gupta and Shabbir (2008), we have suggested the class of estimators of population mean using an auxiliary variable under non-response. A theoretical study is carried out using two-phase sampling scheme when the population mean of auxiliary variable is not known. An empirical study has also been done in the support of theoretical results.
