We shall show that for {\it any} MA(2) process (apart from those with coefficients \theta_1,\theta_2  lying on certain line-segments) there is {\it one and only one invertible} MA(2) process with the {\it same} autocovariances \gamma_0,\gamma_1,\gamma_2. It is this invertible version which computer-packages fit, regardless, even if data came from a non-invertible MA(2) process. This has consequences for prediction from a fitted process, inasmuch as such prediction would seem to be inappropriate. We express the coefficients \theta_1,\theta_2  of the invertible version in terms of \gamma_0,\gamma_1,\gamma_2 explicitly using analytical reasoning, following a graphical approach of Sbrana (2012) which indicates this result within the invertibility region. We also express (\theta_1,\theta_2) in the non-invertibility region.
