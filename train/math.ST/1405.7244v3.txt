We develop an asymptotic theory for L^2 norms of sample mean vectors of high-dimensional data. An invariance principle for the L^2 norms is derived under conditions that involve a delicate interplay between the dimension p, the sample size n and the moment condition. Under proper normalization, central and non-central limit theorems are obtained. To facilitate the related statistical inference, we propose a plug-in calibration method and a re-sampling procedure to approximate the distributions of the L^2 norms. Our results are applied to multiple tests and inference of covariance matrix structures.
