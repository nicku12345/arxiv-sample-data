The data (y_i,x_i)\in \textbf{R}\times[a,b], i=1,\ldots,n satisfy y_i=s(x_i)+e_i where s belongs to the set of cubic splines. The unknown noises (e_i) are such that var(e_I)=1 for some I\in \{1, \ldots, n\} and var(e_i)=\sigma^2 for i\neq I. We suppose that the most important noise is e_I, i.e. the ratio r_I=\frac{1}{\sigma^2} is larger than one. If the ratio r_I is large, then we show, for all smoothing parameter, that the penalized least squares estimator of the B-spline basis recovers exactly the position I and the sign of the most important noise e_I.
