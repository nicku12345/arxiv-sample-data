The M-estimators of multivariate scatter are known to have breakdown points no greater than 1/(p+1), where p is the dimension of the data. In high dimension, the breakdown points are usually considered to be disappointingly low. This paper studies the breakdown problem in more detail. The exact breakdown points for the M-estimators of scatter are obtained and it is shown that their low values are primarily due to contamination restricted to some plane. If such "coplanar" contamination is not present, then there exists M-estimators which have breakdown points close to 1/2. The effect of coplanar contamination is further examined and is shown to be related to the singularity of the scatter matrix. Finally, the implications of the results of this paper on whether the low breakdown point is necessarily a bad feature and on multivariate outlier detection are briefly discussed.
