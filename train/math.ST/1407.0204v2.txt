In an early paper, He and Tang [Biometrika 100 (2013) 254-260] introduced and studied a new class of designs, strong orthogonal arrays, for computer experiments, and characterized such arrays through generalized orthogonal arrays. The current paper presents a simple characterization for strong orthogonal arrays of strength three. Besides being simple, this new characterization through a notion of semi-embeddability is more direct and penetrating in terms of revealing the structure of strong orthogonal arrays. Some other results on strong orthogonal arrays of strength three are also obtained along the way, and in particular, two \operatorname {SOA}(54,5,27,3)'s are constructed.
