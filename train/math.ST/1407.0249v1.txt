We introduce a new variational estimator for the intensity function of an inhomogeneous spatial point process with points in the d-dimensional Euclidean space and observed within a bounded region. The variational estimator applies in a simple and general setting when the intensity function is assumed to be of log-linear form \beta+{\theta }^{\top}z(u) where z is a spatial covariate function and the focus is on estimating {\theta }. The variational estimator is very simple to implement and quicker than alternative estimation procedures. We establish its strong consistency and asymptotic normality. We also discuss its finite-sample properties in comparison with the maximum first order composite likelihood estimator when considering various inhomogeneous spatial point process models and dimensions as well as settings were z is completely or only partially known.
