Delattre et al. (2013) investigated asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator of the population parameters of the random effects associated with n independent stochastic differential equations (SDEs) assuming that the SDEs are independent and identical (iid).   In this article, we consider the Bayesian approach to learning about the population parameters, and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the corresponding posterior distribution in the iid set-up as well as when the SDEs are independent but non-identical.
