This paper proposes a generalisation of the Pearson type II distribution, which shall termed Pearson Type II-Riesz distribution, based in the Kotz-Riesz distribution. Specifically, the central nonsingular matricvariate generalised Pearson type II-Riesz distribution, beta-Riesz type I distributions and the joint density of the singular values for real normed division algebras are obtained.
