Some units from a population receive the same treatment that is different from treatments available for other reservoir populations. The minimal sufficient statistic s for the pre-treatment x-covariates's distributions in the populations is the coarsest balancing score. s is used to select matching units for simultaneous causal comparisons of multiple treatments.Necessary and sufficient conditions on the posterior distribution of the treatment variable (given x) determine whether a statistic is either sufficient or minimal sufficient for the x-covariates' distributions. Results in the literature are thus extended. Strong ignorability of treatment assignment given s(x) is also established. Consequently, the expected treatments' differences given s(x) are shown to be simultaneously unbiased for the average causal effects of all treatments' differences. The existing statistical theory for s and its estimates support their use in causal inference.
