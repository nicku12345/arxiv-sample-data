We develop singular value shrinkage priors for the mean matrix parameters in the matrix-variate Normal model with known covariance matrices. Introduced priors are superharmonic and put more weight on matrices with smaller singular values. They are a natural generalization of the Stein prior. Bayes estimators and Bayesian predictive densities based on introduced priors are minimax and dominate those based on the uniform prior in finite samples. The risk reduction is large when the true value of the parameter has small singular values. In particular, introduced priors perform stably well in the low rank case. We apply this result to multivariate linear regression problems by considering priors depending on the future samples. Introduced priors are compatible with reduced-rank regression.
