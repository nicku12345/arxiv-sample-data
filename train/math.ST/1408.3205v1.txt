As a type of search design, a detecting array can be used to generate test suites to identify and detect faults caused by interactions of factors in a component-based system. Recently, the construction and optimality of detecting arrays have been investigated in depth in the case where all the factors are assumed to have the same number of levels. However, for real world applications, it is more desirable to use detecting arrays in which the various factors may have different numbers of levels. This paper gives a general criterion to measure the optimality of a mixed level detecting array in terms of its size. Based on this optimality criterion, the combinatorial characteristics of mixed level detecting arrays of optimum size are investigated. This enables us to construct optimum mixed level detecting arrays with a heuristic optimization algorithm and combinatorial methods. As a result, some existence results for optimum mixed level detecting arrays achieving a lower bound are provided for practical use.
