In this paper we have proposed a median based estimator using known value of some population parameter(s) in simple random sampling. Various existing estimators are shown particular members of the proposed estimator. The bias and mean squared error of the proposed estimator is obtained up to the first order of approximation under simple random sampling without replacement. An empirical study is carried out to judge the superiority of proposed estimator over others.
