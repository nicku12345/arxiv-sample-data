In this work we deal with the problem of fitting an error density to the goodness-of-fit test of the errors in nonlinear autoregressive time series models with stationary \alpha-mixing error terms. The test statistic is based on the integrated squared error of the nonparametric error density estimate and the null error density. By deriving the asymptotic normality of test statistics in these models, we extend the result of Cheng and Sun (Statist. Probab. Lett. \textbf{78}, 1(2008), 50-59) in the model with i.i.d error terms to the more general case.
