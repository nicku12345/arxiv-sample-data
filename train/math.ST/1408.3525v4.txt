In a sparse high-dimensional elliptical model we consider a hard threshold estimator for the correlation matrix based on Kendall's tau with threshold level \alpha(\frac{\log p}{n})^{1/2}. Parameters \alpha are identified such that the threshold estimator achieves the minimax rate under the squared Frobenius norm and the squared spectral norm. This allows a reasonable calibration of the estimator without any quantitative information about the tails of the underlying distribution. For Gaussian observations we even establish a critical threshold constant \alpha^\ast under the squared Frobenius norm, i.e. the proposed estimator attains the minimax rate for \alpha>\alpha^\ast but in general not for \alpha<\alpha^\ast. To the best of the author's knowledge this is the first work concerning critical threshold constants. The main ingredient to provide the critical threshold level is a sharp large deviation expansion for Kendall's tau sample correlation evolved from an asymptotic expansion of the number of permutations with a certain number of inversions.   The investigation of this paper also covers further statistical problems like the estimation of the latent correlation matrix in the transelliptical and nonparanormal family.
