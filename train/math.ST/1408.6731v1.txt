Given a sequence of random variables {\bf X}=X_1,X_2,\ldots suppose the aim is to maximize one's return by picking a `favorable' X_i. Obviously, the expected payoff crucially depends on the information at hand. An optimally informed person knows all the values X_i=x_i and thus receives E (\sup X_i). We will compare this return to the expected payoffs of a number of observers having less information, in particular \sup_i (EX_i), the value of the sequence to a person who only knows the first moments of the random variables.   In general, there is a stochastic environment (i.e. a class of random variables \cal C), and several levels of information. Given some {\bf X} \in {\cal C}, an observer possessing information j obtains r_j({\bf X}). We are going to study `information sets' of the form  R_{\cal C}^{j,k} = \{ (x,y) | x = r_j({\bf X}), y=r_k({\bf X}), {\bf X} \in {\cal C} \},  characterizing the advantage of k relative to j. Since such a set measures the additional payoff by virtue of increased information, its analysis yields a number of interesting results, in particular `prophet-type' inequalities.
