In this paper we have suggested difference-type estimator for estimation of population mean of the study variable y in the presence of measurement error using auxiliary information. The optimum estimator in the suggested estimator has been identified along with its mean square error formula. It has been shown that the suggested estimator performs more efficient then other existing estimators. An empirical study is also carried out to illustrate the merits of proposed method over other traditional methods.
