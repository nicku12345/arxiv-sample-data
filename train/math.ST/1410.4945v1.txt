We study an epidemic type change in innovations of a first order autoregressive process  y_{n,k} = \varphi_n y_{n,k-1} + \epsilon_{k} + a_{n,k}, where \phi_n is either a constant in (-1,1) or a sequence in (0,1), converging to 1. For k inside some unknown interval \mathbb{I}_n^\ast=(k^\ast,k^\ast+\ell^\ast], a_{n,k}=a_n while a_{n,k}=0 for k outside \mathbb{I}_n^\ast. When a_n\neq 0, we have an epidemic deviation from the usual (zero) mean of innovations. Since innovations are not observed, we build uniform increments statistics on residuals (\widehat{\epsilon}_k) of the process y_{n,k}. We assume that innovations (\epsilon_k) are regularly varying with index p \ge 2 or satisfies integrability condition \lim_{t \to \infty} t^p P(|\epsilon_1| > t) = 0 for p > 2 and E\epsilon_k^2 < \infty for p=2. We find the limit distributions of the tests under no change and prove consistency under short epidemics that is \ell^\ast=O(n^\beta) for some 0<\beta\le 1/2.
