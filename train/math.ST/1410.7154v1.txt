Let F=F_N be the distribution of a finite real population of size N. Let \widehat{F}=F_N be the empirical distribution of a sample of size n drawn from the population without replacement. We prove the following remarkable {\it inversion principle} for obtaining unbiased estimates. Let  T \left(F_N\right) be any product of the moments or cumulants of F_N. Let T_{n, N} \left( F_N \right) = E T \left( F_n \right). Then E T_{N, n} \left( F_n \right) = T \left( F_N \right). We also obtain an explicit expression for T_{n, N} \left(F_N\right) for all  T \left( F_N \right) of order up to 6.   We also prove the following related result. If F_n and F_N are the sample and population distributions, the only functionals for which E T \left( F_n \right) = \lambda_{n, N} T \left( F_N \right) are noncentral moments, and generalized second and third order central moments. For these three cases the eigenvalues are \lambda_{n, N}=1, \left( 1 - n^{-1} \right) \left( 1 - N^{-1} \right)^{-1}, and \left( 1 - n^{-1} \right) \left( 1 - 2n^{-1} \right) \left( 1 - N^{-1} \right)^{-1} \left( 1 - 2N^{-1} \right)^{-1} respectively.
