We consider repeated measurement designs when a residual or carry-over effect may be present in at most one later period. Since assuming an additive model may be unrealistic for some applications and leads to biased estimation of treatment effects, we consider a model with interactions between carry-over and direct treatment effects. When the aim of the experiment is to study the effects of a treatment used alone, we obtain universally optimal approximate designs. We also propose some efficient designs with a reduced number of subjects.
