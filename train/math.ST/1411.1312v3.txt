We generalize an integral which arises in several areas in probability and statistics and which is at the core of the field of distance correlation, a concept developed by Sz\'ekely, Rizzo and Bakirov (2007) to measure dependence between random variables. Let m be a positive integer and let {\cos_m}(u), u \in \mathbb{R}, be the truncated Maclaurin expansion of {\cos}(u), where the expansion is truncated at the mth summand. For t, x \in \mathbb{R}^d, let \langle t,x\rangle and \|x\| denote the standard Euclidean inner product and norm, respectively. We establish the integral formula: For \alpha \in \mathbb{C} and x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \int_{{\mathbb{R}}^d} [\cos_m(\langle t,x\rangle) - \cos(\langle t,x\rangle)] \,{\rm d}t/{\|t\|^{d+\alpha}} = C(d,\alpha) \, \|x\|^{\alpha}, with absolute convergence if and only if 2(m-1) < \Re(\alpha) < 2m. Moreover, the constant C(d,\alpha) does not depend on m.
