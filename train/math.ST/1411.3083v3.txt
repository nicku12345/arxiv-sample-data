Let \{X_n, n \ge 1\} be a sequence of stationary associated random variables. We discuss another set of conditions under which a central limit theorem for U-statistics based on \{X_n, n \ge 1\} holds. We look at U-statistics based on differentiable kernels of degree 2 and above. We also discuss some applications.
