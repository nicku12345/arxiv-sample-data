We construct and prove the existence of a kernel density estimator on symmetric spaces of non-compact type with minimax convergence rate. Symmetric spaces of non-compact type include hyperboloids of constant curvature -1 and spaces of symmetric positive definite matrices. This paper obtains a simplified formula in the special case when the symmetric space is the space of normal distributions, a 2-dimensional hyperboloid.
