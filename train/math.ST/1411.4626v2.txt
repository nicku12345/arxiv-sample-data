We prove that the convex least squares estimator (LSE) attains a n^{-1/2} pointwise rate of convergence in any region where the truth is linear. In addition, the asymptotic distribution can be characterized by a modified invelope process. Analogous results hold when one uses the derivative of the convex LSE to perform derivative estimation. These asymptotic results facilitate a new consistent testing procedure on the linearity against a convex alternative. Moreover, we show that the convex LSE adapts to the optimal rate at the boundary points of the region where the truth is linear, up to a log-log factor. These conclusions are valid in the context of both density estimation and regression function estimation.
