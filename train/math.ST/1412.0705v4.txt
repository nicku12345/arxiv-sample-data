This paper introduces studies on exponentaited generalized Weibull Gompertz distribution EGWGD which generalizes a lot of distributions. Several properties of the EGWGD such as reversed (hazard) function, moments, maximum likelihood estimation, mean residual (past) lifetime, MTTF, MTTR, MTBF, maintainability, availability and order statistics are studied in this paper. A real data set is analyzed and it is observed that the present distribution can provide a better fit than some other very well known distributions
