As a starting point we prove a functional central limit theorem for estimators of the invariant measure of a geometrically ergodic Harris-recurrent Markov chain in a multi-scale space. This allows to construct confidence bands for the invariant density with optimal (up to undersmoothing) L^{\infty}-diameter by using wavelet projection estimators. In addition our setting applies to the drift estimation of diffusions observed discretely with fixed observation distance. We prove a functional central limit theorem for estimators of the drift function and finally construct adaptive confidence bands for the drift by using a completely data-driven estimator.
