Given a sample from a discretely observed multidimensional compound Poisson process, we study the problem of nonparametric estimation of its jump size density r_0 and intensity \lambda_0. We take a nonparametric Bayesian approach to the problem and determine posterior contraction rates in this context, which, under some assumptions, we argue to be optimal posterior contraction rates. In particular, our results imply the existence of Bayesian point estimates that converge to the true parameter pair (r_0,\lambda_0) at these rates. To the best of our knowledge, construction of nonparametric density estimators for inference in the class of discretely observed multidimensional L\'{e}vy processes, and the study of their rates of convergence is a new contribution to the literature.
