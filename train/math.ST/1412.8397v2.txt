Recently, authors have studied inequalities involving expectations of selected functions viz. failure rate, mean residual life, aging intensity function and log-odds rate which are defined for left truncated random variables in reliability theory to characterize some well-known distributions. However, there has been growing interest in the study of these functions in reversed time and their applications. In the present work we consider reversed hazard rate, expected inactivity time and reversed aging intensity function to deal with right truncated random variables and characterize a few statistical distributions.
