We study a dimensionality reduction technique for finite mixtures of high-dimensional multivariate response regression models. Both the dimension of the response and the number of predictors are allowed to exceed the sample size. We consider predictor selection and rank reduction to obtain lower-dimensional approximations. A class of estimators with a fast rate of convergence is introduced. We apply this result to a specific procedure, introduced in [11], where the relevant predictors are selected by the Group-Lasso.
