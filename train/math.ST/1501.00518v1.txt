In many practical situations exploratory plots are helpful in understanding tail behavior of sample data. The Mean Excess plot is often applied in practice to understand the right tail behavior of a data set. It is known that if the underlying distribution of a data sample is in the domain of attraction of a Frechet, Gumbel or Weibull distributions then the ME plot of the data tend to a straight line in an appropriate sense, with positive, zero or negative slopes respectively. In this paper we construct confidence intervals around the ME plots which assist us in ascertaining which particular maximum domain of attraction the data set comes from. We recall weak limit results for the Frechet domain of attraction, already obtained in Das and Ghosh (2013) and derive weak limits for the Gumbel and Weibull domains in order to construct confidence bounds. We test our methods on both simulated and real data sets.
