In this paper, we introduce a bivariate exponentaited generalized Weibull-Gompertz distribution. The model introduced here is of Marshall-Olkin type. Several properties are studied such as bivariate probability density function and it is marginal, moments, maximum likelihood estimation, joint reversed (hazard) function and joint mean waiting time and it is marginal. A real data set is analyzed and it is observed that the present distribution can provide a better fit than some other very well-known distributions.
