Almost sure convergence rates for linear algorithms h_{k+1} = h_k +\frac{1}{k^\chi} (b_k-A_kh_k) are studied, where \chi\in(0,1), \{A_{k}\}_{k=1}^\infty are symmetric, positive semidefinite random matrices and \{b_{k}\}_{k=1}^\infty are random vectors. It is shown that |h_n- A^{-1}b|=o(n^{-\gamma}) a.s. for the \gamma\in[0,\chi), positive definite A and vector b such that \frac{1}{n^{\chi-\gamma}}\sum\limits_{k=1}^n (A_{k}- A)\to 0 and \frac{1}{n^{\chi-\gamma}}\sum\limits_{k=1}^n (b_k-b)\to 0 a.s. When \chi-\gamma\in\left(\frac12,1\right), these assumptions are implied by the Marcinkiewicz strong law of large numbers, which allows the \{A_k\} and \{b_k\} to have heavy-tails, long-range dependence or both. Finally, corroborating experimental outcomes and decreasing-gain design considerations are provided.
