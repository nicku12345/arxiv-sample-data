The Marcinkiewicz Strong Law, \displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n^{\frac1p}}\sum_{k=1}^n (D_{k}- D)=0 a.s. with p\in(1,2), is studied for outer products D_k=X_k\overline{X}_k^T, where \{X_k\},\{\overline{X}_k\} are both two-sided (multivariate) linear processes ( with coefficient matrices (C_l), (\overline{C}_l) and i.i.d.\ zero-mean innovations \{\Xi\}, \{\overline{\Xi}\}). Matrix sequences C_l and \overline{C}_l can decay slowly enough (as |l|\to\infty) that \{X_k,\overline{X}_k\} have long-range dependence while \{D_k\} can have heavy tails. In particular, the heavy-tail and long-range-dependence phenomena for \{D_k\} are handled simultaneously and a new decoupling property is proved that shows the convergence rate is determined by the worst of the heavy-tails or the long-range dependence, but not the combination. The main result is applied to obtain Marcinkiewicz Strong Law of Large Numbers for stochastic approximation, non-linear functions forms and autocovariances.
