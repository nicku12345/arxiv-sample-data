In this paper, we introduce a new bivariate distribution we called it bivariate expo- nentiated modified Weibull extension distribution (BEMWE). The model introduced here is of Marshall-Olkin type. The marginals of the new bivariate distribution have exponentiated modified Weibull extension distribution which proposed by Sarhan et al.(2013). The joint probability density function and the joint cumulative distribu- tion function are in closed forms. Several properties of this distribution have been discussed.The maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters are derived. One real data set are analyzed using the new bivariate distribution, which show that the new bivariate distribution can be used quite effectively in fitting and analyzing real lifetime data
