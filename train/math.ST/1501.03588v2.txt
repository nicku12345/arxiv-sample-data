In this paper, we seek to establish asymptotic results for selective inference procedures removing the assumption of Gaussianity. The class of selection procedures we consider are determined by affine inequalities, which we refer to as affine selection procedures. Examples of affine selection procedures include post-selection inference along the solution path of the LASSO, as well as post-selection inference after fitting the LASSO at a fixed value of the regularization parameter. We also consider some tests in penalized generalized linear models. Our method of proof adapts a method of Chatterjee (2005).
