The use of second order boundary kernels for distribution function estimation was recently addressed in the literature (C. Tenreiro, 2013, Boundary kernels for distribution function estimation, REVSTAT-Statistical Journal, 11, 169-190). In this note we return to the subject by considering an enlarged class of boundary kernels that shows it self to be especially performing when the classical kernel distribution function estimator suffers from severe boundary problems.
