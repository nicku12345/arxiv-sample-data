A new discrete distribution has been proposed as a discrete analogue of the two sided power distribution [Van Drop, J. R. and Kotz, S. (2002a). A novel extension of the triangular distribution and its parameter estimation, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series D (The Statistician), 51, 1: 63-79]. This probability mass function and hazard rate function of this distribution can assume a variety of shapes including bath tub, rectangular, trapezoidal, triangular, J, inverse J, U inverse U, strictly decreasing and strictly increasing shapes. Its moment and reliability properties along with parameter estimation have been investigated.
