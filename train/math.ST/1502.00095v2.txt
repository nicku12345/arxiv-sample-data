We discuss a class of conditionally heteroscedastic time series models satisfying the equation r_t= \zeta_t \sigma_t, where \zeta_t are standardized i.i.d. r.v.'s and the conditional standard deviation \sigma_t is a nonlinear function Q of inhomogeneous linear combination of past values r_s, s<t with coefficients b_j. The existence of stationary solution r_t with finite pth moment, 0< p < \infty  is obtained under some conditions on Q, b_j and pth moment of \zeta_0. Weak dependence properties of r_t are studied, including the invariance principle for partial sums of Lipschitz functions of r_t. In the case of quadratic Q^2, we prove that r_t can exhibit a leverage effect and long memory, in the sense that the squared process r^2_t has long memory autocorrelation and its normalized partial sums process converges to a fractional Brownian motion.
