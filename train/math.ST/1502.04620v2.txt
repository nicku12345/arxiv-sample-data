Using properties of shuffles of copulas and tools from combinatorics we solve the open question about the exact region \Omega determined by all possible values of Kendall's \tau and Spearman's \rho. In particular, we prove that the well-known inequality established by Durbin and Stuart in 1951 is only sharp on a countable set with sole accumulation point (-1,-1), give a simple analytic characterization of \Omega in terms of a continuous, strictly increasing piecewise concave function, and show that \Omega is compact and simply connected but not convex. The results also show that for each (x,y)\in \Omega there are mutually completely dependent random variables whose \tau and \rho values coincide with x and y respectively.
