In this paper the asymptotic behavior of the conditional least squares estimators of the offspring mean matrix for a 2-type critical positively regular Galton-Watson branching process with immigration is described.We also study this question for a natural estimator of the spectral radius of the offspring mean matrix, which we call criticality parameter. We discuss the subcritical case as well.
