Let X_1, X_2,\ldots, X_n be n independent and identically distributed random variables, here n \geq 2. Let X_{(1)}, X_{(2)}, \ldots, X_{(n)} be the order statistics of X_1, X_2,..., X_n. In this note we proved that: (I) If X_1, X_2,..., X_n are exponential random variables with parameter c > 0, then the "correlation coefficient" between X_{(k)} and X_{(k+t)} is strictly increasing in k from 1 to m, and then is strictly decreasing in k from m to n - t, here t is a fixed integer between 1 and n - 3, and m = (n - t)/2 if n - t is even, m = (n - t + 1)/2 if n - t is odd. We also proved that if t = n - 2, then the "correlation coefficient" between X_{(1)} and X_{(n-1)} is greater than the "correlation coefficient" between X_{(2)} andX_{(n)}. (II) The "correlation coefficient" between X_{(k)} and X_{(k+t)} for the exponential random variables is always less than the "correlation coefficient" between X_{(k)} and X_{(k+t)} for the uniform random variables for all k and t such that k + t \leq n. A combinatorial identity is also given as a bi-product. \vs
