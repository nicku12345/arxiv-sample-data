In sample survey, when data is collected, it is assumed that whatever is reported by respondent is correct. However, given the issues of prestige bias, personal respect, respondents self reported data often produces over-or-under estimated values from true value. This causes measurement error to be present in sample values. In support of this study, we have considered some precise classes using dual under measurement error model. The expressions for the bias and the mean square errors of proposed classes have been derived and compared with, the mean per unit estimator, the Srivenkataramana 1980 estimator and Sharma and Tailor 2010 estimator.
