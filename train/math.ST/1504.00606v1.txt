The aim of this paper is to establish rates of convergence to Gaussianity for wavelet coefficients on circular Poisson random fields. This result is established by using the Stein-Malliavin techniques introduced by Peccati and Zheng (2011) and the concentration properties of so-called Mexican needlets on the circle
