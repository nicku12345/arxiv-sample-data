Let \sigma,t\in{\mathbb{R}}, s=\sigma+\mathrm{{i}}t, \Gamma (s) be the Gamma function, \zeta(s) be the Riemann zeta function and \xi(s):=s(s-1)\pi ^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)\zeta(s) be the complete Riemann zeta function. We show that \Xi_{\sigma}(t):=\xi (\sigma-\mathrm{{i}}t)/\xi(\sigma) is a characteristic function for any \sigma\in{\mathbb{R}} by giving the probability density function. Next we prove that the Riemann hypothesis is true if and only if each \Xi_{\sigma}(t) is a pretended-infinitely divisible characteristic function, which is defined in this paper, for each 1/2<\sigma<1. Moreover, we show that \Xi_{\sigma}(t) is a pretended-infinitely divisible characteristic function when \sigma=1. Finally we prove that the characteristic function \Xi_{\sigma}(t) is not infinitely divisible but quasi-infinitely divisible for any \sigma>1.
