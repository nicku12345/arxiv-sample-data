The extremal coefficient function (ECF) of a max-stable process X on some index set T assigns to each finite subset A\subset T the effective number of independent random variables among the collection \{X_t\}_{t\in A}. We introduce the class of Tawn-Molchanov processes that is in a 1:1 correspondence with the class of ECFs, thus also proving a complete characterization of the ECF in terms of negative definiteness. The corresponding Tawn-Molchanov process turns out to be exceptional among all max-stable processes sharing the same ECF in that its dependency set is maximal w.r.t. inclusion. This entails sharp lower bounds for the finite dimensional distributions of arbitrary max-stable processes in terms of its ECF. A spectral representation of the Tawn-Molchanov process and stochastic continuity are discussed. We also show how to build new valid ECFs from given ECFs by means of Bernstein functions.
