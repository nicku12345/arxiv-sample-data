A new approach to detect change points based on differential smoothing and multiple testing is presented for long data sequences modeled as piecewise constant functions plus stationary ergodic Gaussian noise. As an application of the STEM algorithm for peak detection developed in \citet{schwartzman2011multiple} and \citet{cheng2017multiple}, the method detects change points as significant local maxima and minima after smoothing and differentiating the observed sequence. The algorithm, combined with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for thresholding p-values, provides asymptotic strong control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and power consistency, as the length of the sequence and the size of the jumps get large. Simulations show that FDR levels are maintained in non-asymptotic conditions and guide the choice of smoothing bandwidth. The methods are illustrated in magnetometer sensor data and genomic array-CGH data. An R package named "dSTEM" is available in R cran.
