Let X,X_1,\dots, X_n be i.i.d. Gaussian random variables in a separable Hilbert space {\mathbb H} with zero mean and covariance operator \Sigma={\mathbb E}(X\otimes X), and let \hat \Sigma:=n^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^n (X_j\otimes X_j) be the sample (empirical) covariance operator based on (X_1,\dots, X_n). Denote by P_r the spectral projector of \Sigma corresponding to its r-th eigenvalue \mu_r and by \hat P_r the empirical counterpart of P_r. The main goal of the paper is to obtain tight bounds on  \sup_{x\in {\mathbb R}} \left|{\mathbb P}\left\{\frac{\|\hat P_r-P_r\|_2^2-{\mathbb E}\|\hat P_r-P_r\|_2^2}{{\rm Var}^{1/2}(\|\hat P_r-P_r\|_2^2)}\leq x\right\}-\Phi(x)\right|,  where \|\cdot\|_2 denotes the Hilbert--Schmidt norm and \Phi is the standard normal distribution function. Such accuracy of normal approximation of the distribution of squared Hilbert--Schmidt error is characterized in terms of so called effective rank of \Sigma defined as {\bf r}(\Sigma)=\frac{{\rm tr}(\Sigma)}{\|\Sigma\|_{\infty}}, where {\rm tr}(\Sigma) is the trace of \Sigma and \|\Sigma\|_{\infty} is its operator norm, as well as another parameter characterizing the size of {\rm Var}(\|\hat P_r-P_r\|_2^2). Other results include non-asymptotic bounds and asymptotic representations for the mean squared Hilbert--Schmidt norm error {\mathbb E}\|\hat P_r-P_r\|_2^2 and the variance {\rm Var}(\|\hat P_r-P_r\|_2^2), and concentration inequalities for \|\hat P_r-P_r\|_2^2 around its expectation.
