In this paper we derive an online estimator for sparse parameter vectors which, unlike the LASSO approach, does not require the tuning of any hyperparameters. The algorithm is based on a covariance matching approach and is equivalent to a weighted version of the square-root LASSO. The computational complexity of the estimator is of the same order as that of the online versions of regularized least-squares (RLS) and LASSO. We provide a numerical comparison with feasible and infeasible implementations of the LASSO and RLS to illustrate the advantage of the proposed online hyperparameter-free estimator.
