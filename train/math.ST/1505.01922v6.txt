We consider high frequency samples from ergodic L\'evy driven stochastic differential equation (SDE) with drift coefficient a(x,\alpha) and scale coefficient c(x,\gamma) involving unknown parameters \alpha and \gamma. We suppose that the L\'evy measure \nu_{0}, has all order moments but is not fully specified. We will prove the joint asymptotic normality of some estimators of \alpha, \gamma and a class of functional parameter \int\varphi(z)\nu_0(dz), which are constructed in a two-step manner: first, we use the Gaussian quasi-likelihood for estimation of (\alpha,\gamma), and then, for estimating \int\varphi(z)\nu_0(dz) we makes use of the method of moments based on the Euler-type residual with the the previously obtained quasi-likelihood estimator.
