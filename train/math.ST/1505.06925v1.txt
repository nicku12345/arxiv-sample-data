Recently, authors have studied weighted version of Kerridge inaccuracy measure for truncated distributions. In the present communication we introduce the notion of weighted interval inaccuracy measure for two-sided truncated random variables. In reliability theory and survival analysis, this measure may help to study the various characteristics of a system/component when it fails between two time points. Various aspects of weighted interval inaccuracy measure have been discussed and some characterization results have been provided. This new measure is a generalization of recent dynamic weighted inaccuracy measure.
