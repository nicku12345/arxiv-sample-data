Exact-sparsity inducing prior distributions in Bayesian analysis typically lead to posterior distributions that are very challenging to handle by standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, particular in high-dimensional models with large number of parameters. We propose a methodology to derive smooth approximations of such posterior distributions that are, in some cases, easier to handle by standard MCMC methods. The approximation is obtained from the forward-backward approximation of the Moreau-Yosida regularization of the negative log-density. We show that the derived approximation is within O(\sqrt{\gamma}) of the true posterior distribution in the \beta-metric, where \gamma>0 is a user-controlled parameter that defines the approximation. We illustrate the method with a high-dimensional linear regression model.
