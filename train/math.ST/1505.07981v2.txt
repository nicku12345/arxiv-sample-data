In this paper we consider the behavior of Kalman Filter state estimates in the case of distribution with heavy tails .The simulated linear state space models with Gaussian measurement noises were used. Gaussian noises in state equation are replaced by components with alpha-stable distribution with di erent parameters alpha and beta. We consider the case when "all parameters are known" and two methods of parameters estimation are compared: the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the expectation- maximization algorithm (EM). It was shown that in cases of large deviation from Gaussian distribution the total error of states estimation rises dramatically. We conjecture that it can be explained by underestimation of the state equation noises covariance matrix that can be taken into account through the EM parameters estimation and ignored in the case of ML estimation.
