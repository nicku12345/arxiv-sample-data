Let X=\{X(t),t\in\mathrm{R}^N\} be a centered real-valued operator-scaling Gaussian random field with stationary increments, introduced by Bierm\'{e}, Meerschaert and Scheffler (Stochastic Process. Appl. 117 (2007) 312-332). We prove that X satisfies a form of strong local nondeterminism and establish its exact uniform and local moduli of continuity. The main results are expressed in terms of the quasi-metric \tau_E associated with the scaling exponent of X. Examples are provided to illustrate the subtle changes of the regularity properties.
