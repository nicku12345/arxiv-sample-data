We study subsampling estimators for the limit variance \[   \sigma^2=Var(X_1)+2 \sum_{k=2}^\infty Cov(X_1,X_k) \] of partial sums of a stationary stochastic process (X_k)_{k\geq 1}. We establish L_2-consistency of a non-overlapping block resampling method. Our results apply to processes that can be represented as functionals of strongly mixing processes. Motivated by recent applications to rank tests, we also study estimators for the series Var(F(X_1))+2 \sum_{k=2}^\infty Cov(F(X_1),F(X_k)), where F is the distribution function of X_1. Simulations illustrate the usefulness of the proposed estimators and of a mean squared error optimal rule for the choice of the block length.
