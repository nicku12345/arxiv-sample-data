This paper addresses the problem of estimating the extreme value index in presence of random censoring for distributions in the Weibull domain of attraction. The methodologies introduced in [Worms (2014)], in the heavy-tailed case, are adapted here to the negative extreme value index framework, leading to the definition of weighted versions of the popular moments of relative excesses with arbitrary exponent. This leads to the definition of two families of estimators (with an adaptation of the so called Moment estimator as a particular case), for which the consistency is proved under a first order condition. Illustration of their performance, issued from an extensive simulation study, are provided.
