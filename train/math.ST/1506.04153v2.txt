In this paper, based on the Fr{\'e}chet mean, we define a notion of barycenter corresponding to a usual notion of statistical mean. We prove the existence of Wasserstein barycenters of random distributions defined on a geodesic space (E, d). We also prove the consistency of this barycenter in a general setting, that includes taking barycenters of empirical versions of the distributions or of a growing set of distributions.
