In this paper we estimate both the Hurst and the stable indices of a H-self-similar stable process. More precisely, let X be a H-sssi (self-similar stationary increments) symmetric \alpha-stable process. The process X is observed at points \frac{k}{n}, k=0,\ldots,n. Our estimate is based on \beta-variations with -\frac{1}{2}<\beta<0. We obtain consistent estimators, with rate of convergence, for several classical H-sssi \alpha-stable processes (fractional Brownian motion, well-balanced linear fractional stable motion, Takenaka's processes, L\'evy motion). Moreover, we obtain asymptotic normality of our estimators for fractional Brownian motion and L\'evy motion.   Keywords: H-sssi processes; stable processes; self-similarity parameter estimator; stability parameter estimator.
