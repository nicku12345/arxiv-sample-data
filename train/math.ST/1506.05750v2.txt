An estimator for the \M-index of functions of \mathcal{M}, a larger class than the class of regularly varying (RV) functions, is proposed. This index is the tail index of RV functions and this estimator is thus a new one on the class of RV functions. This estimator satisfies, assuming suitable conditions, strong consistency. Asymptotic normality of this estimator is proved for a large class of RV functions, showing a better performance than some well-known estimators. Illustrations with simulated and real life datasets are provided.
