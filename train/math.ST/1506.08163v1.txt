We study the estimation error of constrained M-estimators, and derive explicit upper bounds on the expected estimation error determined by the Gaussian width of the constraint set. Both of the cases where the true parameter is on the boundary of the constraint set (matched constraint), and where the true parameter is strictly in the constraint set (mismatched constraint) are considered. For both cases, we derive novel universal estimation error bounds for regression in a generalized linear model with the canonical link function. Our error bound for the mismatched constraint case is minimax optimal in terms of its dependence on the sample size, for Gaussian linear regression by the Lasso.
