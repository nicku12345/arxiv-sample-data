Establishing the convergence of splines can be cast as a variational problem which is amenable to a \Gamma-convergence approach. We consider the case in which the regularization coefficient scales with the number of observations, n, as \lambda_n=n^{-p}. Using standard theorems from the \Gamma-convergence literature, we prove that the general spline model is consistent in that estimators converge in a sense slightly weaker than weak convergence in probability for p\leq \frac{1}{2}. Without further assumptions we show this rate is sharp. This differs from rates for strong convergence using Hilbert scales where one can often choose p>\frac{1}{2}.
