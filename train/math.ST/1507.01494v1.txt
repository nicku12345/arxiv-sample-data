We investigate the problems of drift estimation for a shifted Brownian motion and intensity estimation for a Cox process on a finite interval [0,T], when the risk is given by the energy functional associated to some fractional Sobolev space H^1_0\subset W^{\alpha,2}\subset L^2. In both situations, Cramer-Rao lower bounds are obtained, entailing in particular that no unbiased estimators with finite risk in H^1_0 exist. By Malliavin calculus techniques, we also study super-efficient Stein type estimators (in the Gaussian case).
