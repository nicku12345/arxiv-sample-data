We propose methodology for estimation of sparse precision matrices and statistical inference for their low-dimensional parameters in a high-dimensional setting where the number of parameters p can be much larger than the sample size. We show that the novel estimator achieves minimax rates in supremum norm and the low-dimensional components of the estimator have a Gaussian limiting distribution. These results hold uniformly over the class of precision matrices with row sparsity of small order \sqrt{n}/\log p and spectrum uniformly bounded, under a sub-Gaussian tail assumption on the margins of the true underlying distribution. Consequently, our results lead to uniformly valid confidence regions for low-dimensional parameters of the precision matrix. Thresholding the estimator leads to variable selection without imposing irrepresentability conditions. The performance of the method is demonstrated in a simulation study and on real data.
