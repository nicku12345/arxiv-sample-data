The central limit theorem introduced by Stute [The central limit theorem under random censorship. Ann. Statist. 1995; 23: 422-439] does not hold for some class of heavy-tailed distributions. In this paper, we make use of the extreme value theory to propose an alternative estimating approach of the mean ensuring the asymptotic normality property. A simulation study is carried out to evaluate the performance of this estimation procedure
