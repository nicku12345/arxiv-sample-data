This work deals with the estimation of the extreme value index and extreme quantiles for heavy tailed data,randomly right truncated by another heavy tailed variable. Under mild assumptions and the condition thatthe truncated variable is less heavy-tailed than the truncating variable, asymptotic normality is proved for bothestimators. The proposed estimator of the extreme value index is an adaptation of the Hill estimator, in thenatural form of a Lynden-Bell integral. Simulations illustrate the quality of the estimators under a variety ofsituations.
