We study the rates of estimation of finite mixing distributions, that is, the parameters of the mixture. We prove that under some regularity and strong identifiability conditions, around a given mixing distribution with m_0 components, the optimal local minimax rate of estimation of a mixing distribution with m components is n^{-1/(4(m-m_0) + 2)}. This corrects a previous paper by Chen (1995) in The Annals of Statistics.   By contrast, it turns out that there are estimators with a (non-uniform) pointwise rate of estimation of n^{-1/2} for all mixing distributions with a finite number of components.
