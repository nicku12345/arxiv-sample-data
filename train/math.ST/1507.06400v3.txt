In this paper we propose a new lifetime model, called the odd generalized exponential gompertz distribution, We obtain some of its mathematical properties. Some structural properties of the new distribution are studied. The method of maximum likelihood method is used for estimating the model parameters and the observed Fisher's information matrix is derived. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model by applications to real data.
