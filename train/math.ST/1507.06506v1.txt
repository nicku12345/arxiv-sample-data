Stationary determinantal point processes are proved to be Brillinger mixing. This property is an important step towards asymptotic statistics for these processes. As an important example, a central limit theorem for a wide class of functionals of determinantal point processes is established. This result yields in particular the asymptotic normality of the estimator of the intensity of a stationary determinantal point process and of the kernel estimator of its pair correlation.
