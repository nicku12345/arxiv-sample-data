The asymptotic normality of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) is a cornerstone of statistical theory. In the present paper, we provide sharp explicit upper bounds on Zolotarev-type distances between the exact, unknown distribution of the MLE and its limiting normal distribution. Our approach to this fundamental issue is based on a sound combination of the Delta method, Stein's method, Taylor expansions and conditional expectations, for the classical situations where the MLE can be expressed as a function of a sum of independent and identically distributed terms. This encompasses in particular the broad exponential family of distributions.
