Dixit and Jabbari Nooghabi (2010) had derived the MLE and UMVUE of the probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distributive function (cdf). Further, it had been shown that MLE is more efficient than UMVUE. He, Zhou and Zhang (2014) have also derived the same and made a remark that the work of Dixit and Jabbari Nooghabi (2010) is not correct. We have made a comments with detail algebra that our results are correct. Further, we have also given the R code.
