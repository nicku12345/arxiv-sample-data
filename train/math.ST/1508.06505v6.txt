We propose and analyze an algorithm for the sequential estimation of a conditional quantile in the context of real stochastic codes with vectorvalued inputs. Our algorithm is based on k-nearest neighbors smoothing within a Robbins-Monro estimator. We discuss the convergence of the algorithm under some conditions on the stochastic code. We provide non-asymptotic rates of convergence of the mean squared error and we discuss the tuning of the algorithm's parameters.
