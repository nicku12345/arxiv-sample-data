We study the contraction properties of a quasi-posterior distribution \check\Pi_{n,d} obtained by combining a quasi-likelihood function and a sparsity inducing prior distribution on \rset^d, as both n (the sample size), and d (the dimension of the parameter) increase. We derive some general results that highlight a set of sufficient conditions under which \check\Pi_{n,d} puts increasingly high probability on sparse subsets of \rset^d, and contracts towards the true value of the parameter. We apply these results to the analysis of logistic regression models, and binary graphical models, in high-dimensional settings. For the logistic regression model, we shows that for well-behaved design matrices, the posterior distribution contracts at the rate O(\sqrt{s_\star\log(d)/n}), where s_\star is the number of non-zero components of the parameter. For the binary graphical model, under some regularity conditions, we show that a quasi-posterior analog of the neighborhood selection of \cite{meinshausen06} contracts in the Frobenius norm at the rate O(\sqrt{(p+S)\log(p)/n}), where p is the number of nodes, and S the number of edges of the true graph.
