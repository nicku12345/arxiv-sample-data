We study the existence and properties of stationary solution of ARCH-type equation r_t= \zeta_t \sigma_t, where \zeta_t are standardized i.i.d. r.v.'s and the conditional variance satisfies an AR(1) equation \sigma^2_t = Q^2\big(a + \sum_{j=1}^\infty b_j r_{t-j}\big) + \gamma \sigma^2_{t-1} with a Lipschitz function Q(x) and real parameters a, \gamma, b_j . The paper extends the model and the results in Doukhan et al. (2015) from the case \gamma = 0 to the case 0< \gamma < 1. We also obtain a new condition for the existence of higher moments of r_t which does not include the Rosenthal constant. In particular case when Q is the square root of a quadratic polynomial, we prove that r_t can exhibit a leverage effect and long memory. We also present simulated trajectories and histograms of marginal density of \sigma_t for different values of \gamma.
