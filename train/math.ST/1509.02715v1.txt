The problem of parameter estimation by the continuous time observations of a deterministic signal in white gaussian noise is considered. The asymptotic properties of the maximul likelihood estimator are described in the asymptotics of small noise (large siglal-to-noise ratio). We are interested by the situation when there is a misspecification in the regularity conditions. In particular it is supposed that the statistician uses a discontinuous (change-point type) model of signal, when the true signal is continuously differentiable function of the unknown parameter.
