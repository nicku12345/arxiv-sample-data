This paper deals with the construction of a metamodel (i.e. a simplified mathematical model) for a stochastic computer code (also called stochastic numerical model or stochastic simulator), where stochastic means that the code maps the realization of a random variable. The goal is to get, for a given model input, the main information about the output probability distribution by using this metamodel and without running the computer code. In practical applications, such a metamodel enables one to have estimations of every possible random variable properties, such as the expectation, the probability of exceeding a threshold or any quantile. The present work is concentrated on the emulation of the quantile function of the stochastic simulator by interpolating well chosen basis function and metamodeling their coefficients (using the Gaussian process metamodel). This quantile function metamodel is then used to treat a simple optimization strategy maintenance problem using a stochastic code, in order to optimize the quantile of an economic indicator. Using the Gaussian process framework, an adaptive design method (called QFEI) is defined by extending in our case the well known EGO algorithm. This allows to obtain an "optimal" solution using a small number of simulator runs.
