We discuss parametric quasi-maximum likelihood estimation for quadratic ARCH process with long memory introduced in Doukhan et al. (2015) and Grublyt\.e and \v{S}karnulis (2015) with conditional variance given by a strictly positive quadratic form of observable stationary sequence. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the corresponding QMLE estimates, including the estimate of long memory parameter 0< d < 1/2. A simulation study of empirical MSE is included.
