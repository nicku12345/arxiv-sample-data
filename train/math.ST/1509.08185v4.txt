Basic principles of statistical inference are commonly violated in network data analysis. Under the current approach, it is often impossible to identify a model that accommodates known empirical behaviors, possesses crucial inferential properties, and accurately models the data generating process. In the absence of one or more of these properties, sensible inference from network data cannot be assured.   Our proposed framework decomposes every network model into a (relatively) exchangeable data generating process} and a sampling mechanism that relates observed data to the population network. This framework, which encompasses all models in current use as well as many new models, such as edge exchangeable and relationally exchangeable models, that lie outside the existing paradigm, offers a sound context within which to develop theory and methods for network analysis.
