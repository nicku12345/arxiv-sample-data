Consider the following dynamic factor model: \mathbf{R}_t=\sum_{i=0}^q \mathbf{\Lambda}_i \mathbf{f}_{t-i}+\mathbf{e}_t,t=1,...,T, where \mathbf{\Lambda}_i is an n\times k loading matrix of full rank, \{\mathbf{f}_t\} are i.i.d. k\times1-factors, and \mathbf{e}_t are independent n\times1 white noises. Now, assuming that n/T\to c>0, we want to estimate the orders k and q respectively. Define a random matrix \mathbf{\Phi}_n(\tau)=\frac{1}{2T}\sum_{j=1}^T (\mathbf{R}_j \mathbf{R}_{j+\tau}^* + \mathbf{R}_{j+\tau} \mathbf{R}_j^*), where \tau\ge 0 is an integer. When there are no factors, the matrix \Phi_{n}(\tau) reduces to \mathbf{M}_n(\tau) = \frac{1}{2T} \sum_{j=1}^T (\mathbf{e}_j \mathbf{e}_{j+\tau}^* + \mathbf{e}_{j+\tau} \mathbf{e}_j^*). When \tau=0, \mathbf{M}_n(\tau) reduces to the usual sample covariance matrix whose ESD tends to the well known MP law and \mathbf{\Phi}_n(0) reduces to the standard spike model. Hence the number k(q+1) can be estimated by the number of spiked eigenvalues of \mathbf{\Phi}_n(0). To obtain separate estimates of k and q , we have employed the spectral analysis of \mathbf{M}_n(\tau) and established the spiked model analysis for \mathbf{\Phi}_n(\tau).
