In the renewal processes, if the waiting time probability density function is a tempered power-law distribution, then the process displays a transition dynamics; and the transition time depends on the parameter \lambda of the exponential cutoff. In this paper, we discuss the aging effects of the renewal process with the tempered power-law waiting time distribution. By using the aging renewal theory, the p-th moment of the number of renewal events n_a(t_a, t) in the interval (t_a, t_a+t) is obtained for both the weakly and strongly aged systems; and the corresponding surviving probabilities are also investigated. We then further analyze the tempered aging continuous time random walk and its Einstein relation, and the mean square displacement is attained. Moreover, the tempered aging diffusion equation is derived.
