The use of non parametric hidden Markov models with finite state space is flourishing in practice while few theoretical guarantees are known in this framework. Here, we study asymptotic guarantees for these models in the Bayesian framework. We obtain posterior concentration rates with respect to the L_1-norm on joint marginal densities of consecutive observations in a general theorem. We apply this theorem to two cases and obtain minimax concentration rates. We consider discrete observations with emission distributions distributed from a Dirichlet process and continuous observations with emission distributions distributed from Dirichlet process mixtures of Gaussian distributions.
