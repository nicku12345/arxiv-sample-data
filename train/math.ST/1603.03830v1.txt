This paper is to prove the asymptotic normality of a statistic for detecting the existence of heteroscedasticity for linear regression models without assuming randomness of covariates when the sample size n tends to infinity and the number of covariates p is either fixed or tends to infinity. Moreover our approach indicates that its asymptotic normality holds even without homoscedasticity.
