In the framework of an abstract statistical model we discuss how to use the solution of one estimation problem ({\it Problem A}) in order to construct an estimator in another, completely different, {\it Problem B}. As a solution of {\it Problem A} we understand a data-driven selection from a given family of estimators \mathbf{A}(\mH)=\big\{\widehat{A}_\mh, \mh\in\mH\big\} and establishing for the selected estimator so-called oracle inequality. %parameterized by some se t\mH. If \hat{\mh}\in\mH is the selected parameter and \mathbf{B}(\mH)=\big\{\widehat{B}_\mh, \mh\in\mH\big\} is an estimator's collection built in {\it Problem B} we suggest to use the estimator \widehat{B}_{\hat{\mh}}. We present very general selection rule led to selector \hat{\mh} and find conditions under which the estimator \widehat{B}_{\hat{\mh}} is reasonable. Our approach is illustrated by several examples related to adaptive estimation.
