The problem of drift estimation for the solution X of a stochastic differential equation with L\'evy-type jumps is considered under discrete high-frequency observations with a growing observation window. An efficient and asymptotically normal estimator for the drift parameter is constructed under minimal conditions on the jump behavior and the sampling scheme. In the case of a bounded jump measure density these conditions reduce to n \Delta_n^{3-\epsilon}\to 0, where n is the number of observations and \Delta_n is the maximal sampling step. This result relaxes the condition n\Delta_n^2 \to 0 usually required for joint estimation of drift and diffusion coefficient for SDE's with jumps. The main challenge in this estimation problem stems from the appearance of the unobserved continuous part X^c in the likelihood function. In order to construct the drift estimator we recover this continuous part from discrete observations. More precisely, we estimate, in a nonparametric way, stochastic integrals with respect to X^c. Convergence results of independent interest are proved for these nonparametric estimators. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of our drift estimator for a number of popular L\'evy-driven models from finance.
