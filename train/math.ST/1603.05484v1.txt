Coupling by reflection mixed with synchronous coupling is constructed for a class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by L\'{e}vy noises. As an application, we establish the exponential contractivity of the associated semigroups (P_t)_{t\ge0} with respect to the standard L^p-Wasserstein distance for all p\in[1,\infty). In particular, consider the following SDE: \[\mathrm{d}X_t=\mathrm{d}Z_t+b(X_t)\,\mathrm{d}t,\] where (Z_t)_{t\ge0} is a symmetric \alpha-stable process on \mathbb{R}^d with \alpha\in(1,2). We show that if the drift term b satisfies that for any x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d, \[\bigl\langle b(x)-b(y),x-y\bigr\rangle\le\cases{K_1|x-y|^2,\qquad |x-y|\le L_0;\cr -K_2|x-y|^{\theta},\qquad |x-y|>L_0}\] holds with some positive constants K_1, K_2, L_0>0 and \theta\ge2, then there is a constant \lambda:=\lambda(\theta,K_1,K_2,L_0)>0 such that for all p\in[1,\infty), t>0 and x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d, \[W_p(\delta_xP_t,\delta_yP_t)\le C(p,\theta,K_1,K_2,L_0)\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda t/p}\biggl[\frac{|x-y|^{1/p}\vee|x-y|}{1+|x-y|{\mathbf{1}}_{(1,\infty )\times (2,\infty)}(t,\theta)}\biggr].\]
