We study Cauchy-distributed difference priors for edge-preserving Bayesian statistical inverse problems. On the contrary to the well-known total variation priors, one-dimensional Cauchy priors are non-Gaussian priors also in the discretization limit. Cauchy priors have independent and identically distributed increments. One-dimensional Cauchy and Gaussian random walks are special cases of L\'evy \alpha-stable random walks with \alpha=1 and \alpha=2, respectively. Both random walks can be written in closed-form, and as priors, they provide smoothing and edge-preserving properties. We briefly discuss also continuous and discrete L\'evy \alpha-stable random walks, and generalize the methodology to two-dimensional priors.   We apply the developed algorithm to one-dimensional deconvolution and two-dimensional X-ray tomography problems. We compute conditional mean estimates with single-component Metropolis-Hastings and maximum a posteriori estimates with Gauss-Newton-type optimization method. We compare the proposed tomography reconstruction method to filtered back-projection estimate and conditional mean estimates with Gaussian and total variation priors.
