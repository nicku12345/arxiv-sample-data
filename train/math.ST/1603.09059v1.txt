We consider maximum likelihood estimation with data from a bivariate Gaussian process with a separable exponential covariance model under fixed domain asymptotic. We first characterize the equivalence of Gaussian measures under this model. Then consistency and asymptotic distribution for the microergodic parameters are established. A simulation study is presented in order to compare the finite sample behavior of the maximum likelihood estimator with the given asymptotic distribution.
