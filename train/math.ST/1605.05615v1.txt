This article is concerned with proving the consistency of Efron's (1981) bootstrap for the Kaplan-Meier estimator on the whole support of a survival function. While other works address the asymptotic Gaussianity of the estimator itself without restricting time (e.g. Gill, 1983, and Ying, 1989), we enable the construction of bootstrap-based time-simultaneous confidence bands for the whole survival function. Other practical applications include bootstrap-based confidence bands for the mean residual life-time function or the Lorenz curve as well as confidence intervals for the Gini index.
