This paper is devoted to study a new three- parameters model called the Exponential Flexible Weibull extension (EFWE) distribution which exhibits bathtub-shaped hazard rate. Some of it's statistical properties are obtained including ordinary and incomplete moments, quantile and generating functions, reliability and order statistics. The method of maximum likelihood is used for estimating the model parameters and the observed Fisher's information matrix is derived. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model by applications to real data.
