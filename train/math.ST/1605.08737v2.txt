In this paper, we study the estimation of partially linear models for spatial data distributed over complex domains. We use bivariate splines over triangulations to represent the nonparametric component on an irregular two-dimensional domain. The proposed method is formulated as a constrained minimization problem which does not require constructing finite elements or locally supported basis functions. Thus, it allows an easier implementation of piecewise polynomial representations of various degrees and various smoothness over an arbitrary triangulation. Moreover, the constrained minimization problem is converted into an unconstrained minimization via a QR decomposition of the smoothness constraints, which leads to a penalized least squares method to estimate the model. The estimators of the parameters are proved to be asymptotically normal under some regularity conditions. The estimator of the bivariate function is consistent, and its rate of convergence is also established. The proposed method enables us to construct confidence intervals and permits inference for the parameters. The performance of the estimators is evaluated by two simulation examples and by a real data analysis.
