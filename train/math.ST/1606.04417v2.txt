Let \bbZ_{M_1\times N}=\bbT^{\frac{1}{2}}\bbX where (\bbT^{\frac{1}{2}})^2=\bbT is a positive definite matrix and \bbX consists of independent random variables with mean zero and variance one. This paper proposes a unified matrix model \bold{\bbom}=(\bbZ\bbU_2\bbU_2^T\bbZ^T)^{-1}\bbZ\bbU_1\bbU_1^T\bbZ^T, where \bbU_1 and \bbU_2 are isometric with dimensions N\times N_1 and N\times (N-N_2) respectively such that \bbU_1^T\bbU_1=\bbI_{N_1}, \bbU_2^T\bbU_2=\bbI_{N-N_2} and \bbU_1^T\bbU_2=0. Moreover, \bbU_1 and \bbU_2 (random or non-random) are independent of \bbZ_{M_1\times N} and with probability tending to one, rank(\bbU_1)=N_1 and rank(\bbU_2)=N-N_2.   We establish the asymptotic Tracy-Widom distribution for its largest eigenvalue under moment assumptions on \bbX when N_1,N_2 and M_1 are comparable.   By selecting appropriate matrices \bbU_1 and \bbU_2, the asymptotic distributions of the maximum eigenvalues of the matrices used in Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and of F matrices (including centered and non-centered versions) can be both obtained from that of \bold{\bbom}. %In particular, \bbom can also cover nonzero mean by appropriate matrices \bbU_1 and \bbU_2. %relax the zero mean value restriction for F matrix in \cite{WY} to allow for any nonzero mean vetors. %thus a direct application of our proposed Tracy-Widom distribution is the independence testing via CCA. Moreover, via appropriate matrices \bbU_1 and \bbU_2, this matrix \bold{\bbom} can be applied to some multivariate testing problems that cannot be done by the traditional CCA matrix.
