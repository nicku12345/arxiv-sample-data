In this paper,we consider a macro approximation of the flow of a risk reserve, The process is observed at discrete time points. Because we cannot directly observe each jump time and size then we will make use of a technique for identifying the times when jumps larger than a suitably defined threshold occurred. We estimate the jump size and survival probability of our risk process from discrete observations.
