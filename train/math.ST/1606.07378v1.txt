This paper introduces a new three-parameters model called the Weibull-G exponential distribution (WGED) distribution which exhibits bathtub-shaped hazard rate. Some of it's statistical properties are obtained including quantile, moments, generating functions, reliability and order statistics. The method of maximum likelihood is used for estimating the model parameters and the observed Fisher's information matrix is derived. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model by applications to real data.
