We study asymptotically minimax predictive distributions in an infinite sequence model. First, we discuss the connection between the prediction in the infinite sequence model and the prediction in the function model. Second, we construct an asymptotically minimax predictive distribution when the parameter space is a known ellipsoid. We show that the Bayesian predictive distribution based on the Gaussian prior distribution is asymptotically minimax in the ellipsoid. Third, we construct an asymptotically minimax predictive distribution for any Sobolev ellipsoid. We show that the Bayesian predictive distribution based on the product of Stein's priors is asymptotically minimax for any Sobolev ellipsoid. Finally, we present an efficient sampling method from the proposed Bayesian predictive distribution.
