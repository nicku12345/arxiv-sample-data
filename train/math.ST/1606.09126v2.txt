The iterative proportional fitting procedure, introduced in 1937 by Kruithof, aims to adjust the elements of an array to satisfy specified row and column sums. Given a rectangular non-negative matrix X_0 and two positive marginals a and b, the algorithm generates a sequence of matrices (X_n) starting at X_0, supposed to converge to a biproportional fitting, that is, to a matrix Y whose marginals are a and b and of the form Y=D_1X_0D_2, for some diagonal matrices D_1 and D_2 with positive diagonal entries.   When a biproportional fitting does exist, it is unique and the sequence (X_n) converges to it at an at least geometric rate. More generally, when there exists some matrix with marginal a and b and with support included in the support of X_0, the sequence (X_n) converges to the unique matrix whose marginals are a and b and which can be written as a limit of matrices of the form D_1X_0D_2. In the opposite case, the sequence (X_n) diverges but both subsequences (X_{2n}) and (X_{2n+1}) converge.   In the present paper, we use a new method to prove again these results and determine the two limit-points in the case of divergence. Our proof relies on a new convergence theorem for backward infinite products \cdots M_2M_1 of stochatic matrices M_n, with diagonal entries M_n(i,i) bounded away from 0 and with bounded ratios M_n(j,i)/M_n(i,j). This theorem generalizes Lorenz' stabilization theorem.   We also provide an alternative proof of Touric and Nedi\'c's theorem on backward infinite products of doubly-stochatic matrices, with diagonal entries bounded away from 0. In both situations, we improve slightly the conclusion, since we establish not only the convergence of the sequence (M_n \cdots M_1), but also its finite variation.
