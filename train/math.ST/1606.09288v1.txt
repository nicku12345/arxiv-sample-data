In this paper, we propose some estimators for the parameters of a statistical model based on Kullback-Leibler divergence of the survival function in continuous setting. We prove that the proposed estimators are subclass of "generalized estimating equations" estimators. The asymptotic properties of the estimators such as consistency, asymptotic normality, asymptotic confidence interval and asymptotic hypothesis testing are investigated.
