We define the quantile set of order \alpha \in \left[ 1/2,1\right)  associated to a law P on \mathbb{R}^{d} to be the collection of its directional quantiles seen from an observer O\in \mathbb{R}^{d}. Under minimal assumptions these star-shaped sets are closed surfaces, continuous in (O,\alpha ) and the collection of empirical quantile surfaces is uniformly consistent.\ Under mild assumptions -- no density or symmetry is required for P -- our uniform central limit theorem reveals the correlations between quantile points and a non asymptotic Gaussian approximation provides joint confident enlarged quantile surfaces. Our main result is a dimension free rate n^{-1/4} (\log n)^{1/2}(\log\log n) ^{1/4}  of Bahadur-Kiefer embedding by the empirical process indexed by half-spaces. These limit theorems sharply generalize the univariate quantile convergences and fully characterize the joint behavior of Tukey half-spaces.
