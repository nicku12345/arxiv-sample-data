Penalized regression methods are an attractive tool for high-dimensional data analysis, but their widespread adoption has been hampered by the difficulty of applying inferential tools. In particular, the question "How reliable is the selection of those features?" has proved difficult to address. In part, this difficulty arises from defining false discoveries in the classical, fully conditional sense, which is possible in low dimensions but does not scale well to high-dimensional settings. Here, we consider the analysis of marginal false discovery rates for penalized regression methods. Restricting attention to the marginal FDR permits straightforward estimation of the number of selections that would likely have occurred by chance alone, and therefore provides a useful summary of selection reliability. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies demonstrate that this approach is quite accurate when the correlation among predictors is mild, and only slightly conservative when the correlation is stronger. Finally, the practical utility of the proposed method and its considerable advantages over other approaches are illustrated using gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and GWAS data from the Myocardial Applied Genomics Network.
