We show that the kth order statistic from a heterogeneous sample of n\geq k exponential random variables is larger than that from a homogeneous exponential sample in the sense of star ordering, as conjectured by Xu and Balakrishnan (2012). As a consequence, we establish hazard rate ordering for order statistics between heterogeneous and homogeneous exponential samples, resolving an open problem of P\v{a}lt\v{a}nea (2008). Extensions to general spacings are also presented.
