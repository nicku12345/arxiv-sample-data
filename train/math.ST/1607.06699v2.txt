An approximate maximum likelihood method of estimation of diffusion parameters (\vartheta,\sigma) based on discrete observations of a diffusion X along fixed time-interval [0,T] and Euler approximation of integrals is analyzed. We assume that X satisfies a SDE of form dX_t =\mu (X_t ,\vartheta )\, dt+\sqrt{\sigma} b(X_t )\, dW_t, with non-random initial condition. SDE is nonlinear in \vartheta generally. Based on assumption that maximum likelihood estimator \hat{\vartheta}_T of the drift parameter based on continuous observation of a path over [0,T] exists we prove that measurable estimator (\hat{\vartheta}_{n,T},\hat{\sigma}_{n,T}) of the parameters obtained from discrete observations of X along [0,T] by maximization of the approximate log-likelihood function exists, \hat{\sigma}_{n,T} being consistent and asymptotically normal, and \hat{\vartheta}_{n,T}-\hat{\vartheta}_T tends to zero with rate \sqrt{\delta}_{n,T} in probability when \delta_{n,T} =\max_{0\leq i<n}(t_{i+1}-t_i ) tends to zero with T fixed. The same holds in case of an ergodic diffusion when T goes to infinity in a way that T\delta_n goes to zero with equidistant sampling, and we applied these to show consistency and asymptotical normality of \hat{\vartheta}_{n,T}, \hat{\sigma}_{n,T} and asymptotic efficiency of \hat{\vartheta}_{n,T} in this case.
