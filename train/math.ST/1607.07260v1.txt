For 0<q< d fixed let W^{[q,d]}=(W^{[q,d]}_t)_{t\in {[q,d]}} be a (q,d)-Slepian-process defined as centered, stationary Gaussian process with continuous sample paths and covariance   \begin{align*} C_{W^{[q,d]}}(s,s+t) = (1-\frac{t}{q})^+, \quad q\leq s\leq s+t\leq d.   \end{align*} Note that   \begin{align*} \frac{1}{\sqrt{q}}(B_t-B_{t-q})_{t\in [q,d]}, \end{align*} where B_t is standard Brownian motion, is a (q,d)-Slepian-process. In this paper we prove an analytical formula for the boundary crossing probability \mathbb{P}\left(W^{[q,d]}_t > g(t) \; \text{for some } t\in[q,d]\right), q< d\leq 2q, in the case g is a piecewise affine function. This formula can be used as approximation for the boundary crossing probability of an arbitrary boundary by approximating the boundary function by piecewise affine functions.
