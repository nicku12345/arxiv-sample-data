Likelihood ratio tests are widely used to test statistical hypotheses about parametric families of probability distributions. If interest is restricted to a subfamily of distributions, then it is natural to inquire if the restricted LRT is superior to the unrestricted LRT. Marden's general LRT conjecture posits that any restriction placed on the alternative hypothesis will increase power. The only published counterexample to this conjecture is rather technical and involves a restriction that maintains the dimension of the alternative. We formulate the dimension-restricted LRT conjecture, which posits that any restriction that replaces a parametric family with a subfamily of lower dimension will increase power. Under standard regularity conditions, we then demonstrate that the restricted LRT is asymptotically more powerful than the unrestricted LRT for local alternatives. Remarkably, however, even the dimension-restricted LRT conjecture fails in the case of finite samples. Our counterexamples involve subfamilies of multinomial distributions. In particular, our study of the Hardy-Weinberg subfamily of trinomial distributions provides a simple and elegant demonstration that restrictions may not increase power.
