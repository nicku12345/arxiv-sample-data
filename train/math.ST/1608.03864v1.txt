It was shown in [6] that the Wasserstein distance is equivalent to the Mean Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (MOSPA) measure for empirical probability density functions. A more recent paper [7], extends on it by drawing new connections between the MOSPA concept, which is getting a foothold in the multi-target tracking community, and the Wasserstein distance, a metric widely used in theoretical statistics. However, the comparison between the two concepts has been overlooked. In this letter we prove that the equivalence of Wasserstein distance with the MOSPA measure holds for general types of probability density function. This non trivial result allows us to leverage one recent finding in the computational geometry literature to show that the Minimum MOPSA (MMOSPA) estimates are the centroids of additive weighted Voronoi regions with a specific choice of the weights.
