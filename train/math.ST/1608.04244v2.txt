We propose a two-step pseudo-maximum likelihood procedure for semiparametric single-index regression models where the conditional variance is a known function of the regression and an additional parameter. The Poisson single-index regression with multiplicative unobserved heterogeneity is an example of such models. Our procedure is based on linear exponential densities with nuisance parameter. The pseudo-likelihood criterion we use contains a nonparametric estimate of the index regression and therefore a rule for choosing the smoothing parameter is needed. We propose an automatic and natural rule based on the joint maximization of the pseudo-likelihood with respect to the index parameter and the smoothing parameter. We derive the asymptotic properties of the semiparametric estimator of the index parameter and the asymptotic behavior of our `optimal' smoothing parameter. The finite sample performances of our methodology are analyzed using simulated and real data.
