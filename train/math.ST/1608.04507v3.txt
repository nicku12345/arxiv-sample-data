It is considered Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process  x_t = x_0 e^{-\theta t} + \mu (1-e^{-\theta t}) + \sigma \int_0^t e^{-\theta (t-s)} dW_s, where x_0 \in R, \theta>0,  \mu \in R and \sigma > 0 are parameters. By use values (z_k)_{k \in N} of corresponding trajectories at a fixed positive moment t, a consistent estimate of each unknown parameter of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck's stochastic process is constructed under assumption that all another parameters are known.
