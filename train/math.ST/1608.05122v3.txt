We consider a multivariable functional errors-in-variables model AX\approx B, where the data matrices A and B are observed with errors, and a matrix parameter X is to be estimated. A goodness-of-fit test is constructed based on the total least squares estimator. The proposed test is asymptotically chi-squared under null hypothesis. The power of the test under local alternatives is discussed.
