Another new family of continuous probability distribution is proposed by using Generalized Marshal-Olkin distribution as the base line distribution in the Kumaraswamy-G distribution. This family includes (Cordeiro and de Castro, 2011) and (Jayakumar and Mathew, 2008) families special case besides a under of other distributions. The probability density function (pdf) and the survival function (sf) are expressed as series to observe as a mixture of the Generalized Marshal-Olkin distribution. Series expansions pdf of order statistics are also obtained. Moments, moment generating function, R\'enyi entropies, quantile function, random sample generation and asymptotes are also investigated. Parameter estimation by method of maximum likelihood and method of moment are also presented. Finally the proposed model is compared to the Generalized Marshall-Olkin Kumaraswamy extended family (Handique and Chakraborty, 2015) by considering four examples of real life data modeling.
