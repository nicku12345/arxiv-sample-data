A general type of a Split-BREAK process with Gaussian innovations (henceforth, Gaussian Split-BREAK or GSB process) is considered. The basic stochastic properties of the model are studied and its characteristic function derived. A procedure to estimate the parameter of the GSB model based on the Empirical Characteristic Function (ECF) is proposed. Our simulations suggest that the proposed method performs well compared to a Method of Moment procedure used as benchmark. The empirical use of the GSB model is illustrated with an application to the time series of total values of shares traded at Belgrade Stock Exchange.
