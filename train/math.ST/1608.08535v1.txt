In this paper we compare the minimums of two independent and heterogeneous samples each following Kumaraswamy-G distribution with the same and the different parent distribution functions. The comparisons are carried out with respect to usual stochastic ordering and hazard rate ordering with majorized shape parameters of the distributions. The likelihood ratio ordering between the minimum order statistics is established for heterogeneous multiple outlier Kumaraswamy-G random variables with the same parent distribution function
