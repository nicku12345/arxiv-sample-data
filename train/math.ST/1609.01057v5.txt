Tree-structured data naturally appear in various fields, particularly in biology where plants and blood vessels may be described by trees, but also in computer science because XML documents form a tree structure. This paper is devoted to the estimation of the relative scale parameter of conditioned Galton-Watson trees. New estimators are introduced and their consistency is stated. A comparison is made with an existing approach of the literature. A simulation study shows the good behavior of our procedure on finite-sample sizes and from missing or noisy data. An application to the analysis of revisions of Wikipedia articles is also considered through real data.
