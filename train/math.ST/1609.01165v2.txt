Suppose that a mobile sensor describes a Markovian trajectory in the ambient space. At each time the sensor measures an attribute of interest, e.g., the temperature. Using only the location history of the sensor and the associated measurements, the aim is to estimate the average value of the attribute over the space. In contrast to classical probabilistic integration methods, e.g., Monte Carlo, the proposed approach does not require any knowledge on the distribution of the sensor trajectory. Probabilistic bounds on the convergence rates of the estimator are established. These rates are better than the traditional "root n"-rate, where n is the sample size, attached to other probabilistic integration methods. For finite sample sizes, the good behaviour of the procedure is demonstrated through simulations and an application to the evaluation of the average temperature of oceans is considered.
