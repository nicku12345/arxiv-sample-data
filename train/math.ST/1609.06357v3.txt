This paper concerns solving the sparse deconvolution and demixing problem using \ell_{1,2}-minimization. We show that under a certain structured random model, robust and stable recovery is possible. The results extend results of Ling and Strohmer [Self Calibration and Biconvex Compressive Sensing, Inverse Problems, 2015], and in particular theoretically explain certain experimental findings from that paper. Our results do not only apply to the deconvolution and demixing problem, but to recovery of column-sparse matrices in general.
