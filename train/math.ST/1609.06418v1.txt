Some large scale inference problems are considered based on using the relative belief ratio as a measure of statistical evidence. This approach is applied to the multiple testing problem. A particular application of this is concerned with assessing sparsity. The approach taken to sparsity has several advantages as it is based on a measure of evidence and does not require that the prior be restricted in any way.
