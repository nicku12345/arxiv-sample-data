We consider the smoothed maximum likelihood estimator and the smoothed Grenander-type estimator for a monotone baseline hazard rate \lambda_0 in the Cox model. We analyze their asymptotic behavior and show that they are asymptotically normal at rate n^{m/(2m+1)}, when~\lambda_0 is m\geq 2 times continuously differentiable, and that both estimators are asymptotically equivalent. Finally, we present numerical results on pointwise confidence intervals that illustrate the comparable behavior of the two methods.
