Nonparametric density estimators are studied for d-dimensional, strongly spatial mixing data which is defined on a general N-dimensional lattice structure. We consider linear and nonlinear hard thresholded wavelet estimators which are derived from a d-dimensional multiresolution analysis. We give sufficient criteria for the consistency of these estimators and derive rates of convergence in L^{p'} for p'\in [1,\infty). For this reason, we study density functions which are elements of a d-dimensional Besov space B^s_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d). We also verify the analytic correctness of our results in numerical simulations.
