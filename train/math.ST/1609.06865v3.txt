We study a nonparametric regression model for sample data which is defined on an N-dimensional lattice structure and which is assumed to be strong spatial mixing: we use design adapted multidimensional Haar wavelets which form an orthonormal system w.r.t. the empirical measure of the sample data. For such orthonormal systems, we consider a nonparametric hard thresholding estimator. We give sufficient criteria for the consistency of this estimator and we derive rates of convergence. The theorems reveal that our estimator is able to adapt to the local smoothness of the underlying regression function and the design distribution. We illustrate our results with simulated examples.
