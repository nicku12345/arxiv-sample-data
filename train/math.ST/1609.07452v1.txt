In this paper a robust version of the classical Wald test statistics for linear hypothesis in the logistic regression model is introduced and its properties are explored. We study the problem under the assumption of random covariates although some ideas with non random covariates are also considered. The family of tests considered is based on the minimum density power divergence estimator instead of the maximum likelihood estimator and it is referred to as the Wald-type test statistic in the paper. We obtain the asymptotic distribution and also study the robustness properties of the Wald type test statistic. The robustness of the tests is investigated theoretically through the influence function analysis as well as suitable practical examples. It is theoretically established that the level as well as the power of the Wald-type tests are stable against contamination, while the classical Wald type test breaks down in this scenario. Some classical examples are presented which numerically substantiate the theory developed. Finally a simulation study is included to provide further confirmation of the validity of the theoretical results established in the paper.
