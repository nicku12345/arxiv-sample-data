In this paper, we investigate various stochastic orderings for series and parallel systems with independent and heterogeneous components having lifetimes following the proportional odds model. We also investigate comparisons between system with heterogeneous components and that with homogeneous components. This paper also studies relative ageing orders for two systems in the framework of components having lifetimes following the proportional odds model.
