We introduce non-stationary Mat\'ern field priors with stochastic partial differential equations, and construct correlation length-scaling with hyperpriors. We model both the hyperprior and the Mat\'ern prior as continuous-parameter random fields. As hypermodels, we use Cauchy and Gaussian random fields, which we map suitably to a desired correlation length-scaling range. For computations, we discretise the models with finite difference methods. We consider the convergence of the discretised prior and posterior to the discretisation limit. We apply the developed methodology to certain interpolation and numerical differentiation problems, and show numerically that we can make Bayesian inversion which promotes competing constraints of smoothness and edge-preservation. For computing the conditional mean estimator of the posterior distribution, we use a combination of Gibbs and Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling algorithms.
