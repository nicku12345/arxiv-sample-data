~It is considered a transmittion process of a useful signal in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model in \mathbb{C}[-l,l[ defined by the stochastic differential equation  d\Psi(t,x,\omega)=\sum_{n=0}^{2m} A_n\frac{\partial^{n}}{\partial x^{n}}\Psi(t,x,\omega)dt +\sigma d W(t,\omega)  with initial condition \Psi(0,x,\omega)=\Psi_0(x) \in FD^{(0)}[-l,l[,  where m \ge 1, (A_n)_{0 \le n \le 2m} \in \mathbb{R}^+\times \mathbb{R}^{2m-1},~((t,x,\omega) \in [0,+\infty[\times [-l,l[ \times \Omega), \sigma \in \mathbb{R}^+, \mathbb{C}[-l,l[ is Banach space of all real-valued bounded continuous functions on [-l,l[, FD^{(0)}[-l,l[ \subset \mathbb{C}[-l,l[  is class of all real-valued bounded continuous functions on [-l,l[ whose Fourier series converges to himself everywhere on [-l,l[, (W(t,\omega))_{t \ge 0} is a Wiener process and \Psi_0(x) is a useful signal.   By use a sequence of transformed signals (Z_k)_{k \in N}=(\Psi(t_0,x,\omega_k))_{k \in N} at moment t_0>0, consistent and infinite-sample consistent estimations of the useful signal \Psi_0 is constructed under assumption that parameters (A_n)_{0 \le n \le 2m} and \sigma are known. Animation and simulation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in \mathbb{C}[-l,l[ and an estimation of a useful signal are also presented.
