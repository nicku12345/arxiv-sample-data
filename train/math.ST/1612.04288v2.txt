Under standard regularity assumptions, we provide simple approximations for specific classes of fiducial and confidence distributions and discuss their connections with objective Bayesian posteriors. For a real parameter the approximations are accurate at least to order O(1/n). For the mean parameter of a multivariate exponential family, our fiducial distribution is asymptotically normal and invariant to the importance ordering of the components of the mean parameter.
