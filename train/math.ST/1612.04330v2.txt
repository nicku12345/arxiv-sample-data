We consider a phase retrieval problem, where we want to reconstruct a n-dimensional vector from its phaseless scalar products with m sensing vectors, independently sampled from complex normal distributions. We show that, with a suitable initalization procedure, the classical algorithm of alternating projections succeeds with high probability when m\geq Cn, for some C>0. We conjecture that this result is still true when no special initialization procedure is used, and present numerical experiments that support this conjecture.
