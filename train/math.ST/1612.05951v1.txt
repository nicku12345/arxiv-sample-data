This paper deals with the asymptotic statistical properties of a class of redescending M-estimators in linear models with increasing dimension. This class is wide enough to include popular high breakdown point estimators such as S-estimators and MM-estimators, which were not covered by existing results in the literature. We prove consistency assuming only that p/n \rightarrow 0 and asymptotic normality essentially if p^{3}/n \rightarrow 0, where p is the number of covariates and n is the sample size.
