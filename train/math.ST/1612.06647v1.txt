We consider Grenander type estimators for a monotone function \lambda:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}, obtained as the slope of a concave (convex) estimate of the primitive of \lambda. Our main result is a central limit theorem for the Hellinger loss, which applies to statistical models that satisfy the setup in Durot (2007). This includes estimation of a monotone density, for which the limiting variance of the Hellinger loss turns out to be independent of \lambda.
