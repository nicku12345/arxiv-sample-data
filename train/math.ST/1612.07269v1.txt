A new index based on empirical copulas, termed the Copula Statistic (CoS), is introduced for assessing the strength of multivariate dependence and for testing statistical independence. New properties of the copulas are proved. They allow us to define the CoS in terms of a relative distance function between the empirical copula, the Fr\'echet-Hoeffding bounds and the independence copula. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that for large sample sizes, the CoS is approximately normal. This property is utilised to develop a CoS-based statistical test of independence against various noisy functional dependencies. It is shown that this test exhibits higher statistical power than the Total Information Coefficient (TICe), the Distance Correlation (dCor), the Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC), and the Copula Correlation (Ccor) for monotonic and circular functional dependencies. Furthermore, the R2-equitability of the CoS is investigated for estimating the strength of a collection of functional dependencies with additive Gaussian noise. Finally, the CoS is applied to a real stock market data set from which we infer that a bivariate analysis is insufficient to unveil multivariate dependencies and to two gene expression data sets of the Yeast and of the E. Coli, which allow us to demonstrate the good performance of the CoS.
