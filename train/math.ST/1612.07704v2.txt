In this article, we consider the problem of estimating the index parameter \alpha_0 in the single index model E[Y |X] = f_0(\alpha_0^T X) with f_0 the unknown ridge function defined on \mathbb{R}, X a d-dimensional covariate and Y the response. We show that when X is Gaussian, then \alpha_0 can be consistently estimated by regressing the observed responses Y_i, i = 1, . . ., n on the covariates X_1, . . ., X_n after centering and rescaling. The method works without any additional smoothness assumptions on f_0 and only requires that cov(f_0(\alpha_0^T X),\alpha_0^TX) \neq 0, which is always satisfied by monotone and non-constant functions f_0. We show that our estimator is asymptotically normal and give the expression with its asymptotic variance. The approach is illustrated through a simulation study.
