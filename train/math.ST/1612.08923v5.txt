Given a sequence of independent Bernoulli variables with unknown parameter p, and a function f expressed as a power series with non-negative coefficients that sum to at most 1, an algorithm is presented that produces a Bernoulli variable with parameter f(p). In particular, the algorithm can simulate f(p)=p^a, a\in(0,1). For functions with a derivative growing at least as f(p)/p for p\rightarrow 0, the average number of inputs required by the algorithm is asymptotically optimal among all simulations that are fast in the sense of Nacu and Peres. A non-randomized version of the algorithm is also given. Some extensions are discussed.
