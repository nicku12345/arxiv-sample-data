In this paper we establish the uniform in bandwidth consistency for the transformation kernel estimator of copulas introduced in [Omelka et al.(2009)]. To this end, we first prove a uniform in bandwidth law of the iterated logarithm for the maximal deviation of this estimator from its expectation. We then show that, as n goes to infinity, the bias of the estimator converges to zero uniformly in the bandwidth h, varying over a suitable interval. A practical method of selecting the optimal bandwidth is also presented. Finally, we make conclusive simulation experiments showing the performance of the estimator in finite samples.
