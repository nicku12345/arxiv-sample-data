In this paper we develop a generalized likelihood ratio scan method (GLRSM) for multiple change-points inference in piecewise stationary time series, which estimates the number and positions of change-points and provides a confidence interval for each change-point. The computational complexity of using GLRSM for multiple change-points detection is as low as O(n(\log n)^3) for a series of length n. Consistency of the estimated numbers and positions of the change-points is established. Extensive simulation studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology under different scenarios.
