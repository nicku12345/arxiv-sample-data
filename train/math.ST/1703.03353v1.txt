We consider the problem of choosing between parametric models for a discrete observable, taking a Bayesian approach in which the within-model prior distributions are allowed to be improper. In order to avoid the ambiguity in the marginal likelihood function in such a case, we apply a homogeneous scoring rule. For the particular case of distinguishing between Poisson and Negative Binomial models, we conduct simulations that indicate that, applied prequentially, the method will consistently select the true model.
