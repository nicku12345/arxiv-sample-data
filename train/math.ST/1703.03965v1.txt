We proposed a new penalized method in this paper to solve sparse Poisson Regression problems. Being different from \ell_1 penalized log-likelihood estimation, our new method can be viewed as penalized weighted score function method. We show that under mild conditions, our estimator is \ell_1 consistent and the tuning parameter can be pre-specified, which shares the same good property of the square-root Lasso.
