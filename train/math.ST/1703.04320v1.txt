Classical spectral analysis is based on the discrete Fourier transform of the auto-covariances. In this paper we investigate the asymptotic properties of new frequency domain methods where the auto-covariances in the spectral density are replaced by alternative dependence measures which can be estimated by U-statistics. An interesting example is given by Kendall{'}s \tau , for which the limiting variance exhibits a surprising behavior.
