We introduce in this paper a new generalization of the flexible Weibull distribution with four parameters. This model based on the Beta generalized (BG) distribution, Eugene et al. \cite{Eugeneetal2002}, they first using the BG distribution for generating new generalizations. This new model is called the beta flexible Weibull BFW distribution. Some statistical properties such as the mode, the rth moment, skewness and kurtosis are derived. The moment generating function and the order statistics are obtained. Moreover, the estimations of the parameters are given by maximum likelihood method and the Fisher's information matrix is derived. Finally, we study the advantage of the BFW distribution by an application using real data set.
