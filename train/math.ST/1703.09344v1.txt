This paper proposes an algorithm to estimate the parameters, including time delay, of continuous time systems based on instrumental variable identification methods. To overcome the multiple local minima of the cost function associated with the estimation of a time delay system, we utilise the useful redundancy technique. Specifically, the cost function is filtered through a set of low-pass filters to improve convexity with the useful redundancy technique exploited to achieve convergence to the global minimum of the optimization problem. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
