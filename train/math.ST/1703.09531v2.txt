The estimation of a log-concave density on \mathbb{R} is a canonical problem in the area of shape-constrained nonparametric inference. We present a Bayesian nonparametric approach to this problem based on an exponentiated Dirichlet process mixture prior and show that the posterior distribution converges to the log-concave truth at the (near-) minimax rate in Hellinger distance. Our proof proceeds by establishing a general contraction result based on the log-concave maximum likelihood estimator that prevents the need for further metric entropy calculations. We also present two computationally more feasible approximations and a more practical empirical Bayes approach, which are illustrated numerically via simulations.
