This paper deals with the problem of estimating predictive densities of a matrix-variate normal distribution with known covariance matrix. Our main aim is to establish some Bayesian predictive densities related to matricial shrinkage estimators of the normal mean matrix. The Kullback-Leibler loss is used for evaluating decision-theoretical optimality of predictive densities. It is shown that a proper hierarchical prior yields an admissible and minimax predictive density. Also, superharmonicity of prior densities is paid attention to for finding out a minimax predictive density with good numerical performance.
