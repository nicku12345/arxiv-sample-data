Cox proportional hazards model with measurement error is investigated. In Kukush et al. (2011) [Journal of Statistical Research 45, 77-94] and Chimisov and Kukush (2014) [Modern Stochastics: Theory and Applications 1, 13-32] asymptotic properties of simultaneous estimator \lambda_n(\cdot), \beta_n were studied for baseline hazard rate \lambda(\cdot) and regression parameter \beta, at that the parameter set \Theta=\Theta_{\lambda}\times \Theta_{\beta} was assumed bounded. In the present paper, the set \Theta_{\lambda} is unbounded from above and not separated away from 0. We construct the estimator in two steps: first we derive a strongly consistent estimator and then modify it to provide its asymptotic normality.
