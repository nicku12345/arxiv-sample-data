We consider the problem of isotonic regression, where the underlying signal x is assumed to satisfy a monotonicity constraint, that is, x lies in the cone \{ x\in\mathbb{R}^n : x_1 \leq \dots \leq x_n\}. We study the isotonic projection operator (projection to this cone), and find a necessary and sufficient condition characterizing all norms with respect to which this projection is contractive. This enables a simple and non-asymptotic analysis of the convergence properties of isotonic regression, yielding uniform confidence bands that adapt to the local Lipschitz properties of the signal.
