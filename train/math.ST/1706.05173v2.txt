We consider the process \widehat\Lambda_n-\Lambda_n, where \Lambda_n is a cadlag step estimator for the primitive \Lambda of a nonincreasing function \lambda on [0,1], and \widehat\Lambda_n is the least concave majorant of \Lambda_n. We extend the results in Kulikov and Lopuha\"a (2006, 2008) to the general setting considered in Durot (2007). Under this setting we prove that a suitably scaled version of \widehat\Lambda_n-\Lambda_n converges in distribution to the corresponding process for two-sided Brownian motion with parabolic drift and we establish a central limit theorem for the L_p-distance between \widehat\Lambda_n and \Lambda_n.
