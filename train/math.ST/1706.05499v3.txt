In this paper, we further develop the theory of complete mixability and joint mixability for some distribution families. We generalize a result of R\"uschendorf and Uckelmann (2002) related to complete mixability of continuous distribution function having a symmetric and unimodal density. Two different proofs to a result of Wang and Wang (2016) which related to the joint mixability of elliptical distributions with the same characteristic generator are present. We solve the Open Problem 7 in Wang (2015) by constructing a bimodal-symmetric distribution. The joint mixability of slash-elliptical distributions and skew-elliptical distributions is studied and the extension to multivariate distributions is also investigated.
