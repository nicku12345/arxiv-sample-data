This paper considers the optimal modification of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) for the equality of two high-dimensional covariance matrices. The classical LRT is not well defined when the dimensions are larger than or equal to one of the sample sizes. In this paper, an optimally modified test that works well in cases where the dimensions may be larger than the sample sizes is proposed. In addition, the test is established under the weakest conditions on the moments and the dimensions of the samples. We also present weakly consistent estimators of the fourth moments, which are necessary for the proposed test, when they are not equal to 3. From the simulation results and real data analysis, we find that the performances of the proposed statistics are robust against affine transformations.
