Estimating a high-dimensional sparse covariance matrix from a limited number of samples is a fundamental problem in contemporary data analysis. Most proposals to date, however, are not robust to outliers or heavy tails. Towards bridging this gap, in this work we consider estimating a sparse shape matrix from n samples following a possibly heavy tailed elliptical distribution. We propose estimators based on thresholding either Tyler's M-estimator or its regularized variant. We derive bounds on the difference in spectral norm between our estimators and the shape matrix in the joint limit as the dimension p and sample size n tend to infinity with p/n\to\gamma>0. These bounds are minimax rate-optimal. Results on simulated data support our theoretical analysis.
