The beta family owes its privileged status within unit interval distributions to several relevant features such as, for example, easyness of interpretation and versatility in modeling different types of data. However, its flexibility at the unit interval endpoints is poor enough to prevent from properly modeling the portions of data having values next to zero and one. Such a drawback can be overcome by resorting to the class of the non-central beta distributions. Indeed, the latter allows the density to take on arbitrary positive and finite limits which have a really simple form. That said, new insights into such class are provided in this paper. In particular, new representations and moments expressions are derived. Moreover, its potential with respect to alternative models is highlighted through applications to real data.
