Space-filling designs are popular choices for computer experiments. A sliced design is a design that can be partitioned into several subdesigns. We propose a new type of sliced space-filling design called sliced rotated sphere packing designs. Their full designs and subdesigns are rotated sphere packing designs. They are constructed by rescaling, rotating, translating and extracting the points from a sliced lattice. We provide two fast algorithms to generate such designs. Furthermore, we propose a strategy to use sliced rotated sphere packing designs adaptively. Under this strategy, initial runs are uniformly distributed in the design space, follow-up runs are added by incorporating information gained from initial runs, and the combined design is space-filling for any local region. Examples are given to illustrate its potential application.
