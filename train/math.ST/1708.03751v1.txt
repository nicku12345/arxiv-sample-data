In this paper, we discuss the use of \varepsilon-admissibility for estimation in high-dimensional and nonparametric statistical models. The minimax rate of convergence is widely used to compare the performance of estimators in high-dimensional and nonparametric models. However, it often works poorly as a criterion of comparison. In such cases, the addition of comparison by \varepsilon-admissibility provides a better outcome. We demonstrate the usefulness of \varepsilon-admissibility through high-dimensional Poisson model and Gaussian infinite sequence model, and present noble results.
