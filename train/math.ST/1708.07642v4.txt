We study principal component analysis (PCA) for mean zero i.i.d. Gaussian observations X_1,\dots, X_n in a separable Hilbert space \mathbb{H} with unknown covariance operator \Sigma. The complexity of the problem is characterized by its effective rank {\bf r}(\Sigma):= \frac{{\rm tr}(\Sigma)}{\|\Sigma\|}, where {\rm tr}(\Sigma) denotes the trace of \Sigma and \|\Sigma\| denotes its operator norm. We develop a method of bias reduction in the problem of estimation of linear functionals of eigenvectors of \Sigma. Under the assumption that {\bf r}(\Sigma)=o(n), we establish the asymptotic normality and asymptotic properties of the risk of the resulting estimators and prove matching minimax lower bounds, showing their semi-parametric optimality.
