In this manuscript we present exponential inequalities for spatial lattice processes which take values in a separable Hilbert space and satisfy certain dependence conditions. We consider two types of dependence: spatial data under \alpha-mixing conditions and spatial data which satisfies a weak dependence condition introduced by Dedecker and Prieur [2005]. We demonstrate their usefulness in the functional kernel regression model of Ferraty and Vieu [2004] where we study uniform consistency properties of the estimated regression operator on increasing subsets of the underlying function space.
