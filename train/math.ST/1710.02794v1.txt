This paper investigates estimation of the mean vector under invariant quadratic loss for a spherically symmetric location family with a residual vector with density of the form  f(x,u)=\eta^{(p+n)/2}f(\eta\{\|x-\theta\|^2+\|u\|^2\}) , where \eta is unknown. We show that the natural estimator x is admissible for p=1,2. Also, for p\geq 3, we find classes of generalized Bayes estimators that are admissible within the class of equivariant estimators of the form \{1-\xi(x/\|u\|)\}x. In the Gaussian case, a variant of the James--Stein estimator, [1-\{(p-2)/(n+2)\}/\{\|x\|^2/\|u\|^2+(p-2)/(n+2)+1\}]x, which dominates the natural estimator x, is also admissible within this class. We also study the related regression model.
