In this paper we continue the investigation of the SRCEN estimator of the extreme value index \gamma (or the tail index \alpha=1/\gamma) proposed in \cite{MCE} for \gamma>1/2. We propose a new estimator based on the local maximum. This, in fact, is a modification of the SRCEN estimator to the case \gamma>0. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the newly proposed estimator for i.i.d. data. Also, a short discussion on the comparison of the estimators is included.
