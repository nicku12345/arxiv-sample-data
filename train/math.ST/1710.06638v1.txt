The processes of the averaged regression quantiles and of their modifications provide useful tools in the regression models when the covariates are not fully under our control. As an application we mention the probabilistic risk assessment in the situation when the return depends on some exogenous variables. The processes enable to evaluate the expected \alpha-shortfall (0\leq\alpha\leq 1) and other measures of the risk, recently generally accepted in the financial literature, but also help to measure the risk in environment analysis and elsewhere.
