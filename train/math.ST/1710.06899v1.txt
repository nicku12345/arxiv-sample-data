We study improved approximations to the distribution of the largest eigenvalue \hat{\ell} of the sample covariance matrix of n zero-mean Gaussian observations in dimension p+1. We assume that one population principal component has variance \ell > 1 and the remaining `noise' components have common variance 1. In the high dimensional limit p/n \to \gamma > 0, we begin study of Edgeworth corrections to the limiting Gaussian distribution of \hat{\ell} in the supercritical case \ell > 1 + \sqrt \gamma. The skewness correction involves a quadratic polynomial as in classical settings, but the coefficients reflect the high dimensional structure. The methods involve Edgeworth expansions for sums of independent non-identically distributed variates obtained by conditioning on the sample noise eigenvalues, and limiting bulk properties \textit{and} fluctuations of these noise eigenvalues.
