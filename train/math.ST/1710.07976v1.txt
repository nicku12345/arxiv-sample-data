We introduce the discrete distribution of a Wiener process range. Rather than finding some basic distributional properties including hazard rate function, moments, Stress-strength parameter and order statistics of this distribution, this work studies some basic properties of the truncated version of this distribution. The effectiveness of this distribution is established using a data set.
