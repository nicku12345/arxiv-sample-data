This paper deals with the maximum likelihood estimator for the mean-reverting parameter of a first order autoregressive models with exogenous variables, which are stationary Gaussian noises (Colored noise). Using the method of the Laplace transform, both the asymptotic properties and the asymptotic design problem of the maximum likelihood estimator are investigated. The numerical simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed maximum likelihood estimator performs well in finite sample.
