This article is dedicated to the estimation of Wasserstein distances and Wasserstein costs between two distinct continuous distributions F and G on \mathbb R. The estimator is based on the order statistics of (possibly dependent) samples of F resp. G. We prove the consistency and the asymptotic normality of our estimators. \begin{it}Keywords:\end{it} Central Limit Theorems- Generelized Wasserstein distances- Empirical processes- Strong approximation- Dependent samples.
