This paper addresses the question of whether it is possible to generate networks with a given global structure (defined by selected blockmodels, i.e., cohesive, core-periphery, hierarchical and transitivity), considering only different types of triads. Two methods are used to generate networks: (i) the method of relocating links; and (ii) the Monte Carlo Multi Chain algorithm implemented in the "ergm" package implemented in R. Although all types of triads can generate networks with the selected blockmodel types, the selection of only a subset of triads improves the generated networks' blockmodel structure. However, in the case of a hierarchical blockmodel without complete blocks on the diagonal, additional local structures are needed to achieve the desired global structure of generated networks. This shows that blockmodels can emerge based on only local processes that do not take attributes into account.
