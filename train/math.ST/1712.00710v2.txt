We consider sparse matrix estimation where the goal is to estimate an n\times n matrix from noisy observations of a small subset of its entries. We analyze the estimation error of the popularly utilized collaborative filtering algorithm for the sparse regime. Specifically, we propose a novel iterative variant of the algorithm, adapted to handle the setting of sparse observations. We establish that as long as the fraction of entries observed at random scale as \frac{\log^{1+\kappa}}{n} for any fixed \kappa > 0, the estimation error with respect to the \max-norm decays to 0 as n\to\infty assuming the underlying matrix of interest has constant rank r.
