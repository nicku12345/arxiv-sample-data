We demonstrate that a prior influence on the posterior distribution of covariance matrix vanishes as sample size grows. The assumptions on a prior are explicit and mild. The results are valid for a finite sample and admit the dimension p growing with the sample size n. We exploit the described fact to derive the finite sample Bernstein-von Mises theorem for functionals of covariance matrix (e.g. eigenvalues) and to find the posterior distribution of the Frobenius distance between spectral projector and empirical spectral projector. This can be useful for constructing sharp confidence sets for the true value of the functional or for the true spectral projector.
