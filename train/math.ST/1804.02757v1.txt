We consider a fractional Brownian motion with unknown linear drift such that the drift coefficient has a prior normal distribution and construct a sequential test for the hypothesis that the drift is positive versus the alternative that it is negative. We show that the problem of constructing the test reduces to an optimal stopping problem for a standard Brownian motion, obtained by a transformation of the fractional one. The solution is described as the first exit time from some set, whose boundaries are shown to satisfy a certain integral equation, which is solved numerically.
