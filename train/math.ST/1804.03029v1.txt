This paper deals with the problem of estimating a slope parameter in a simple linear regression model, where independent variables have functional measurement errors. Measurement errors in independent variables, as is well known, cause biasedness of the ordinary least squares estimator. A general procedure for the bias reduction is presented in a finite sample situation, and some exact bias-reduced estimators are proposed. Also, it is shown that certain truncation procedures improve the mean square errors of the ordinary least squares and the bias-reduced estimators.
