The paper deals with minimax optimal statistical tests for two composite hypotheses, where each hypothesis is defined by a non-parametric uncertainty set of feasible distributions. It is shown that for every pair of uncertainty sets of the f-divergence ball type, a pair of uncertainty sets of the density band type can be constructed, which is equivalent in the sense that it admits the same pair of least favorable distributions. This result implies that robust tests under f-divergence ball uncertainty, which are typically only minimax optimal for the single sample case, are also fixed sample size minimax optimal with respect to the equivalent density band uncertainty sets.
