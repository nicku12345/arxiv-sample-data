A popular class of problem in statistics deals with estimating the support of a density from n observations drawn at random from a d-dimensional distribution. The one-dimensional case reduces to estimating the end points of a univariate density. In practice, an experimenter may only have access to a noisy version of the original data. Therefore, a more realistic model allows for the observations to be contaminated with additive noise.   In this paper, we consider estimation of convex bodies when the additive noise is distributed according to a multivariate Gaussian distribution, even though our techniques could easily be adapted to other noise distributions. Unlike standard methods in deconvolution that are implemented by thresholding a kernel density estimate, our method avoids tuning parameters and Fourier transforms altogether. We show that our estimator, computable in (O(\ln n))^{(d-1)/2} time, converges at a rate of  O_d(\log\log n/\sqrt{\log n})  in Hausdorff distance, in accordance with the polylogarithmic rates encountered in Gaussian deconvolution problems. Part of our analysis also involves the optimality of the proposed estimator. We provide a lower bound for the minimax rate of estimation in Hausdorff distance that is \Omega_d(1/\log^2 n).
