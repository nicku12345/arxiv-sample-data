We consider stationary time series \{X_j, j \in Z\} whose finite dimensional distributions are regularly varying with extremal independence. We assume that for each h \geq 1, conditionally on X_0 to exceed a threshold tending to infinity, the conditional distribution of X_h suitably normalized converges weakly to a non degenerate distribution. We consider in this paper the estimation of the normalization and of the limiting distribution.
