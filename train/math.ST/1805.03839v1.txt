In this note we consider PCA for Gaussian observations X_1,\dots, X_n with covariance \Sigma=\sum_i \lambda_i P_i in the 'effective rank' setting with model complexity governed by \mathbf{r}(\Sigma):=\text{tr}(\Sigma)/\| \Sigma \|. We prove a Berry-Essen type bound for a Wald Statistic of the spectral projector \hat P_r. This can be used to construct non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids and tests for spectral projectors P_r. Using higher order pertubation theory we are able to show that our Theorem remains valid even when \mathbf{r}(\Sigma) \gg \sqrt{n}.
