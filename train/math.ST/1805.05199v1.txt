In this paper, a new bivariate discrete distribution is introduced which called bivariate discrete exponentiated Weibull (BDEW) distribution. Several of its mathematical statistical properties are derived such as the joint cumulative distribution function, the joint joint hazard rate function, probability mass function, joint moment generating function, mathematical expectation and reliability function for stress-strength model. Further, the parameters of the BDEW distribution are estimated by the maximum likelihood method. Two real data sets are analyzed, and it was found that the BDEW distribution provides better fit than other discrete distributions.
