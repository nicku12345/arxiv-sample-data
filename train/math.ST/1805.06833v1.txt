Given a distribution in the unite square and having iid sample from it the first question what a statistician might do to test the hypothesis that the sample is iid. For this purpose an extension of the Plancherel measure is introduced. Recent literature on asymptotic behavior of Plancherel measure is discussed with extension to the new set up. Models for random permutations are described and the power of different tests is compared.
