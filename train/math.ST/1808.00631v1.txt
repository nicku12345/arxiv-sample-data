In a multiple testing framework, we propose a method that identifies the interval with the highest estimated false discovery rate of P-values and rejects the corresponding null hypotheses. Unlike the Benjamini-Hochberg method, which does the same but over intervals with an endpoint at the origin, the new procedure `scans' all intervals. In parallel with \citep*{storey2004strong}, we show that this scan procedure provides strong control of asymptotic false discovery rate. In addition, we investigate its asymptotic false non-discovery rate, deriving conditions under which it outperforms the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. For example, the scan procedure is superior in power-law location models.
