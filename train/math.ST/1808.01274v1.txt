In this paper, the model Y_i=g(Z_i),\ i=1,2,...,n with Z_i being random variables with known distribution and g(x) being unknown strictly increasing function is proposed and almost sure convergence of estimator for g(x) is proved for i.i.d and short range dependent data. Confidence intervals and bands are constructed for i.i.d data theoretically and confidence intervals are introduced for short range dependent data through resampling. Besides, a test for equivalence of g(x) to the desired function is proposed. Finite sample analysis and application of this model on an urban waste water treatment plant's data is demonstrated as well.
