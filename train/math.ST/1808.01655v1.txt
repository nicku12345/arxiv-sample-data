A linear multiple regression model in function spaces is formulated, under temporal correlated errors. This formulation involves kernel regressors. A generalized least-squared regression parameter estimator is derived. Its asymptotic normality and strong consistency is obtained, under suitable conditions. The correlation analysis is based on a componentwise estimator of the residual autocorrelation operator. When the dependence structure of the functional error term is unknown, a plug-in generalized least-squared regression parameter estimator is formulated. Its strong-consistency is proved as well. A simulation study is undertaken to illustrate the performance of the presented approach, under different regularity conditions. An application to financial panel data is also considered.
