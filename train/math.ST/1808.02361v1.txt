We focus on the nonparametric density estimation problem with directional data. We propose a new rule for bandwidth selection for kernel density estimation. Our procedure is automatic, fully data-driven and adaptive to the smoothness degree of the density. We obtain an oracle inequality and optimal rates of convergence for the L2 error. Our theoretical results are illustrated with simulations.
