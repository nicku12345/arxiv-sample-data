We consider optimal designs for the Kiefer cirteria, which include the E-criterion as a particular case, and the G-criterion in random coefficients regression (RCR) models. We obtain general the Kiefer criteria for approximate designs and prove the equivalence of the E-criteria in the fixed effects and RCR models. We discuss in detail the G-criterion for ordinary linear regression on specific design regions.
