We introduce novel wild bootstrap procedures for testing superiority in unpaired two-sample survival data. By combining different classical weighted logrank test we obtain tests with broader power behavior. Right censoring within the data is allowed and may differ between the groups. The tests are shown to be asymptotically exact under the null, consistent for fixed alternatives and admissible for a larger set of local alternatives. Beside these asymptotic properties we also illustrate the procedures' strength in simulations for finite sample sizes. The tests are implemented in the novel R-package mdir.logrank and its application is demonstrated in an exemplary data analysis.
