In this article,a three parameter generalisation of inverse lindley distribution is obtained, with the purpose of obtaining a more flexible model relative to the behaviour of hazard rate functions. Various statistical properties such as density, hazard rate functions, moments, moment generating functions, stochastic ordering, Renyi entropy, distribution of rth order statistics has been derived. The method of maximum likelihood estimation has been used to estimate parameters. Further confidence intervals are also obtained. Finally applicability of the proposed model to the real data is analysed. A comparison has also been made with some existing distributions.
