In this paper, we propose a new class of bivariate distributions, called the bivariate discrete inverse Weibull (BDsIW) distribution, whose marginals are discrete inverse Weibull (DsIW) distributions. Some statistical and mathematical properties are presented. The maximum likelihood method is used for estimating the model parameters. Simulations are presented to verify the performance of the direct maximum likelihood estimation. Finally, two real data sets are analyzed for illustrative purposes.
