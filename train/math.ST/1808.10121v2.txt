We consider a state-dependent, time-dependent, discrete random walks X_t^{\{a_n\}} defined on natural numbers \mathbb{N} (bent to a "stair" in \mathbb{N}^2) where the random walk depends on input of a positive deterministic sequence \{a_n\}. This walk has the peculiar property that if we set a_n to be +\infty for all n, it converges to a stationary distribution \pi(\cdot); but if a_n is uniformly bounded (over all n) by any upper bound a \in (0,\infty), this walk diverges to infinity with probability 1. It is thus interesting to consider the intermediate case where a_n<\infty for all n but a_n eventually tends to +\infty.   (Latuszynski et al., 2013) first defined this walk and conjectured that a particular choice of sequence \{a_n\} exists such that (i) a_n \to \infty and, (ii) P(X_t^{\{a_n\}} \to \infty )=1. They managed to construct a sequence \{a_n\} that satisfies (i) and P(X_t^{\{a_n\}}\to \infty)>0, which is weaker than (ii).   In this paper, we obtain a stronger result: for any \sigma<1, there exists a choice of \{a_n\} so that P(X_t\to \infty)\ge \sigma. Our result does not apply when \sigma=1, the original conjecture remains open. We record our method here for technical interests.
